"2","Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it is just not worth payhing a year in advance for it. Lots of product but I just did not use it enough to justify spending over a dollar 100 dollars a year on this. Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can not pay monthly which sucks. Maybe if they started charging monthly I would sign up again. The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought. But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."

I was not sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I do not have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I do not have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV.Thanks again.Love Amazon and Prime Amazon.Keep up the good work"
"51","Amazon",2017-04-06,4,"Good all around source for music. Pretty good availability. Not all choices available free musicare the original musicians or versions of particular songs ,you probably can purchase them . On my laptop the Playlist is a little hard to edit ."

"64","Amazon",2015-08-20,1,"Bad on a current device, but why would I put this on a current device? I can not give negative stars, or else I would. There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1. The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player. But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android. Useless app.It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog. I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."

"72","Amazon",2013-12-16,1,"New update is broken **UPDATE** New, new update even more broken! I have used this app for nearly 2 years and it is been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app chrome, facebook, a game, etc. then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I am back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.**UPDATE**I tried to create a new review, which does not work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can not give the app negative stars.The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. you have never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it is even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1 keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app which sucks - I just want to play my music but, 2 even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it will not see your music even if it is in the same folder. I have also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.I am using a Samsung Galaxy S4.Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon? winking"

"99","Amazon",2013-01-09,3,"Great concept, wish it worked better I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing. I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it is huge for me. Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon."
"100","Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually Works Well This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it does not, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
"101","Amazon",2016-11-06,5,"Five Stars Excellent product as advertized"
"110","Amazon",2015-05-15,1,"No lollipop support The app only works once per install on my 2nd Gen Moto X running lollipop. After a reboot the app consistently reports that my library is empty until I uninstall and reinstall. I am not a novice user. I have checked my authorization limit. I have even reset my phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixes this app. The fact that this problem has existed for months now shows that Amazon is not committed to maintaining this app and therefore not maintaining their music service."
"113","Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Prime time Amazon music is awesome! Since I am a prime member, I have free access to all kinds of great music. If you do not have amazon prime you should get it. The free shipping and music is definitely worth it!"
"119","Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"So very satisfied.. If you have prime, use this! My musical tastes are vast. If you sometimes vary far off the beaten path your needs will be met and expanded.So very satisfied... nothing is quite as good as being introduced to music you may like and having them hit the nail on the head.Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes."
"124","Amazon",2015-10-19,1,"Awful I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat."

"132","Amazon",2015-09-05,5,"Blown away! Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it is been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I am stoked on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!"
"134","Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix Great its part of Prime"
"137","Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Worst update ever!!! This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely. I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menus, and too may ads. And I do not know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."

"139","Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Best Music App Ever!!! This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."

"166","Amazon",2017-06-14,5,"Five Stars Greatest thing ever"
"169","Amazon",2015-07-21,1,"Fundamental Process Flaws 1 When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 clicks. Amazon forces you to load the app, wait for the library to update which takes some time, find it in the library, then download it. If the internet were ubiquitous, I would not need to download. But since it is not I download first. Please do not make this so hard.2 Each time I buy something, I am prompted to download the app with a pop us that really pushes you to download the app. I already have the app, so quit confusing me."
"190","Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"is not that bad The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can not edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it was not for that I will give it a 3."
"192","Amazon",2016-01-12,5,"Best music app! This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you are devices. There are stations recommended for you and playlists you can create by adding music to your library. it is definitely my new go-to for music. it is like combining Pandora and an MP3 player.

"210","Amazon",2014-08-18,3,"Spotify is still a better deal. I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce. Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they Amazon still want you to purchase music. If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you will like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead. Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you are going to run into problems. Seriously, at dollar 10 dollars a month dollar 5 for students first time Spotify is a far superior product."
"213","Amazon",2014-09-07,2,"Another bad marketing choice by Amazon dumped over the head of its Prime members as a bonus !?! I am a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I do not buy my music to listen to. Given that, let us just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it is almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they have added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for free. Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you have installed it! Surprise, it is part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now do not know about others. what is more, there is no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.Come on Amazon, is not it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? it is becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."

"251","Amazon",2013-12-12,4,"Thx for putting fu nction ality back in! I loved it, then there was an upgrade that broke everything... my main pain was losing lock screen controls, and shuffled lists... Well, finaly in update number 3 or number 4, the stuff is back! Amazon MP3 on my Android is usable again! I know if I had blue tooth radio, I could do without it, but as I do not - I depend on an easy way to skip a track - without unlocking the phone. I almost wish there were hot zones active if the phone is dark.. but whayt is there, is better than nothing, as was the case till few weeks ago!Not 5 stars, as the app could be better, and changes break it from time to time.. but certainly back to 4 stars!"
"252","Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffers, and stalls For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it does not transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I am not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."

"256","Amazon",2016-01-09,3,"good, but could be better. The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it."
"267","Amazon",2016-12-29,2,"Huge battery suck makes great app suck I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25 percent of the battery drain.

Logging in just would not happen until I restarted the phone, and after finally logging in, now it will not load my cloud music. It just cycles with the message Loading your cloud music... .

There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."

I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I have written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues.

"370","Amazon",2015-06-01,3,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I have used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it is not just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."
"372","Amazon",2014-06-27,1,"could not get Amazon Prime Music to quickly and conveniently download music to my phone After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone Android. I was disappointed. It allowed me to download and play one album for free. However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I did not mess with it for long, since the moment called for music streaming to a Bluetooth speaker and I did not want to take the time. So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly. I am sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I was not doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly at least for this Prime member."

"375","Amazon",2012-12-16,4,"AMAZON MP3 This app has not blown me away or anything, but it does what it is supposed to. I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that was not because it was a bad app. My phone just does not have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them."

"384","Amazon",2017-05-02,3,"Indefferent so far but it keeps asking for a review.... I can not give it much more but trying to learn how to use it better. I am used to other music apps and this is very different. I will give it a month to see for sure"
"387","Amazon",2014-06-05,1,"Amazon , release an instant video app for Android I am ticked. Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices. Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content. There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening."

Now trying to figure out about storing in the cloud and playing while streaming--or should I download the song?I am still learning but love this app. I have Amazon Prime, and they share lots of the music I like for free.Definitely my most favorite music playing app."
"396","Amazon",2015-06-19,3,"would of given 5 stars if I could copy and burn my purchased music, not the Prime, PURCHASED music I buy my music however I cannot burn my music? Yes, I understand, wholeheartedly, that we are in a new tech era where NO ONE would be caught dead burning, little on, listening to a cd, but Im not one of those sheepish lame gotta keep up with everyone douche bags... I bought my music. Therefore, I should be able to stream it, burn it, copy it as long as I do not claim it as my own; youtube. Not all cars are equipped with ipod docking devices. Mine has a good ol fashioned cd player, Thank God, oops, I didnt offend anyone by Thanking my Lord did I? I would not be apologetic anyway. I am not forcing religion on you. Just wanting to burn MY PURCHASED MUSIC!!! Otherwise than that; I would of given it 5 stars."
"397","Amazon",2016-02-12,4,"Great music app I really love this music app. I like that I can search and find almost any song. I hate using the Pandora and other apps because you have to wait forever to hear the song you really want to hear.The app does seem to force close every couple of days. Most of the time it works flawlessly. Another benefit of using prime."

They already know what albums I am going to like and suggest them so that I can add them to my play list.

"400","Amazon",2017-01-07,2,"Too difficult to deal with. I was able to ... Too difficult to deal with. I was able to download some music but I have no idea how to do it again."
"402","Amazon",2016-01-22,5,"A must have Great app! I can just listen to music on the run, or I can make playlists and mark favorites as I hear them. My favorite thing is being able to download songs for offline listening. That has to be the best feature."
"407","Amazon",2016-03-29,5,"Love the music I have been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now. I love that there are no commercials. Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices! The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!"
"409","Amazon",2017-07-18,3,"Could be more intuitive. The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion. I have one album downloaded, and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."
"410","Amazon",2015-06-08,5,"Five Stars i can not live without this, it replaced my iPod!!! i thought NOTHING could get between me and my iPod."
"416","Amazon",2017-02-06,2,"Small music selection. Confusing does not seem to be much to offer here that has music in which I am interested. I thought this was free, but then it keeps wanting me to upgrade to another level. Not much value from what I understand, especially compared to what I get on Pandora."
"423","Amazon",2017-06-02,3,"Three Stars I need a how to manual. There is no instruction"
"425","Amazon",2016-06-06,1,"Terrible customer service!!!!! Terrible customer service!!!!!"
"427","Amazon",2015-09-05,5,"Great way to listen to a wide variety of music A great service. Prime Music provides easy and ecomical access to a wide variety of music without commercial interruption. Subscribers are able to choose between listening to individual songs, albums, playlists or stations. A great deal of the music, including the playlists, stations and vintage albums, are available free to Prime Members. More recent recordings can be sampled and purchased for immediate download."

"444","Amazon",2013-03-03,4,"Good Not Perfect I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet. Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing. It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with. While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices. An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it. So far it is working well without too much difficulity."
"445","Amazon",2017-05-14,5,"👍👍 Amazon Music Android Really enjoying it. Great value"
"453","Amazon",2015-04-06,4,"Fantastic. All the music I could ever want Fantastic. All the music I could ever want. It crashes a lot though and takes a while to upload from e cloud."
"454","Amazon",2016-04-25,5,"I rarely use Prime Video, but Prime Music was an unexpected surprise! I have had Prime since it was first offered years ago, simply because it seems I order everything from Amazon and, well, like to receive things as quickly as possible. I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved! No, I do not work for Amazon! Just an honest and frankly unexpected appraisal."
"459","Amazon",2016-08-10,1,"can not Load on LG G3 I had it originally on my LG G3 phone. One day I went to use it and it was not there. I went to reinstall it and it failwd repeatedly."

You can listen to all the physical cds that u have purchased on amazons cloud the albums are automatically saved in the cloud after they are purchased and available to stream or download with this free app!!! what is not to like???"

"465","Amazon",2016-02-10,5,"LOVE IT !!!!! No longer do I have to carry around CD's anymore and haven't done so in years. Recently, I my music library was just not organized like I wanted it to be. I have several different categories rock, classical, country, alternative, comedy, Halloween sounds for trick or treaters, Christmas music for sitting around the house, etc. and have all of it totally organized in its own category. If I am in the mood for country, I will just scroll to country, hit shuffle all and hit play and all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order. Whether it is on my smartphone or on my tablet, it is well worth it !!!"
"467","Amazon",2015-07-08,1,"This app needs more functions to be a good music player I went from play music to this. This app needs more functions to be a good music player."
"471","Amazon",2017-05-02,4,"Needs desktop app The only thing that this really needs is just a stand alone desktop app like Spotify, would rather not fire up a web browser each and every time I want to use it."
"472","Amazon",2016-12-22,4,"Careful but good Is a well organized app. I would like to give it a 5 star but I just noticed that I bought a song by accident. Makes me paranoid to listen to songs That have the same name by different artists. I will be more careful in the future. Still is a great app."
"473","Amazon",2017-02-02,5,"Best Music Selection Anywhere Love, love, love my Amazon music. I listen to it at work, at the gym or at home while working around the house. It is worth the Amazon Prime membership for all the awesome perks you get with the membership! Wish I had signed on sooner."

"477","Amazon",2015-09-19,1,"Disgust I have previously ordered music from Amazon but recently after a purchase I had to download the music app. I was very disgusted having to download app just to hear music I had bought. My phone was then bombarded with ads. This sucks."
"478","Amazon",2016-12-05,1,"... my music benefits if I pay as Prime user like everyone else Amazon is an App used worldwide so why if I have to be in Panama o another country out of USA or Spain etc I can not use my music benefits if I pay as Prime user like everyone else??? Very disappointed with this app cause I am unable to use it."
"482","Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"I love my Prime Music I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iHeart with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played. There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues."
"483","Amazon",2016-06-15,3,"Its ok it is ok. does not have all the songs I like, like Spotify does but it is free with prime so I like it. I cancelled Spotify sometimes I wish I did not."
"488","Amazon",2016-03-23,3,"Generally good app I listen to this app daily. It is lacking some functionality, but creating playlists is super easy. This app would be better of you could select the music folder to pull from on an sd card. Also, the last patch broke the continuous repeat one song function. The song only repeats once and then app closes."
"490","Amazon",2016-11-22,5,"Must have !!!!!! Five ***** I am telling everyone I know how amazing the music app is. NO commercials. List to what songs you want, as many times as you want. You do NOT have to listen to music because they want you to. Easy to set up with new releases, or old favorites."
"492","Amazon",2015-07-03,3,"Nice to not hear ads, but pre-mixed playlists are not the best. Should recommend other songs similar to what you are listening to. Also, most radio/playlists suck. Switched to Google Play because they have free playlists with ads but a great Gym mix. Step up your game Amazon! I pretty much give them 1/2 my paycheck every two weeks because I love Amazon stuff. This is not doing it for me though... but I am sure they will algorithm it out soon."
"496","Amazon",2016-02-04,4,"I BE JAMMIN Use it all the time, I love the unlimited skips and no commercials. I find living here on Kauai where cell reception is spotty the fact that the app caches some of the data that is being played I experience no skips in the music that is being played even while dipping in and out of service. Keep up the good job Amazon!"
"497","Amazon",2017-06-13,5,"Best App I have This is the best app, I listen to music everyday, even when I am exercising. Or riding in the car."
"498","Amazon",2017-09-05,1,"Not what it appears. Sadly the Amazon Prime Music is a dupe to get the user to subscribe to the more expensive program."
"507","Amazon",2014-07-26,5,"once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is I was very reluctant to purchase Amazon Prime to obtain free shipping on all purchases because I only occasionally purchase items on Amazon. However, once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is an extremely good deal. And, I think I will be even more satisfied with Amazon Prime membership when I get time to explore the free video library that is available as an Amazon Prime member."
"508","Amazon",2016-06-30,1,"not user friendly Hard to get to the music difinitely not user friendly... Very limited selection of music in the playlist/genere... I will stay with Pandora..."
"513","Amazon",2016-05-10,5,"I love Amazon music I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I do not use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with."
"516","Amazon",2016-06-15,5,"Not to bad.. Really like it. I just wish they had more music choices in Prime. I have had to buy alot of the songs I like because they were not listed in Prime."
"517","Amazon",2016-10-31,4,"Good Deal at dollar 3.99 a month for music on the Amazon Echo Well worth the dollar 3.99 a month for music on our Amazon Echo. I have asked Echo to play some songs I thought it would not have and Amazon Music Unlimited has found every one of them. If you have got an Echo I would say try it for this price it is a good deal!"
"519","Amazon",2014-06-19,5,"More music than you can listen to in a lifetime! I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I was not too worried about having enough music to listen to. However, the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites. I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out. The catalog from some of the top labels are not available, but it is still an impressive collection!"
"521","Amazon",2017-04-15,5,"Five Stars Love that it includes some free music with prime. I would rather listen and then buy."
"522","Amazon",2016-06-29,2,"it stinks! I would rather it have gone to my play music app but I did not have a choice. It took forever to figure out what happened to my downloads. Then I listened which went fine but once I got out, I could not find it again. There is no icon. Still haven't found it. I hate this program!"
"526","Amazon",2016-07-30,4,"Cant find my music I chose my prime songs, went to download them like normal, it says they down load, to where? there is no option to chose where to save music to on this app, not that I can find anymore.

"527","Amazon",2015-05-03,4,"This is a great music service This is a great music service. I like how you can skip songs as much as you want, as well as having the ability to go back to a previous song. So far I am very impressed with the assortment of songs."

For Android users there is no options to purchase music like iPhone/iTunes users can. Get with the times man!"
"558","Amazon",2016-02-04,4,"Worth the price of admission! The streaming music and video services of Amazon are worth the annual fee.

The user interface is a bit perplexing, and takes some getting used to, and that is why i did not give it 5 stars.

"588","Amazon",2011-08-10,3,"Room for improvement but good nonetheless The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really do not have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan happy Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes mad . Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."
"595","Amazon",2016-06-06,3,"Meh Music plays well, but no way to rate songs in the mobile app. The music selection is very limited and by no way competes with Google Music."

While both user interfaces are sluggish, Amazon MP3 player is by far the worse of the two....to the point of being unusable on my EVO 3d. There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections. Instead, look at Google Music or Audiogalaxy the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day. Both have android clients with usable, albiet slow interfaces for large collections."

The whole concept is still settling in on my brain. I do like the sample songs, but you have to keep pressing the new song when one is over, they do not just play, one after the other. Dont chuckle at me, Im new to this stuff.....Amazon continues to be a world of wonder and fun, and the music is just another facet of this diamond"
"633","Amazon",2013-03-12,5,"a simple review I will keep this simple and not write pages of exhausting material. This is a perfectly simple player with big time added perks:It links to your cloud and almost all cd purchases you have ever made on Amazon.it is on Roku for easy connection to a home surround system.You can add your own non-Amazon purchased mp3s and download the files to your drive of choice for further use.The player can be loaded onto multiple devices that all access your material.To sum up, this is a highly flexible and functional player. Recommend!"

I have a huge music library on microSD and flash drives and on my PC as well as in Amazon's cloud library.I can stream it through my Sony BluRay player to my with screen mirroring from my tablet - but I have to keep the tablet plugged in to keep playing for multiple hours. I do not bother from my phone, except for streaming music during dental work when I can connect, or on my phone during longish drives, plugged into the car charger.I wish they would fix it so it only started and ran when invited to do so! And to make it actually stop when stopped!"
"636","Amazon",2016-07-07,5,"Makes Prime worth it. The music selection available with Prime music has been poor in the past but recently I have been very pleased with the selection and have actually had difficulties finding music they do not have. Prime music is definitely a great bonus to the Prime subscription."

"642","Amazon",2016-05-11,2,"Drains my Phone Battery!! I love Amazon Music and the fact that you can download the music for offline listening but the fact that it drains my battery kills me. I will not even have the app running in the background or anything and I will come back to my phone in 2 hours and 50 percent of the battery is drained."
"647","Amazon",2016-01-23,3,"Fee or not to fee....what was the question? I am not a fan of annual fees that only provide SOME of the service, and peretual nickle and dime fees for eternity. Either pay as you go or make the annual subscription all-inclusive. Other than that, the music that IS included with the subscription fee is pretty extensive, so I am kinda just nit picking."
"656","Amazon",2017-06-10,3,"Unlimited service killed Prime Music. Was so much better until they launched their Unlimited service. I guess my Prime membership is not worth as much as it used to be."
"657","Amazon",2017-08-28,5,"Five Stars Love the music app I can take my music anywhere I go on all my devices"

"661","Amazon",2016-11-27,3,"Generic Playlist are just okay and new music could be guessed...wish more independent were hyped...how about imports and one time issues from artists? Not even an option to buy...music has far more fast or a lexicon...generic app!"

"673","Amazon",2014-11-10,5,"Outstanding Best site for music ever. I have never had a problem using Amazon Music and with Prime Music tons of my favorite music is free!! Yippee!"
"675","Amazon",2016-06-17,4,"what is not too like.. Music ALL day, what is not too like... Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of hours, about 8hrs, music does repeat."
"686","Amazon",2015-08-03,5,"Great App Great app. Was able to easily get and download the albums I bought on Amazon. The app was automatically updated once I purchased the album and when I opened the app I could easily download the albums to my phone and tablet."
"689","Amazon",2015-12-09,2,"Will cancel subscription. Aside from the free delivery, the movies that are presented are way outdated. And I already have Rhapsody, so I have no use forAmazon Prime music. I intend to cancel the subscription. Amazon Prime, needs to get better up to date movies to watch. Thatwould make the subscription more worthwhile."
"691","Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Music is great! Once I get it I need help bringing up the original classic rock and roll mixed that I had the first time. Music is great! Once I get it."
"695","Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Does not load - lovely exception message though Downloaded this on a Nexus 5, every time it starts it just complains that it is not authenticated and errors out. This is before any prompt asking for authentication or anything. Downloaded from both the Amazon appstore and Google Play. Same result.When Amazon innovates Kindle, One-Click, Prime shipping they hit grand slams. When they copy Kindle Fire, Appstore, Prime TV, Fire TV, Prime Music, phone?? they come up way short."
"697","Amazon",2015-10-07,5,"No comercials with prime. I love it! It is so much cooler than Pandora. Especially since I have Prime. No comercials!"
"699","Amazon",2015-04-15,5,"Music is music. This, however, is bundlized with other benefits The music talks! I guess this is a good deal, when compared to, for example, Spotify. You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free but not really. Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."
"704","Amazon",2015-07-23,5,"Better than iTunes - Haven't tried the Apple music, but this is great! Wow! What a great way to discover new music, create your own playlist or listen to one of theirs. Those songs that are Prime Eligible free you can also download to your device. do not know if I will go back to iTunes again."
"714","Amazon",2015-12-07,5,"I love my Amazon Prime I love my Amazon Prime. There are so many qualities about Prime, I honestly dont know where to start. I get 2 day delivery for free. I also get free music that comes with a lot of options. You can also at friends to the Prime membership. There are so many benefits you must get to explore all of them."
"720","Amazon",2016-10-19,1,"One Star Will not down load, last version was not broke,so why did you fix it ????"
"724","Amazon",2016-11-29,2,"what happened to just free streaming? Bah! do not so much care that they are looking for the monthly fee for streaming now. That makes me rather sad. Miss it just being a part of my Prime. This doubles the cost of my Prime on an annual basis. Disappointing."
"729","Amazon",2015-12-19,2,"Constant buffering Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason. No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies. Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy. Playlist options are great, love the music. Same issue on laptop and mobile. Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."
"737","Amazon",2015-08-05,4,"Needs accessible comedy. Decent application, but does not have the selection of many of the other music streaming apps.Sound quality is good.Apparently, I was mistaken. There is comedy on amazon prime, but there is no way to search for it by genre. I find it irritating that I can only find comedians by searching for them by name. This needs to be improved."
"739","Amazon",2013-07-05,3,"do not use it, do not need yet another competing source of music I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying. Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service. Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.If they are going to DRM things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house. If I buy an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I am using online to listen to it. Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?.Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.And of course speakers on phones suck.So, Music?I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another source of music.I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service. And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface downloading, it worked okay. But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.So so so....If you use it, more power to you."

"977","Amazon",2013-07-13,5,"Works great All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that is a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it is on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever is not on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I will come back to it. Cheers, Jerry"

Really?I am sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."

"1032","Amazon",2016-09-09,1,"Was good until most recent update...now is horrible. I used this app for many years and it worked great. I uploaded thousands of songs to the cloud and could play them back with no problem. I was a Power user according to the app. Then came the most recent update...I can no longer play the songs I uploaded to the cloud. I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed. Based on the reviews I have seen here, it seems I am far from the only one who has had this problem. If the app has received this many one star reviews in a short period and nothing is being done to fix it, it should tell us something."
"1037","Amazon",2016-05-15,4,"just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app I do not use it as much as I should seeing that if you pay for a Prime Membership, one should use the service. Thing is, that after you shut it off, the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.Second, it is hard to find a specific album... let us say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you playlists of groups similar to the Doobies. So I will get my South City Midnight Lady and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. surprised "

The sound quality is appreciably better with Amazon Music on a PC than I can get with Pandora. Amazon Music does not have all of the music I want, but the ability to specify which song I want to play and to rewind or replay a song is useful."
"1112","Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"Garbage Not impressed at ALL. Music is hard to find, most of what I want to listen to I have to pay for even with a PRIME subs. XBOX music is superior in every possible way. Even the XBM Android app is better than this POS. VERY disappointed.

"1118","Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Nice music service by Amazon I like the Amazon Prime Music service for a few reasons.

Then on Saturday it asked me to update Adobe Flash Player, which I did, but I still could not stream music. I continued to get the Flash Player error message. Tried rebooting, re-downloading, deleting Flash Player all together and trying again. Deleted my cache. Then tried again on Sunday. Still can not stream music. I give up."
"1128","Amazon",2013-09-29,2,"Ok but not what expected if you live outside the US Hi Amazon people, i know this is part of your policies but i think its not fair to restrict songs shopping if you dont live in the US. some of us are loyal customers over the years and at least we deserve to be elected to pay for music if we wanted to. I hope things get better in the future. if i could buy mp3s and use your app this would be a rocking 5 stars review."

I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. it is just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! it is all there, in one place.

This is all about David Bowie right now.Amazon did a great service in making sure Black Star was listenable for free. I will grant that. They did not have to, and that is a credit to them.But given that he would just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free? Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise. If I now want to listen to Bowie I have got to buy it from you? Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we are talking about here.I will gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now. Right now? Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free? For a few days, and then ended it? would not that have been the high minded thing to do?"

"1305","Amazon",2014-10-14,3,"No SD card support and some recordings not original I really was not sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it is just OK since the app is not all that bad lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I would have to stay with 3 stars.Issue number 1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I could not move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can not play any prime music, but that is OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue number 2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that did not make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I am sure there are many more. Disappointing."

"1319","Amazon",2016-09-26,5,"I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music. The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you do not like to listen to the same stuff over and over it is not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you do not get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there is not a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT."

Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were.The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app!P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones"

"1519","Amazon",2015-06-26,3,"nice selections and features for Prime but poor performance. Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player does not work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it is really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I will pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon took over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all."

"1565","Amazon",2011-03-31,5,"Works great! The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I have been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem."
"1566","Amazon",2014-12-09,5,"Great app with free music! Amazon Prime Music is a great app! It is free, and they offer a ton of free playlists and albums with great music available.

The player then was playing two songs simultaneously. I could not get it to stop. Every time I pressed play, i was listening to hall and oates at the same time it was playing simply red. I also could not find an exit or quit option. Never had that issue with Pandora."

"1599","Amazon",2015-04-20,3,"Good, but could use a better interface. I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials, but listening to a particular genre is not so easy. It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also, not all artists are available, so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."
"1602","Amazon",2017-06-19,5,"Five Stars Love Amazon music! So easy to use!"
"1607","Amazon",2013-05-19,4,"Pretty awesome we have moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it is really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it does not always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it does not recognize it."
"1610","Amazon",2016-08-16,2,"Not as good as other music apps. Limited selection and oldies. can not really compare to other music apps in terms of the latest hits. Maybe they will eventually catch up with more recent music?"
"1613","Amazon",2016-08-28,4,"4 Stars for 90 percent Great app, but still only have 90 percent of the songs I am looking for. Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all, but until then.. 4 stars"

"1636","Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music App Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice."
"1639","Amazon",2015-11-21,5,"Better than Rhapsody This app is way better than most of the competitors out there. I also have rhapsody and it is horrible unless your somewhere that has a strong wifi signal. This app actually works sometimes with just the mobile network."
"1641","Amazon",2012-12-22,4,"Good but Amazon could make this a bit better. Integration is great I love that you can actually stream music from the cloud unlike iTunes match. Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing. I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser. If there was a user friendly desktop interface like iTunes they would have five stars. Keep working on it amazon you have my business, I hope you continue to develope your music products."

"1658","Amazon",2015-06-27,5,"Five Stars ok"
"1662","Amazon",2011-11-12,3,"Could be killer Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large 18K song music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service will not allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and does not handle changes to playlists well."
"1666","Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"Love, love, love it!!! I downloaded Prime Music on Prime Day and just love it!

"1676","Amazon",2015-12-02,5,"Amazon Music remembered. Found all the old CD's I purchased from Amazon over the last 15 years and loaded all.Excellent as I forgot about some of them.Amazon did not, even though Amazon Music player did not exist in the way back."
"1677","Amazon",2016-06-22,4,"some of the groups I like are not allowing their material to be offered to stream The only complaint I have is at times it lags and the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to, most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like are not allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore, THEY, groups like Metallica, can pucker up and... well, let us keep this age appropriate and kid friendly.Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth and it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library, it is an awesome tool to have for those I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS at dollar dollar and percent dollar UP moments."
"1678","Amazon",2014-06-20,3,"Close, but no cigar. Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all free music.

"1695","Amazon",2015-05-01,3,"Not for my phone. I am sure it would work wonderfully if I had unlimited data or maybe if I was using an amazon device. But for my galaxy, I find that it consumes too much memory and streams away my data. I uninstalled for this reason."

"1738","Amazon",2014-02-01,5,"Great for my phone This might be free to download, but I have to say it probably costs me more money to keep it just for the simple fact that it is too easy to buy songs with it. Over all its great because I can access my purchased songs, there are no adds, and finding songs are just as easy. Maybe one day they can add it a song finder where the app listens, and finds the song?"
"1740","Amazon",2016-06-11,5,"Five Stars Alot of music, free to prime members."
"1741","Amazon",2016-01-07,5,"All services should be good for everyone in household Would have been better if the Prime membership has all of the benefits for all in the same house holdi think they give it to 3 household members which is fine, but the free music is only for the member."
"1747","Amazon",2015-09-14,5,"Really Awesome Music!!! Uses to use Pandora but now on all my rides Motorcycle I listen to Prime Music. It plays all the tracks I have asked it too and adds some really good tracks that compliment my list as opposed to other apps that just toss them in."
"1748","Amazon",2016-02-27,5,"L❤️VE 😻 I have been using it for a couple weeks and so far I love it. I love being able to stream a whole album if that is what I feel like doing. Or using the suggested playlists are pretty good too."

"1791","Amazon",2014-06-22,5,"love this new music option great streaming option for desktops. I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.Only thing I do not like is there is a pause between songs.

I do not know about you, but I prefer to store photos and music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally, I do not like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother????So this is now a 100 percent useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee dollar 20 a year, it is just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership."

Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player. The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player. You can not bypass this anymore. There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet. Uninstalled."

"1836","Amazon",2015-09-25,4,"Incredible Music Selection! Very impressed with the selection and genres - how intuitive the app is at identifying songs based on what I like. The option to add to the cloud, a group I specify or download to my phone with unlimited skips amazed me!"

"2057","Amazon",2015-04-10,4,"Good player when it works. Works well with Prime. The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.The UI has gotten much better over the last year.

"2119","Amazon",2013-01-29,3,"Nice but could be more I have moved all my music to Amazon Cloud Player, as Google Music was limiting and iTunes Match was a joke for me. Really l ike the service. But Amazon has invested so much, seems like they would invest in a more robust app for their music. But it is a simple easy to use app. Play back is good, but not excellent, has so much potential."

"2133","Amazon",2014-06-22,4,"Awesome ! When I was told about this opportunity, it did not faze me until I was shown the range of music to choose from.

"2150","Amazon",2015-06-14,5,"I absolutely love this app I absolutely love this app. It is very useful. I find it has replaced Pandara for me and you have unlimited skips between music. Amazon prime allows you to download many songs/albums for free as long as you have amazon prime."

"2188","Amazon",2016-06-23,5,"Five Stars Love it."
"2192","Amazon",2015-03-29,2,"A lot of hard work and it may function This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it does not. It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I have always installed from the play store, let us see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE, LG G3, that just might run amazon prime music, but it is just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
"2196","Amazon",2014-12-06,1,"Interesting concepts, but fatally flawed. I just wish the damned thing would work consistently. I thought it was purely a lack of support for the One Plus One, but it does not work correctly on either of my previous Nexus phones. My Library is hamstrung in an ecosystem that I can not take with me on the go."
"2198","Amazon",2014-06-17,1,"Bad music for me Loaded it on my android phone an removed ten minutes later. Let me know when there are options available other than POP. I even looked at the Latin selections, looked pretty miserable.Pandora has it right!"
"2205","Amazon",2017-03-16,1,"Amazon does not support Blackberry Android After a lot of back-and-forth escalating to a manager in the tech area, finally Amazon said they specifically stopped supporting Blackberry Android systems."

"2211","Amazon",2013-08-20,3,"MP3 Kindle If you are not a tech, it hard to use the cloud and sinc of your play list to the Kindle. Instructions are over the top and hard to get your arms around it. The younger generation has had IPOD forever and it is a no brainer but me being a baby boomer, it take a little more information and asking questions to several other people to get it all working right!"
"2216","Amazon",2016-06-16,4,"Four Stars I like it"
"2220","Amazon",2016-06-05,5,"Five Stars Love it!!!!!"
"2224","Amazon",2014-09-13,2,"Could be much better. I expect more of Amazon. UI anyone? The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."
"2229","Amazon",2014-07-28,3,"Neh... It prompts me that I need to be prime to use it, even though I am already prime user. You need to browse for albums every time you want to add music, you can not add music like with google play when you just move the cursor over the album and right click to add to your library or playlist."
"2230","Amazon",2017-04-28,1,"One Star I am unaware that I ordered, or paid for, any music.Please enlighten me."

"2246","Amazon",2015-08-21,3,"This app is great on mobile This app is great on mobile, but on a computer? Terrible. Terrible enough for me to knock off two stars without hesitation. It will not sync properly and completely ignores music that I have bought in the past."

You know, I buy your kindles, I think we are on like 8 or 9 now for the family, we pay for Prime, we rent movies, we bought a Fire and now in your ever gluttonous, ravenous need for greed you now want us to pay seven flipping ninty- five a month for the privilege of what we had for free before.

The sound is not as good as other apps, it does not read my other playlists and it got corrupted somehow on my phone. After deleting it and reinstalling this app about 15 times, it finally worked as it used to.. Without my amazon prime music playlists. Badly done, Amazon. Please put some work and pride into your music app!!!"

I was disappointed that the Prime fee was going up, but now with Prime TV, exclusive HBO AND prime music....it is OK. I am kind of missing some genres and there is no Marshall Mathers albums but that is OK because they are already in my cloud."
"2403","Amazon",2015-12-06,5,"Best app on the market Best music app on the market. I can listen to many good Christian songs and even download them on my phone through Wi-Fi to listen to later so I do not have to use my data."
"2404","Amazon",2014-06-26,4,"Great! I like it a lot! Has a lot of popular music I mostly listen to country music so that is what this is based on and even songs that were not popular, but that I like. It did not have a few of the artists that I searched for and that is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Otherwise, I love it!"
"2406","Amazon",2014-11-24,1,"Pointless app I had to download this app just so I could download ONE SONG to my music player. I do not think I will be buying music from Amazon again.

"2424","Amazon",2015-04-08,2,"it is a great idea. I would change this rating if I could play my Prime music from my sd card. I have allot of memory available but can not even use it. Even if I manually move the Prime downloads to my sd card. The music choice itself is awesome."

"2426","Amazon",2014-10-01,3,"Could be MUCH better... This app would not work on my RAZR...However, it works as intended which is not to say smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...THE GOOD:*Prime Music - Free with Prime, I did not have that feature when I subscribed, so it is a plus. I have found around 10 albums on Prime that I did not already have, so I can listen for Free and see if I want to buy them permanently.*I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.*Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...THE BAD:*Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I do not see a way to do that.*Storage of offline listening music can not be moved, no option for it...*does not resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I do not really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.*I do not seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I do not want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...You can do better Amazon..."

"2440","Amazon",2017-09-10,5,"Five Stars All the music I want at the same place. Just search what you want and it is there."
"2446","Amazon",2017-03-07,5,"An important addition to Android Phones... Get it!! I had purchased quite a few items that could be played on my new Android Phone. The app worked perfectly with totally clear sound.One thing I could wish for: In the case of complete albums, it would be nice to select from the artwork rather than scrolling endlessly through all the songs. I have 837 songs, mostly from complete albums. To go through that many to select one near the end of the list would be very time consuming. Just a thought."
"2447","Amazon",2016-07-17,3,"Had a playlist over 40 hours of music. It ... Had a playlist over 40 hours of music. It stopped playing all Shinedown songs, had to delete playlist and start over."

There is no access to playing music from the cloud . I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.Update - Turns out the issue is with the device. A reboot and the app works fine. This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device. So I will be knocking a star of my Acer review."

I can not imagine not being an Amazon prime member Music, Movies, Books and free shipping on the things I buy what more could I want? Thank you Amazon!"
"2474","Amazon",2014-07-27,4,"A great app with one major drawback. This is a great app for taking advantage of the 'Prime Music' benefit. The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it were not for this I would rate this app 5 stars."

"2552","Amazon",2011-05-24,4,"Great App... need some bug work. Great app. I use it on a Xoom and it works almost fine.

"3035","Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"OK but could be better. I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary. The interface is not intutive and there does not seem to be much help. Maybe I am doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious. The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc. The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new 2000 to now stuff that I have never heard of. Not that I stay on top of modern music much I am 61. I might fool around with it some more to make sure I am not doing something wrong but if I can not get the music I am interested in I do not see the point. I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone. I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."

"3103","Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"BAH! Amazon Music with Prime I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it is totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I have emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall yesterday. What a pain. I definitely do not want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I am listening to. Who cares? And that is an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I do not like this and I am very unhappy with it? I am starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

I month later I got the bill for dollar 99.00 for a year. I thought OUCH! Then I started looking into it. I was able to create play lists of my favorite music on my lap top and, after downloading the app, onto my cell-phone. I was able to log into Amazon Prime at work and play my type music for free on my work computer. At work I have no CD/DVD drive at work, this makes it difficult to listen to my kind of music to be more productive. I haven't really even started with the videos."

"3433","Amazon",2017-04-03,1,"Wipes playlsts, shuts down all by itself. I love Amazon. I love Amazon music. I only want to buy my music from Amazon. I would love to be able to play my Amazon music with my Amazon music app. But it sucks. I start it, it just shuts down. I start it again, get my band picked on Prime, or my library shuts down again.Since I have had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I have done that multiple times. If you all do not do something I am going to migrate to a different company. I do not want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad."

"3473","Amazon",2016-10-27,4,"Overall great! No ads and nice quality audio! Good alternative to radio stations especially if you do not want to deal with ads. Prime members should take advantage of the free music streaming that Amazon provides! I haven't yet streamed music with the Amazon Music app without wifi yet, but so far it has been relatively smooth and the audio is high quality.The only downside is that it seems you would have to choose another playlist once the current one is finished, or else the music just stops. It is only a drawback because I like to listen to music for long periods of time and it is a bit bothersome to constantly pick another playlist once one is over."

"3507","Amazon",2014-11-17,1,"Not So Great! Not very useful, does not work or compatible on all of the Amazon devices. Kind of strange Amazon would develop something that does not work on all of their devices. But this is what I have come to expect."

Maybe I haven't the found the feature, but it does not seem like this will play songs based on something you are currently listening to. There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own. But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs. I do not know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above. I would have been a great feature, and I would give it four or five stars then."

"4155","Amazon",2013-12-17,2,"Amazon Cloud is great, but Android app has some killer limitations I pay dollar 25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I am very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I have got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.So far, so good.But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:1 It will not download music to your SD cardI bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I did not have a connection and also so I would not have to worry about using too much data.But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can not be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. that is why I bought the SD card from Amazon!. Google Music let us you download to SD - you can too!2 It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloudI was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I will just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it knew that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!3 No gapless playback.Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."

"4529","Amazon",2016-02-01,3,"Unfinished Product There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing. I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there is no way to undo this action. Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error. it is also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on. Rating the song on one station should not affect the other. If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I am already an Amazon Prime member. number AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me."

"4542","Amazon",2017-04-25,1,"Amazon music app is abysmal and should be avoided at all cost This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse. It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often. Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along. All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it did not add them to my phone. I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more."

One huge complaint, however, is when I download music to my phone's SD card or create a playlist on my phone as opposed to in my cloud. My music and playlists keep disappearing from my memory card!!!

"4976","Amazon",2014-10-14,2,"not what I was hoping for. I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I do not want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."

"7370","Amazon",2013-01-14,3,"A perfectly decent solution Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this. it is a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone. And the player is...acceptable. It plays music, and does not glitch up trying to do it.However, the more you use the player, the more you will find it is not all you want. you will listen to an album, and then it will just stop; it will not keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. you will want to do one thing, and you will accidentally do another. you will never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it is not the perfect answer.If you want something with tons of options and personalization, look elsewhere for your music app. If you are looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here."

I can access my personal playlists easily. Amazon playlists are just as easy to access, navigate and choose by genre and mood. Even better, if I like a song on one of Amazon's playlists, I can add it to my personal playlist with just a couple of touches.

I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years.I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist even with a name like Todd Rundgren the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."

"9710","Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Zero stars -useless for mobile purposes, purchases still go to internal memory, deleted all play lists on my device. The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine, but I feel like I have lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising listening whilst in motion.You now have to stop, go to additional screens with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!, and take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc..Unacceptable from both a safety car and /or usability standpoint exercise.When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile eg: hear a song in a store that you like- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. !!!My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it is an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you are sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is.Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I now know that I should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc..Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.I do not sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi.When I am on a road trip- it is my bandwidth that is used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I do not need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I am at home, fine. But it simply does not serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it is incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I will not be using their app will not be running across products to buy."

"10405","Amazon",2013-02-13,1,"HATE this app HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself does not indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that is too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, and it makes me HATE Amazon."

If you find a song that you like you may have to pay for it. I guess I had the wrong idea about it. I thought all songs would be free and available to do anything that I wanted to do with them.

Considering that playing a local audio file has been done smoothly by PCs since about 1988, this is a big disappointment. If it was not required to utilize my Amazon Prime music, I would ditch this one in a heartbeat. I have already wasted too many minutes of my life working with this app."

"10776","Amazon",2013-02-07,4,"syncs music very well to multiple devices The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"

WHEN I CLICK ON A PLAYLIST IN MY LIBRARY I CAN NEVER GET THE PLAYLIST TO PLAY ON MY CELL PHONE...KEEP GETTING MESSAGE ERROR...PLEASE TRY BACK LATER OR CONTACT AMAZON. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH AMAZON AND THEIR PRODUCTS PRIME TV, FIRE TABLETS ETC.

"10912","Amazon",2014-01-04,5,"Music Music and more Music! This is a great app for my phone,mp3 player and tablet. If I do not want to sync to my music on my toys I can still hear them all thru cloud. I like buying singles alot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do alot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!"
"10916","Amazon",2011-10-04,1,"No longer great Shame on amazon. This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen, nor can you search for it through the app!!!! sad"

"10920","Amazon",2012-09-09,5,"Mp3 I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems."
"10921","Amazon",2012-02-14,5,"Simple, Secure, and Safe Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's cloud was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go.The MP3 downloader was even easier...Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I do not have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! YAY!!! happy"
"10925","Amazon",2011-09-03,3,"Nice, but now broken I really loved this app, but now it locks up my atrix, will use google music until they figure it out.... Please get it fixed"
"10928","Amazon",2014-10-23,4,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums ... Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I am not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it is not a big deal.Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone 3.5 phone. I also see that it runs a bit sluggish 1 ghz phone.Again, pretty good app and I am happy with it. Hopefully we will see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
"10930","Amazon",2011-10-31,3,"Moved on I got away from this Amazon app and moved on to a generic app. Music Search and Download is what I use now."
"10932","Amazon",2011-10-09,1,"No more free song Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star."
"10935","Amazon",2014-04-16,4,"love it Now I can have my music whereever I go without having to take along a separate mp player. my grandkids like it because it has their favorite music on there as well. You can play from the cloud or download to your mobile device."
"10936","Amazon",2015-03-03,1,"it is almost like they do not want you to use it Oh, man...I was really hoping this would allow me to get rid of Spotify Premium and save some dollar dollar each month. False. This app has one of the least user-friendly interfaces I have ever experienced. it is almost like they do not want you to use it...I am really hoping they get this fixed, because it was a large part of why I renewed my Prime membership for another year."
"10938","Amazon",2011-04-26,4,"Keeps getting better The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets, 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up."
"10948","Amazon",2013-12-16,5,"My music on my device! I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on. Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices. However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want. Also, I am always able to stream the music when data connected from the Amazon Cloud.Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!"
"10950","Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Auto-Rip Rocks! I am an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I am still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it is still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I am enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
"10952","Amazon",2016-05-16,4,"Love amazon music! Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I am on a different station on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far, is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I am really liking this whole service and app!"
"10961","Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App I can not get enough of Amazon prime music. The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app. The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
"10965","Amazon",2017-06-23,5,"Great tunes Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's did not hammer us with usage charges"

"10976","Amazon",2015-03-19,5,"Music I have listened to a lot of the Prime Music that I had lost track of through the years. It is hard to keep up with the format changes, records, tapes, 8-tracks,and CD's. For instance....I hadn't listened to Joni Mitchell in years and found her music as delightful as I did in the 60's. I have a bluetooth speaker to use with my Android, and a computer connected to my A-V system and it has been wonderful to have access to so much music in an instant."
"10978","Amazon",2017-03-30,5,"Five Stars I love my Amazon Music. It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime."
"10979","Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"does not work I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs will not download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to device vs sd card. How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that does not work and does not seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! you are better than this Amazon, I paid almost dollar 100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
"10983","Amazon",2017-06-21,1,"Boooooo Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago"
"10987","Amazon",2016-01-19,2,"Great idea, but annoying I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it is practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.Back to Google play music I go. mad"
"10993","Amazon",2017-06-24,2,"Two Stars New, haven't figured out how to use yet. 7/31/17 still have not used this. please cancel anything that I have to pay for. it is too technical for me to enjoy. I signed up for a free month, but I have not used it and I want it cancelled. please do not charge me for any music, or videos.please cancel this. thanks, Rosemary"
"10994","Amazon",2012-08-03,4,"works great Not sure why people give this one star just because they can not uninstall it. that is not the apps fault that you bought a phone with pre loaded apps. I use this on a galaxy nexus and it works great. It remains to be seen how the improvements to the cloud player will affect those who do not pay but I have been pleased with Amazon cloud player since I started using it."
"10995","Amazon",2014-10-14,5,"Great Music App! Great music app with a ton of free music if you have Amazon Prime. I love it!"
"10997","Amazon",2017-06-22,5,"Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better. Its waaaay louder than spotify was. I had to max my car out and have treble all the way up to hear songs. Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better."
"10998","Amazon",2017-02-09,5,"Love this app I get all the music I want, right to my phone. I love this."
"10999","Amazon",2014-10-22,4,"Four Stars Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members."
"11000","Amazon",2017-03-23,1,"If you do not want to pay, you are only allowed to look So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app? Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to free music with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
"11001","Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"it is music to my ears One of the unexpected benefits of Amazon prime is the music service that comes with it. Download the Amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files. You can stream them our download them to your phone. They are available as full albums, individual songs, or listen to preselected playlists. Get Amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it."
"11002","Amazon",2015-01-14,5,"Five Stars Easy to use, great selection of free music if you are a prime member."
"11007","Amazon",2017-05-05,4,"Four Stars there is some decent music on it but the variety is limited."
"11008","Amazon",2017-06-04,5,"I love my Prime membership I am a music love and as such, will try out everything available. Amazon is the most recent musical trip I have taken and it might be that I have reached my home for music. I have been a Prime member for many years and it is paid for itself over and over. This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."
"11013","Amazon",2014-10-13,1,"Frequent errors and crashes App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible"
"11019","Amazon",2017-03-25,5,"Answers All Of My Music Needs For Now Very good deal for dollar 8 per month!"
"11021","Amazon",2017-06-19,5,"Great app!! Unlike other music apps we have tried Amazon music does not have ads or commercials and I love that."
"11022","Amazon",2014-07-09,1,"Garbage in the first degree Garbage in the first degree...a long time amazon music purchaser...now I am shut out as on my samsung S3 downloads are not in my library...uninstalled reinstalled wasted a lot of time...now can not login to it on my phone...I am very tech savvy so the fault is with the amazon music app...deleted...used to work great...on to spotify or dare I say...iTunes...ugh"
"11023","Amazon",2014-06-13,1,"WTF... Seriously! Broke will not work on Samsung Galaxy Note. Tried Google play and Amazon apps, Google says it is already downloaded it is not and Amazon says it is incompatible... Seriously, WTF?"
"11025","Amazon",2011-11-07,1,"No Genre? REALLY?? I can not believe it but I do not see a way to play all music by genre. This option appears in the web based player but its not on the Android software.How can this be left out??One star until this is fixed. The Google music beta wins hands-down.This is a must have feature!Boo."
"11029","Amazon",2014-06-17,5,"Yay! Finally! This is great so far, I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music, so the transition was not bad for me. My only criticism is that their catalog for streaming is not that big, but I understand that this is because the service is brand new. I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase. Thank you Amazon!"
"11031","Amazon",2014-10-21,4,"Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was ... Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there is always a little freeze in the playback when I am streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I am really satisfied"
"11034","Amazon",2014-04-23,4,"App works well. I like being able to get my Cloud music and play it on my phone. The one problem I have with it is that without me adding them in there it picked up ringtones I had downloaded to my phone and put them in my list of songs. I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well."
"11040","Amazon",2015-01-25,4,"yeah it works yeah it works"
"11044","Amazon",2013-02-11,5,"10 STARS Perfect. Fast downloads. Much better than itunes. The new auto-rip feature for cds is wonderful. I hope it will include vinyl in the future. Sooner rather than later Love it love it love it!!!"
"11046","Amazon",2013-02-20,5,"Works great! This is my go-to app for all music now. Once you go Amazon, you can not go back... or something like that. Great product....easy to use... have some issuesa saving mp3s to my SD card on my phone.....so I just save them like normal, then use a file manager app to move them where I actually want them sticking tongue out"
"11049","Amazon",2017-03-17,1,"This is a reminder... On how spoiled I was when I had my Google play music subscription. Amazon music just cannot compete with the real deal. Google Play also gets Youtube Red that alone is worth the price."
"11054","Amazon",2013-02-09,4,"I love listening to my music on here, and is easy to put on protable devices. I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also do not have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient."
"11055","Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"... music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to I listen to a LOT of music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to. And it is really great to have all this available on my desktop, laptop, tablet and phone! SIMPLY WONDERFUL! The recent updates to the music app make it easy to use. GOOD WORK AMAZON!"
"11057","Amazon",2017-01-01,5,"Five Stars very gooood! thank you Amazon music"
"11058","Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Not for me, even though free. Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks and albums. Just no way I am gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it is free for Prime members.Going back to Rhapsody."
"11061","Amazon",2014-10-19,2,"Not bad, but could be a lot better. A bit dissapointed with Amazon music, especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members, even if it was all included, it still wouldnt be that good, They are missing a lot of amazing artists, Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
"11063","Amazon",2017-03-31,1,"One Star This sucks!!! Getting no where trying to get this on my I phone !!!!"
"11066","Amazon",2014-10-13,2,"from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime. I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song."
"11068","Amazon",2017-07-01,1,"Use pandora instead This used to be a great app before they got money hungry. As it Prime member you used to be able to download a lot of music onto my phone and play it later to save data. But now they have updated it and I have to pay to be able to do that. They are taking way too many perks away from Prime members. Even their movie app is not as good as it was, So now I just use Pandora. If this keeps up I will drop my prime membership!"
"11072","Amazon",2012-12-07,1,"Amazon MP3 again we got this for my son to be able to get music on his android phone. we have yet to be able to get it to work. even though I have added his device to my account, downloaded the app on the device. it still says he is not authorized to use it."
"11074","Amazon",2011-03-31,1,"Doesnt play On DroidX running 2.2, most of my music tracks dont player, the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks...FOREVER. this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement. Those are my thoughts."
"11078","Amazon",2015-01-21,5,"Especially love her Christmas album I discovered Enya with this. Especially love her Christmas album, beautiful sounds! I have to load the albums or songs from ipad then they will play on the TV after I sync. Was a Godsend at Christmas! Kept the house peaceful with her voice! happy"
"11082","Amazon",2015-07-16,3,"sucker price I was disappointed on the Super Wednesday prime day when they advertised a fish finder for a low price, but when you opened it up it was more than 25 times the advertised price.Really gets your attention. .... but do not deliver."
"11089","Amazon",2011-05-18,3,"Just ok My greatest beef with Amazon player is how limited the settings are on the player itself. I love crossfading between tracks. Get this feature and I will make this my default player. Until then, not so much."

I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I am forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can not use it at all. I have uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I am supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can not stand this program."

"11710","Amazon",2014-01-06,1,"ALWAYS RUNNING!!! This app is a huge resource hog. It has a setting called refresh cloud library that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not. The setting does not give you the option to disable that check or even change the time interval. Hate apps that do not let you control if/when they run and drain your battery."
"11712","Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Getting better with age I have been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating. The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers. It is truly a great value added service."
"11713","Amazon",2016-06-16,1,"Not worth another subscription Did not care for the requirement to buy a separate subscription. We have Amazon Prime on my wife's phone and shared to my phone. I wanted to add music to my phone as I am the only driver and it would be nice to have our music to play from the phone through our car's enfotainment system. The attempted setup of a library for music required that I pay for another subscription. Definitely not worth another dollar 99. Cannot say how the service works. Unhappy"
"11714","Amazon",2014-11-30,1,"Worse than that Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.1. I expended over a dollar 100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesn’t allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, I’m in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I can’t delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.3. Same as number 2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I don’t like and I don’t know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.4. I can not play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a Exception number 180 codeIt is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour. That is why you hire software engineers and geeks. Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time."
"11715","Amazon",2016-05-11,1,"An Audiophile's Nightmare As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I am stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music. Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I am highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app does not work."
"11716","Amazon",2016-05-20,1,"Could use some editing I can not move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. it is pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it is a serious space hog and there just is not enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can not be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I will be more than happy to use it."
"11720","Amazon",2017-09-18,3,"App almost tolerable; Incompetent Music Unlimited Support Numerous issues with this app. Music not playing with errors, including music that I Own .

"11730","Amazon",2014-04-02,1,"Streaming works great. Downloading does not work at all. I have been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it so I can put it in the car, and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I am now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which should not even be necessary in the first place, would not be able to do its job. it is not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you will end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50 percent of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been 01. Track Name.mp3 would end up just being called 01. Track N , with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I am not paying for bandwidth.it is difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they will give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."
"11731","Amazon",2015-12-01,2,"Make the app self report errors... While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible. It fails repeatedly. It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service. Why does the app not send this report itself? Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again. Today I was just trying to edit a playlist. I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start. I do not want to call customer service. Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?"

"11738","Amazon",2016-11-15,3,"Not so good after the upgrade to new service Same old music, just different station names. Since the new update, it no longer connects to my Ford Sync, just bluetooth audio.

"11743","Amazon",2014-07-07,1,"Great concept, but essentially unusable in practice! I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the 2 day shipping and for the last year for streaming video. When the price jumped 25 percent , the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card purchased via Amazon Prime! installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the increased cost."
"11745","Amazon",2015-09-22,5,"Best app ever!!! I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it is crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it."
"11747","Amazon",2013-08-18,1,"No Download Location Setting Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."

I am no stranger to downloading music, I have been doing so since the Napster days.Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. it is bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me! . Wrong. it is genuinely terrible.Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history.

"11770","Amazon",2017-06-07,3,"Well behind Apple Music app. Hoping improvements will come soon! The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. it is not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices. It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no optionor a way for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try."

The error messages suggest I try again, but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I have PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that does not hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music will not play on any other player, that I have tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.

"11786","Amazon",2017-01-02,2,"... Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon ... The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the dollar 14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. was not getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I do not have a 3 month credit so we were not able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. Credits do not seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo were not worth their cost. would not recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I will be sticking with Pandora."

I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an Exit button available in it is menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an Exit button that shuts down the app.But this app? Nope!That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It took using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.And good riddance.If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I will reinstall it.Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw."

I have had to install a separate app just to put it into hibernation2 A bug seems to have been introduced recently where despite there being 70 songs in my playlist, the app insists on repeating the same song endlessly.

"11790","Amazon",2015-12-25,5,"The latest release of the best 50 Beatles hits is terrible because the sound engineers ... I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles' Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality, but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control. I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I do not understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault. Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV. Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities. I have also revised my star rating accordingly."
"11791","Amazon",2016-03-19,5,"Best music app I have ever used I do not understand how this app does not have all 5 star ratings. There is nothing it could possibly do better. I have stopped using Pandora altogether. Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it. The navigation is pretty simple and does not require re-thinking all the time. Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I have not seen anywhere else. Album art, great selection, the same stuff does not play over and over again, it is just great. Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora. I do not want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release! If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that is an issue.I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the number 1 music app in my opinion. I do not believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see. I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."
"11795","Amazon",2016-04-15,1,"Amazon Music - so far it is CRAP This Amazon Music software is crap. it is as if they shoved it out the door without ever testing it. Just to address the playlist aspect although there is plenty more that stinks. First I tried to import playlists from iTunes. It had the names of them OK and I checked all the boxes - but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music. Not the songs in the playlists, not the names of the playlists themselves. Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music. I could create them OK - but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes, it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked. Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I would check a song or two to add to a playlist - and the screen would inexplicably refresh, erasing my checkmarks, and re-setting to the beginning of the alpha list.Whoever they had developing this software, they should fire them. Whoever they had testing it, they should fire them. Oh, they should fire the designers, too. it is clunky and it does not work."

I am sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I am guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally.

I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose ho with where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can’t spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. It’s the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered.

"11809","Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"Again, Amazon willfully leaves committed customers in the cold I want to start with this: my dad has nominally enjoyed the use of his Kindle Fire. But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store. So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight. Sure, those 3rd parties are not pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that is probably because Amazon does not want to share.Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers. Not only does their weak app store show how they are catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."
"11810","Amazon",2014-08-02,1,"Downloading Purchases Is Slow and Painful I would been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new upgrade . I do not have Prime so I am not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old non-Prime version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. there is no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it was not easy weed out the duplicates.Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.UPDATE:Even worse than before. I am lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phoneDownload Failed. Error: 1000THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN"
"11811","Amazon",2016-10-08,1,"Should have left well alone, the 10/2016 upgrade is terrible I have used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right. The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however. No longer can you click on a song and select artist or album. You just have the option to play it. A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the recently added playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist. What is really egregious though is when you go to my music you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J. Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while. I feel like I am being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something. I prefer my own library and that is what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging."

In most instances, the listener never gets a good idea of the music because of the 30 seconds sample time. I often pass over songs that have a very limited sample of a song that I might otherwise buy. 30 seconds will give you an intro, or part of a verse, or perhaps part of a chorus or instrumental.

This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen novel concept. I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."
"11878","Amazon",2013-12-07,1,"Build 3.0.2 mistake. I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud. I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone. This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars. When you are listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the now playing list. This is no longer an option. Also, the reaction time when you do something, Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track... is significantly delayed.Time for a version rollback happy I wish.Another feature I just discovered: When you add an entire albums to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order. I do not really know if it is random, I did not qa test for randomness This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks."
"11882","Amazon",2017-04-28,1,"Not usable unless u live in US or Canada I am an international subscriber. I could not make use of my prime music nor videos. I could not even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad."
"11883","Amazon",2016-11-04,2,"Prime Unlimited Good Value, iPhone App just So So, Echo integration Poor I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think dollar 7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons - easy things to fix:1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it will not try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it does not even shuffle on the command Echo Shuffle My Music or Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account . On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say shuffle again and skip a song. Then it says enabling shuffle mode and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the dollar 25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to number 3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review."

I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me."

Loading songs is tricky do not like calling a concerto a song, seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references on a Windows computer, and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."

Maybe I am missing something, but it does not seem to have a great deal of music. When using any of the other apps I have mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they will have it. This thing does not even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it is going to get?! If this is it, I can not help wondering what its point is."

If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
"11917","Amazon",2016-08-20,3,"I like the variety I like the variety, but their analytics suck. I like listening to instrumental music while studying, but I get tired of only classical. So I choose other artists like piano guys, and I do not want to keep saying I do not like the same music on that channel over and over again. I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!"

It has high quality music and I really love that you can even read the lyrics and sing-along with the song of your choice! it is very convenient for me since I do not need to go online and search for the lyrics of the song! My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song, it is not the right one. So I have to go and look for the albums one by one. it is a hassle for me. Hope they will fix this though."

"11929","Amazon",2014-03-25,1,"App does not store MP3s on External SD like other services puts songs in wrong order, splits albums up and corrupts track names 1. The Amazon MP number player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.2. The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish looking item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_disc_1_02_-_you are_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player, and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we will not let you store the music on external storage.3. I have over 11,000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. There are many albums produces in a certain order and Amazon screws this up - been like this for years. Never fix it3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album so and so and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google, Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep 3rd parties and the music industry out of it."

In addition to causing my phone to choke into freeze mode, the app is not easy to use. Furthermore, it will not let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which is not why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I would use it.

Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda... undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind.... then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of downloadable songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you are from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free with pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your aol.com email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device... its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices"

My search bar does not work, it pulls up nothing, so I have been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music see my complaint about scrolling. Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music is not where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers. I can not click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett and the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there does not seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can not fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app."

There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory not the memory card, as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone. Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app."
"11979","Amazon",2016-02-21,2,"Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work everytime. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I am wrong. My husband has already declared it sucks! . But I do not listen as often and I have more mainstream tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I do not like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it is essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I would rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain will not recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are re-recorded versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I have not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. what is the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song good luck if you can find it on Prime Music . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."

Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit was not uploaded, do not own a copy.

As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I have been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It will not load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains running when it does not even work.The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things do not improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."

Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference, but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC, it would not install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use. Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations when I can see them!."

I never even finished installing this bit of spyware, there is no reason they need access to my browser history or my bookmarks. I pay enough for prime and my music that Amazon does not need to be trying to make money from my private info, too. If they ever trim the list down to the things they actually need, I may try again. But as we all know, big companies do not care at all about our privacy or the fact that we are human beings, not consumers , so that will not happen. If you love the idea of this company keeping track of every little thing you do, then go ahead and install it! Since I cannot use music purchased through Amazon the way I wish, I really need to rethink where I am spending my money. Very disappointed in Amazon as a whole, my privacy matters."
"11995","Amazon",2012-12-13,5,"Great MP3 music player I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily. It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player. Easy interface to use and browse your music.My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there is not one on the original album. I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence! and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause. Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well. Try listening to Wagner: The Ring Without Words and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts. I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review. Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other. I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."

Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I am in the mood for, or a band I like, and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car, in the office, and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I have tried Milk music, Pandora, and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best."
"12002","Amazon",2011-05-03,2,"Removed after Cloud Limits Enacted I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second hit the home key or switch tasks I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I many times have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now especially for Amazon, who does not have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song and there are so many competitors Google Play Music, for instance I can not justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs which took almost a day! then deleted. you have lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."
"12003","Amazon",2013-02-14,2,"No ability to save to external SD card I hate to downrate the app to two stars. Overall, the app is a nice player. Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones Galaxy3internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music. The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone. At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD which breaks playlists.If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars."
"12004","Amazon",2017-04-09,1,"Effectively nonfunctional Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I have moved back to iTunes. Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead."
"12012","Amazon",2015-08-12,4,"Good service, but... I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes, but I think maybe I need to use it more.

Otherwise in an are where I have internet, the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good."
"12013","Amazon",2016-02-09,1,"Just stay away from this expensive data and battery hog. First: This works fine on my computer, and I like it.Second, there is a very big but : not only was it gobbling half my battery life with the phone app - all while not being used - that it does not do what it must do if it is a phone app. Namely, work on my wifi. I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I would used 1GB of data that I did not even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I have used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I would be paying now.Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it there is no off button and you can not get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise, and now it is got a pop up asking me to log in that you can not get out of by pressing the back button. Amazon can forget it. I am not logging in and out when I want to play music."

Are you completely unaware that we can already stream music for free elsewhere without a subscription of any kind? Stored on a cloud simply means we control all of your access to music you purchased . I am not going to renew our Prime subscription next year. So far our is just a gateway to additional monthly fees."

Took two attempts and at least a half hour to get a movie to play. Last time I tried to watch a movie it was telling me I couldnt watch it in HD, not enough bandwidth I have 60 meg bandwidth router 10 ft from TV. Those services are terrible. Amazon.

Throughout the day, I know that no matter what I am planning on doing, there is music that fits, whether Ska, Classic, Rock, Pop, Country, everything in one place. I have had different online music programs, some I pay for, some free, and this one is the very best that I have come across.I can listen across all my devices without having to make a new playlist each and every time just by signing into my account."

With this app, however, those buttons are ghosted over so you can not open the app even if you wanted to.No luck finding it in the applications folder either..I am so disappointed because I have so much music hosted on Amazon, but can not even get it to play when i really need it to."

I will continue to check it out. Best of all there seems to be a random button for all songs in your library without creating a playlist.

I generally list items by Album. Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I am done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....2 Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can not just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem number 1 above. I am guessing Amazon would respond that there is something in the metadata that does not flag it as a comp, but come on. If I am in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."
"12059","Amazon",2016-06-21,1,"Underwhelmed by Amazon Amazon allowed me to purchase additional upload space for 250k songs, I uploaded about 20k. They can not provide a good user experience with this many songs. Looks like I will have to cancel and find another service. One good example is that I can consistently try to download an album i uploaded and every time it crashes the app. It is constantly laggy and trying to update even though there are no updates to my music library. It often hangs or crashes for unknown reasons. Amazing that one of the largest tech compaines in the world can not build and app that is not more stable than this."

I am totally regretting downloading this update and am considering looking online to see if anyone has the old version so I can go back. PLEASE AMAZON, FIX THIS!UPDATE 12-12-13: There was an update that fixed a few minor issues but still did not bring back the lock screen controls. And now, when using the Amazon mp3 app, some of my songs cut off half-way through for no reason. Really frustrating. I have now migrated over to GoneMAD Music Player. It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old working version of Amazon mp3, but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call. It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless. let us be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service. And I understand that and was OK with it. I will use your store...just give me an app that has some halfway decent features and works and we are good. You had that, but now the app is bunk.

I do not care if my music downloads to my device, I can move that to my SD, no problem. However, now if I want to pause my music while I am driving, I have to look at my phone, and I do not like doing that.

Pick a genre and play music. No stupid play list. The android app still lacks artist search in the station area.I have tried to like Amazon Prime Music streaming service. This is my second time since its original release. But it just lacks common sense features that other streaming services provide.Pro: One very nice feature that stands out above the others is Amazon’s x-ray. Lyrics display during a song.Con: Amazon Prime is hard to use. Everything is centered on either an Artist or a Play-List. Where others like Pandora, Spotify, and etc have something called a Station. A station is similar genre music.Search for an Artist in Amazon, you get a list of Singles and Albums for that Artist. Now what? Play one song and search again? I personally never want to listen to more than one song of a given Artist. I want Random.You can make your own Play Lists. But that is just too completed to listen to random music of a genre. You can select a preexisting Play List. There are some nice preexisting lists. But after x songs are done, and then you have to select another list.Pandora is still the simplest to use."

I see that message so often, that I just do not even bother. My cache is clear, my computer is up-to-date. Tiresome. 3. Because of problem number 1, I thought I would open a SECOND cloud to split my library. Wellllllll... Now it tells me that my computer can only be associated with ONE cloud account. This is just my experience with the PC version. It works well with Roku, except that I do not get prime. It works okay with the Fire, but the interface with either is somewhat clunky for a large library. I am phasing out not only using this app, but purchasing digital music from Amazon."
"12173","Amazon",2017-04-19,3,"Too cumbersome of an App. Takes up too much space in phone storage and uses up too much RaAM, cannot be shut down nor turned off neither. Kept crashing my phone even when it was not in use. Only thing good is that some music comes free with the App."

The NEXT day, my phone was unable to open the pre-installed app without getting the following dialog box: Amazon Music app has crashed. I tried to uninstall not able to without jeopardizing other apps. I even tried going into the Amazon App store to download again, with same results. Very disappointed if this app will not work on my new phone and also just realized it will not work on my 2nd generation Kindle Fire."
"12178","Amazon",2014-06-12,1,"Is there a way....... to give no stars.....this is such a poor app. I am really disappointed that Amazon would put out such a pathetic app. It simply does not work,and to top it off, it opens itself to portrait view, and there is no choice for landscape view,what the hell."

I have no idea why Amazon does not let me share digital content with my wife the way they do with prime shopping.I would be Amazon all the way for movies, music, audio books, etc if this were true. But I am not paying another dollar 100 for my own prime account and having all my digital content segregated from my wife's account."
"12195","Amazon",2016-05-27,4,"Prime music has better radio and lists than Spotify IMO Prime music has better lists than Spotify and radio stations. I haven't experienced a repeated song in the radio stations, and new cool stations are suggested very often using the power of math. that is nice. The only issue is that I think that the library is not as huge as spotify which may be a problem if you look for specific songs very often."
"12202","Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"quite buggy I was looking for a cloud/PC app that would allow me to ditch GooglePlay's music app on my PC and android phone Samsung Note3 is what I presently have. GooglePlay will allow you to upload your entire library from your PC, either iTunes, Windows Media player, etc. Its pretty good, all the songs uploaded and you can create playlists and download those playlists to whatever device you are using.Amazon's does that, pretty much. However, not all songs uploaded. I tried rescanning and rescanning, and ever time it finds a few more songs to upload. One album of mine in particular it absolutely refuses to upload. Nothing is wrong with the format, or any of the locations I tried moving the songs to in order to try an upload... just tells me there is not anything new in the folders to upload. And no, they are not in the amazon library at all with me just missing them. I checked the entire darn thing.Also, it uploaded quite a few songs multiple times. Some songs will not play all the way through. I can not seem to find a way to move an entire playlist to my device instead of just streaming the music using my data that I am limited on. Since I do not have a wifi connection at work, this is pretty much useless for me.I like that I can use amazon prime music and get a lot of songs free, but since I can not get the app to work on my computer anyway tried many times, and I am tech savvy enough to be able to do that kind of thing Amazon music is not for me just yet. Amazon, I hope you can fix these items, you are so close! happy"
"12205","Amazon",2017-02-23,1,"For Roku App This is a review for the Amazon Music App for the Roku. I will preface this by saying I have a Fire TV, And a Fire stick, yet My Roku Stick's app will not let me stream Amazon Prime Music unless I own it. Why is the app features not the same across the board? Amazon has always claimed they did not make a lot of money on the hardware but it was a way to entice people into joining Amazon Prime. I probably should not be venting on this site but maybe someone will listen. I still like Amazon Prime but there are some chinks in the armor. It will be interesting to see some of the decisions they make in the near future."

Why is it that I have to add a song to the cloud in order to make a separate playlist. That very feature will cause accumulation of different music types. Also the lack of music choice feels significantly limited. Change the layout too it is just so boring and unorganized. Also add dates of albums to know what is new and maybe popularity LEVELS of music. there is potential but there a lot to work on. One thing I do like is the lyrics. But please look at your rivals and actually compete.-iPhone 6s user-"

Sometimes I listen to music by album, sometimes by artist and sometimes I just play the songs in alphabetical order. I haven't had time to watch the free movies yet but I have checked through the titles and there is plenty that I would like to watch.

"12233","Amazon",2017-07-18,1,"and really like the music I have used this app for over a year, and really like the music. HOWEVER, the last couple months I have been getting warnings about data usage from Verizon. Every time I look for what is using data, I find that this app player is open and running. I keep turning it off and it keeps turning the player back on in the background. After removing the app, reinstalling it and removing it again, I have discovered that it was the reason my battery life is lousy. Something in this app has started to run in the background, chew through battery and result in data charges.I used to really like this app and listened regularly for quite some time. it is only the last 2 months that something in this app has been causing an issue. In back to back testing with the app installed, then uninstalled not using it at all, I went from having roughly 30 percent battery left at 5PM versus 70 percent battery left at 5PM. Reinstalled the app, was back to 50 percent battery by noon yesterday, then removed the app. Today I have 86 percent battery left at 1:30 PM. The power figures I quoted are WITHOUT EVEN RUNNING THE APP. If I used it, I had to recharge my phone before 4PM. The phone was also always warm with the app installed, which is a sure sign of power usage.I would say that is pretty definitive. There is something running in the background that cannot be turned off. It was eating my battery and eating my data. It did not do it until the last couple months, so they have changed something in the app. that is causing the issue. I removed it from my phone and the phone is back to normal. I will miss it as I used to use it regularly. But, I do not like being spied on."

Given my past experience with Amazon, I was greatly dissatisfied upon listening to the albums because they are 256kbps and I was expecting, if not lossless FLAC, then at least full-320kbps.It may not be much of a difference, but as a fan of this music, I am VERY disappointed on principle alone and would love a refund of these four dollar 8.99 albums.

To me I see this app as the corporate version of napster. They would love to share their music with you and give it to you in an unlimited amount of empty files and constant commercials selling you something every other second from every direction in the form of music track and albums for sale. As well as other apps and other membership services. Basically it is a rent to own type deal letting you download certain tracks to your device without giving you full access to files and always giving the option to buy. .... rent it as long as you like you never own anything unless you purchase it. You can not download to other devices aside form the device the app is installed in. The files being only accessible via the app so when your no longer a member there is no longer music it would seem. hmmm... something to think about."

We analyzed my phone and their network to see what the problem was. It was Amazon Music. I downloaded the app about a month ago and looked at it once. The app ran up 3.6GB of data usage in the background for what I haven't a clue without me ever hearing a note. This app appears to be dangerous. I uninstalled because you can not trust that it is not pulling data from Amazon servers. have no issues with Google Play. Luckily Verizon understood since I only use about .5GB a month and this app pulled 3.6GB for no apparent reason."
"12263","Amazon",2014-06-29,3,"Decent app, subpar widget and notifications As a prime subscriber, I was pleased to have this additional service added. I do not enjoy making playlists, and I always opt to use premade or instant playlists. Amazon offers playlists that cater to my tastes, and which include some songs I like that I do not otherwise have in my library. In that respect, I really like what Amazon has brought to the table. That said, I do have a few issues with the app. Streaming on my PC is perfectly fine, but the streaming playback on my Android phone is always choppy at the beginning of each song. My LTE coverage is perfectly good, and Google Play has never had trouble streaming on my phone. My second issue with the app is that it wipes out the active playlist after a few hours of being paused. I want to get out of work and just push play and pick up where I left off. I do not want to have to find that playlist again and figure out where I was. The last issue I have is that the notification tray play button does not work for me. This might have to do with the fact that my playback is always paused via unplugging an auxiliary audio cable, but the play button should work regardless. I do not have too much to say about the fullscreen app itself, as I only use it to pick my playlist."

Note all my products are brand new so it is the app. Also this app is not setup for roku at this time.

I have attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful.

I am loving the curated playlists and the music that is on them. In general there is a great selection of music in Prime.One piece of feedback... I can not do much more to interact with the playlists than rate a playlist overall. I listen to the playlists when I am at work and have been finding that there are times where I am liking the music so much I want to like or give some sort of feedback live. I have been using Periscope a lot lately and have been the digging the ability to tap little hearts during the live broadcasts. That would be pretty cool to do when I am listening to Amazon Prime music and you could get more feedback on how people are liking the jams.Keep up the good stuff!

I can listen to any of my music I downloaded from Amazon without downloading the tracks to my phone. All my music is right where I can easily access it.

I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit. Then came the support merry-go-round. My first rep was difficult for me to understand, very slow to understand me and did not seem knowledgeable which was understandable since he was in Africa. After getting an American rep, I was no more successful. I have received two, not one email welcoming me to Amazon Music, so I guess I had registered but still no clarity on the error message. i QUIT.

In particular, I would like to be able to search for music by duration, as I like to find DJ mix's often included on dance compilations. This is easy to do on soundcloud, but not on prime music. And , as mentioned before, I would really like to search for music via my fire tv box, and listen to it on my TV / sound system in my living room.

"12307","Amazon",2015-06-02,1,"0 Stars should be an option It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song, meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST, so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away, so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as Free music. I never thought I could dislike a music service more than Pandora... but this takes the poo cake."

Songs is in quotes, because most of my collection is classical, so a song could be less than a minute, to over 30 minutes in a symphony movement.It took FOREVER well, 5 days to download all this to the cloud, as the computer kept going to sleep if not monitored, but it went smoothly, and now I do not have to also carry my iPod with me on trips. I also liked the fact that Amazon bumps the bps from the 192 max on Apple, to 256. With a good pair of headphones you can hear the difference.I also REALLY liked the fact that Amazon gives you the album art, unlike Apple, which nickels-and-dimes you for everything dollar 1 for album art?

"12374","Amazon",2015-07-25,1,"Great service? WTF! I have been a prime member since the service started...the Prime music sounds great... that seems to be where the great stops...added a few playlists, then tried to find the playlists... a list of crap and nowhere to be seen are the playlists that I added.click on Your Music Library > takes me to.... nowhere!Oh, wait! It only works on my PHONE! not on the computer, not on the Sonos unit I purchased fromAmazon.... Crap!Hey guys, when you make it work with more of the devices I actually use, let me know. It may even make it move to 2 stars!I love Amazon Prime, but as it stands this 'service' holds almost '0' value for me."
"12384","Amazon",2017-06-23,3,"Does Amazon Prime hide the good Music in Amazon Music Unlimited? Great music, but I find the lack of many artists' music discouraging unless I PAY more by adding Amazon Music Unlimited.And, you can not click on the notice to add AMU either....seems they would make it easy to buy it.I can use Google Play for free if I put up with an add every 5 or 6 songs...short ads too."
"12386","Amazon",2017-05-08,3,"Would expect more Not all music is accesible. Have to pay again for music not available under Prime. Woukd expect more after paying for prime"
"12387","Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Amazon Music with Prime is amazing! This has to be one of the best music programs I have ever had the pleasure of using. It is very easy to operate and pretty much self explanatory. Searching for music and downloading it is a breeze, and you also have the option of placing tracks in your Amazon cloud. With this feature you are able to access your music from anywhere without necessarily having to use up needed space on your device. The best feature I have found is that the music library. It is so extensive that u can find just about anything that you can imagine, and if you have a Prime membership, most if them are free. it is awesome...I will almost certainly never have to look anywhere else for my music needs."
"12390","Amazon",2015-10-11,1,"Too complicated Prime music is too complicated.can not figure out how to make it work.I do not want to add to my library - not interested.Just want search - get a list, say play and listen for 3 hours.Plus how much javascript do we need to allow from 3rd parties for this to work? I am careful to NOT allow 3rd party javascript - what is this cloudfront place? A hacker website? Has amazon been hacked?Lastly, I would love to use prime music with our roku, so security issues are not my problem.Someday I hope to be smart enough to get this working on my Ubuntu Linux desktop - ah ... someday."
"12398","Amazon",2017-04-22,1,"New update is the worst I just got prime again and now all the songs I downloaded are gone and it wont even let me browse without the music membership which is expensive. I used to love this app, when I had any semblance of selection."
"12405","Amazon",2016-08-21,1,"New Update caused app to CRASH...disgusted I would give no stars if I could!!! I have been using the app to play music on my iphone and it was working great UNTIL the new update. Now I can not get the app to open on my phone, and all of my music is on there. Hopefully there is an easy solution to the problem but thus far have had no help in getting any advise!!! I am totally disgusted!!"
"12407","Amazon",2017-02-02,1,"does not work. Exception number 117, NO FIX IN SIGHT can not even access the app. I receive an exception number 117 error. I called customer service weeks ago to resolve it to no avail. They said they are moving it up the chain and will contact me to fix it. Still has not been resolved. I am a prime member and this app is a big reason I am a prime member and I can not even use it. I should not even have to be paying for Prime if I can not use it is features.Not sure what they did, the app used to work for me awhile back."
"12411","Amazon",2016-09-12,2,"which was cool since this app is not that great So, I purchase music through Amazon. There were a few albums I bought and downloaded and they became available in my default music application on android, which was cool since this app is not that great. But anything I purchased and downloaded after was only available to play in the Amazon app, which was disappointing because I purchased the music, let me play it in whatever app I please. This app runs like garbage and if you are not online, listening to music you downloaded can still be a struggle."
"12413","Amazon",2017-01-09,4,"I gave it 4 stars only because I only gave it 4 because there is not an option to close this app without signing all the way out of the app. I hate to have to put in my email and then my password every time I open the app. I like in the Iheart app you can close the app but you do not have to put in all your info when you open the app again so I listen to it more than the Amazon Music App."
"12414","Amazon",2015-06-09,1,"Wanted to love it. I wanted to like this app. I liked being able to download music to my phone that I got through amazon prime for free. I was also able to import my music from my SD Card into it and create playlists. Great. The app seemed to perform well, however it DRAINS BATTERY like no other in the background. I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large percent of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I do not need to force close, Amazon? For the record I only ever listed to music that was local to my device. Never streamed music."
"12416","Amazon",2017-06-26,3,"Duplicate Songs in Amazon Music Playlists Its not bad. Good selection of music to pick from. However the biggest problem is duplicate songs. When you click to add a song to your playlist, it does not notify you if the song is already there, it just adds it therefore duplicates add up. Spotify would notify you that the song was already added to your playlist. They really need to look into fixing this issue, seems like a simple fix to just prompt you before adding."
"12418","Amazon",2016-10-06,5,"This works! I like it, especially as an alternative to itunes.It took me a while but I finally migrated all my apple music over.Now I can listen to my cloud library or prime music in the car with very little data usage."
"12422","Amazon",2013-08-08,4,"Nice App, needs more capability I have had this app for a few months now. I do enjoy using it to play music. I never was too pleased with iTunes, this is a bit better IMHO.I have about 7,600 songs in my library. I have downloaded about half to my phone. When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs. This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application. For example - if you are playing a song, you can not add it to a playlist from that point."
"12423","Amazon",2015-03-29,5,"Best value as of 3/29/15 and now virtually UNLIMITED Secure, fast biderectional cloud storage via good usser interfaces. A solid Cloud service, great value - especially now that annual price for Unlimited storage is under dollar 60! The caution I have is that - with large music libraries, up and downloads take significant time - even on very high speed connections I have Verizon FIOS 50MBS bidirectional and Gigabit WiFi.It is best to clean all your files and ensure correct MP3 tags are in place BEFORE you upload - otherwise, the service automatically modifies tags while upgrading the music file quality. I found this especially true for audio books in MP3 format - in particular.This is an outstanding value and it makes your music available to any of your Windows, Android, iPad or similar devices. thanks !!!"
"12426","Amazon",2016-10-14,5,"Very Happy with Amazon Music! I have been using Amazon Music online and the PC app for sometime since I was able to upload all my MP3s I own. Lately I have been adding more Prime songs which has been great. I am also very happy with the new update to the Android App, it is great. The Android App sound quality is really good, especially with my Sony Bluetooth Headphones. One of the best features is the ability to download Prime songs to your phone or SD Card, this has expanded my offline library by a ton."
"12432","Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"I just want to download music simply and easily. I find this app confusing. It does not seem to work correctly. It does not always open on my laptop. it is hard to find recently added music. I also think amazon has made it more difficult to easily add music to itunes. Often duplicate files download, and I can not seem to keep that from happening. I am not a novice digital music buyer or user. I have been buying my music from amazon for about 10 years. Every time they update a music app, it is buggy and bulky."

Now I remember why I did not use it before, even though I bought some music from Amazon...it really is quite intrusive and resource intense.Also I was sad to see that Amazon apparently does not support Prime Music as well as Prime Video on my Nexus Player !Uninstalling. Amazon can keep the money I spent before on music. I am sticking with my Google Play Music subscription."

"12449","Amazon",2013-02-01,5,"A great app that I use every day I cheered when Amazon started selling MP3 music a few years ago. It was time for Apple's iTunes to get some serious competition, and Amazon's MP3 store has done that. With the MP3 app being integrated with the Amazon Cloud, it is now easy to purchase or play my music from my Android phone and tablet."

"12459","Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"Forces Portrait I love the new Prime Music and having expanded access to A LOT more music! Makes Prime that much more worth it. This app is great on a phone, however it forces Portrait on a tab. This is fine if you have a 7-8 inch tab, but with a 10 inch tab, it is kinda annoying. We need a Landscape view for us tablet users, please."
"12461","Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"Awesome music app This is an awesome app. I use it all the time when I am at the gym and love the different music that is available to download."
"12464","Amazon",2016-11-07,2,"So far it is got nothing on Spotify Super hard to use. Confusing setup. Worst of all it takes forever to individually select songs to move to playlists once downloaded. Song selection still lacking."
"12465","Amazon",2016-02-01,1,"I love you for a lot of things but no longer ... Buy music from Amazon and then try and use the Prime music to download it and place on SD card, or into libraray and you willend up wishing you had not bought the music from them in the first place.Its the most user unfriendly site imaginable.I am not buying any music on the site till it changes and starts to make things understandable, instead of just busting themselves to make sure you use and contribute to there Prime site.Sorry Amazon, I love you for a lot of things but no longer your music sites."
"12473","Amazon",2015-02-23,2,"Very dissatisfied I jumped in with both feet with this app and decided I was going to love it..Prime music, the cloud storage....I really tried to give it my all. Calling it a resource hog is polite. My Galaxy S4 with 16GB of internal and 32GB of external was no match. If you have any kind of a music library say goodbye to your internal memory. I love the prime music but it is worthless when you can not use it. Amazon does so many things well...whoever approved this app can not be much of a music lover.....or they are a former iTunes programmer. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it would almost be easier to rip music and use media player. Very frustratied and disappointed."
"12474","Amazon",2017-09-04,5,"5 stars for Amazon Prime Music! I am truly enjoying Prime Music. The variety of available artists, albums, genres and songs is very entertaining for me. And, a great break from my huge jukebox of digital music. I would recommend this Amazon streaming service to anybody I know. I have done just that, with great response."
"12480","Amazon",2016-10-14,1,"Temporarily? Ruined by a recent update A recent update turned this app into a constantly crashing disaster on PC. what is worse is that Amazon is not really communicating about the issue as of the time I posted this review. I would avoid using this app at all costs until the problem is solved.it is a shame, given that I would have previously rated this app as a four-star app: I was genuinely happy with it before. Of course, that was back when it was still functioning."
"12482","Amazon",2016-11-10,1,"The new app sucks. It is buggy and slow The new app sucks. It is buggy and slow. It is so interactive to the point of being annoying. Not very easy to use."
"12490","Amazon",2014-06-20,2,"do not have a thing if it am not got that swing App is splashy, but had to be authorized from a computer, which is silly. Signing up on your computer was just a method for driving hits to the site for popularity. Problem was that it was not intuitive in navigation and therefore irksome. The app looks fine, feels fine, but overall is veneer over cheap wood. it is a bit clunky and goes for jukebox vintagey feel over function. The app got locked up on trying to upload my music from my ipad. No option to bypass, only sit there and wait. Felt like a Microsoft product at Walmart. I have purchased music and films at Amazon, but no cross-refencing to create suggestions or no ability for you to read a spotify playlist or even take a suggestion from the getgo. This is clearly a rush job by an asynchronous team who had to take a shelved product to market after it finally passed through legal or something that held it up.So its available, but not fun to use. Perhaps it will be fixed, but for now, luckily, there are other apps that sing and play. This one will have to stay in from recess."

The playlist suck at least for the artist I was looking for. After reading the other reviews I am glad I did not get to far with it. I do not want having control of my phone or anything else.There are plenty of other places to get my music without the aggravation this app puts you through. No thanks!"
"12494","Amazon",2011-04-20,4,"a great addition to android. I am running amazon mp3 on a nexus S. this app is great. cloud player works very well and sounds excellent. only issue I have had is with some buffering which seems to take forever but mobile reception is always a bit of a gamble. if I am in a 3g area with full bars Cloud Player just works.I wish I could upload directly from my phone but that is my only gripe with the app. all the people complaining about how it does not work with their phone need to really assess the criteria that they buy phones with. get stock Android whenever possible."
"12498","Amazon",2013-05-20,1,"data usage was bad I only used it to download 6 songs and 1 album. Then I played two tracks and the data usage was over 500 MB. The other app Google? registered very little. I guess this app would be okay when used at home or at a public wifi but I am usually on the road. I am an avid fan of Amazon 4 kindle purchases, Amazon Prime and the bulk of my online purchases come via Amazon but of this app? Not so much."
"12502","Amazon",2017-06-12,5,"Easy-Peasy! What a great app; free music and streamlined, easy-to-use menus are quick to navigate, and get you what you need."

"12505","Amazon",2011-09-05,5,"I bought an HTC Android device for this reason I thought it was neat when it came out. But I only had a stupid phone not a smart phone . I was not eligible to get a smart phone until Oct 2010. It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive. Just go get on amazon...sweet! However, I wanted one of those smart phones. I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed. However, waiting gets the best of us. I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet. I thought the 7 display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you. And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT. It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I did not. This way I get what I wanted android stuff and I did not have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I am in the middle of dishes and I can not get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it is available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier. I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems. No searching this folder or that. I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I did not like was that for some reason I can not figure out how to not download a whole album...but that does not take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player happy If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak winking"
"12511","Amazon",2014-06-23,5,"Love, love, love this!! I have enjoyed Amazon Prime benefits for years and when Prime Music was added, I was thrilled! I was very impressed with the different types of music offered. My phone and tablet are full now. To me, just the music is worth joining Prime! you will find music for everyone in your family!"
"12513","Amazon",2015-03-18,1,"Screwed So today I bought an album that I already owned while listening to it. Then contacting support who simply said that you can not return digital music. I told them I already have the album, along with 20,000 other songs. So on each one I can pick up my phone and accidentally buy it if I am not careful. Also, no way to turn off one-click ordering? So I am deleting and moving my music. I seriously spend so much money on Amazon, being blatantly screwed really makes me want to take ALL of my business elsewhere. It is almost like I am sad that they can not just be better and have common sense. can not they add a ARE YOU SURE button..."

SD functionality please?!?!If I constantly had access to wifi or 4g internet I d be totally fine with you using the cloud all the time..."
"12515","Amazon",2016-12-08,2,"Frustrating - Interface is needlessly confusing and difficult This app is very challenging to use. First, while it is intuitive to search, once you have music picked you want to listen to, it is difficult to find it once again. Amazon programmers, I would invite you to take a look at the Spotify interface. Right now on Amazon music, I can neither find playlists or albums I have listened to previously. I have largely given up because it is so complicated to navigate."
"12516","Amazon",2016-06-04,1,"Was a decent app. All of a sudden I can only play 500 songs on shuffle. I have 4100 songs that I normally shuffle.I listen to my music in my vehicle and at work.It was shuffling fine on my old phone, but the new phone running Android Marshmallow seems to have a different version of the app."
"12517","Amazon",2015-12-27,5,"Excellent Prime Membership feature! I love being to create my own music lists as well as listening to already programmed ones. I listen to this everyday with my phone on my commute from the East-East Bay to San Francisco on BART 55min if no delays. I have Verizon and only lose connectivity occasionally through the trans-bay tube and Caldecott tunnel. Nice feature of Prime Membership!"
"12519","Amazon",2012-09-12,2,"Unable to save music to SD Card The inability of this app to save downloaded music to my external SD card earns it a two star deduction. that is kinda the whole point of me getting an SD card. I have awful signal at work, so I can not use streaming, and the SD card issue really limits the amount of music I can download to my device. I really like most of the rest of the app, but that simple limitation makes it really hard to love the app in total."
"12520","Amazon",2012-08-09,1,"Can NOT dowload the music I bought onto my external SD card! I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 on Verizon. The app can ONLY download to the phone's memory same with my Motorola Droid X, and NOT my external micro SDHC card where I, like many, store MUSIC/pictures/videos. The music tracks are like 7MB each. And do not blab to me about the Cloud Drive. While that sounds great in theory, with only Sprint keeping unlimited data plans available I just lost mine in this last phone upgrade, streaming music all the time is not gonna cut it. I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP. Ugghhhh...... Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
"12527","Amazon",2012-09-30,2,"Not ver functional The app plays music fine and is easy to purchase music with, but it is not very good other than that.Be warned that you cannot set the app to download music to an SD card, you have to use the internal memory. Also, you cannot create a playlist on your device and sync it to the cloud."
"12531","Amazon",2016-01-29,3,"Great app, but does not support Chromecast Audio This was my go-to music app - it is got a great interface, and I like how easy it is to find, purchase, and seamlessly integrate new music into my library. However, I recently added Chromecast Audio throughout my house, and Amazon for some reason refuses to support it. When I use the Amazon app, I am stuck using a single stereo in my house, and that is not good enough for me. So, Amazon, get over yourself and play in the sandbox with Google on this, and I will reconsider my switch to Spotify."
"12539","Amazon",2012-12-12,1,"Would be great, but for non-configurable storage location Only one star as there is currently no way to configure where the app stores downloaded music. On my Samsung Galaxy S3 it ends up on the internal sdcard, taking up valuable storage space required for apps. So after downloading the music using the app, I have to manually copy the files to my external 64GB sdcard. Talk about usability... To me this makes the whole player as such a waste of time.What point is an integrated player/downloader if an additional manual step is required every time I want to store the music locally? The cloud feature is great when listening on the desktop but with the phone I often listen to music when there is no stable or only a very slow internet connection e.g. when on a plane or long-distance train.So only one instead of 4 or 5 stars, as the software as such is not usable right now. Just download the files via the desktop, copy them over to the phone's external sdcard and use the built-in mp3 player. Much better user experience and less hassle!"

Why would you ever buy Amazon when Google Play is FREE for a max of 50,000 songs?3.

To top if off 2 of the last three downloads that are on the cloud and with help from amazon are on my computer. One of the songs was upcut and the other had so many pops and clicks in it I deemed it worthless. With so many professional noise reduction progrms available to the people supplying amazon digital services with product there is no excuse for poor mastering. By the way Amazon did refund my money."

So I am giving the neutral ratting of 3. However, the cloud storage works great! I will upgrade to 5 stars should this app be updated to do this. You are welcome to leave a comment to my review should you know of on which does this.Background info of what I am looking for:My Chinese lessons mp3 files have Chinese phonetic, English translation, and Chinese characters along with the audio. This makes them very useful to learn the foreign language. The size of my Kindle Fire is perfect for studding my lessons. However, the KF MP3 player and this app does not do this.To enable this feature for Windows Media Player, to the following:Right click screen on WMP, mouse over pop up menu Lyrics captions subtitles , click On if available To enable this feature on an iPod Touch MP3 player may be the same for iPhone and iPad, do the following:Settings->Music->Lyrics and Podcast Info - ON"

"12591","Amazon",2014-03-05,2,"I want to love it! But Amazon will not let me! I have bought most of my downloadable music from Amazon. I am content to store my music with Amazon. But this dang player has a couple of serious flaws. Foremost is the fact that I can not store my music on my external SD card. WTH Amazon? I see comments on this function going back for years and you still haven't added it? Are you figuring we will all just stream? Do we all look like we have got unlimited data plans? Let me store my music on my external card! At this moment, I am uploading my music to Google to give them a spin.If I go with them for storage and playback, guess where I will be buying my music?Not asking for much here...As Beth Hart sings so incredibly well, Get your s*** together. "
"12595","Amazon",2014-08-21,1,"Mysterious data hog! Hey Amazon, WTF?!? My fully charged phone becomes critically low on battery in about eight hrs. It usually lasts me two days. I investigate and find that even though I haven't even opened it today, this app used 667 MB!!! I haven't used the app at all in several days - and I have no songs downloaded in the app at all. I can understand some minor data transfer - I am sure I am paying with some form of information - but using hundreds of MB of my data plan in a few hours without my knowledge or involvement? And using cellular data even though I have the only use wi-fi checked in the settings? Very NOT Cool!"
"12596","Amazon",2014-05-23,2,"Good But Major Flaw on iPhone OK, I have the fully paid up version, some 40,000 songs stored on Amazon servers! The problem occurs when I am streaming on the move unlimited data and I lose signal on the phone. It shows a 'Cloud Player Error' then you can click 'OK' or 'Contact Us'. If you click OK you may get another error, unless signal is back again. If I am driving I just want it to work again so will not stop, press the contact button and write a message! Why does not it play from a cache, built up during times of good signal, or just pause until I get a signal back? I do not want to have to stop when I get a signal and push the button on my phone! Please, please, please, fix it Amazon!"
"12599","Amazon",2012-07-26,3,"Good app overall, Need support for download destination changes I have been a long time user of the amazonmp3 app. It works very well for my needs. I can quickly access cloud content, purchase music, download it to my phone, play from the cloud, etc.I need to be able to specify a different download directory. The app will not allow me to. When I attempt to move the content from one location to another the playlist duplicates every individual track. One references the old location where the file no longer exists and the other references the new location where the file currently exists and can be played normally. I contacted support and they were unable to resolve this problem for me. Their best suggestion was to manually go through and delete out the old tracks, one by one. For anyone with more than just a couple of mp3s downloaded to their device, this process can be very tedious, cumbersome and time consuming.The player works well enough. The music store limits the number of results returned on searches and in category views. This can prevent me from browsing music the way I would like. I would like to see this limit removed, and instead add pagination to allow me to browse more content.This could easily be a 5 star app, but these issues are glaring oversights that impact the overall experience."
"12606","Amazon",2017-10-05,1,"It keeps on running and running and running... There is no way to stop the app. It just keeps on starting again even if you close it. Reason enough for me to cancel my subscription. Fix this!"

"12617","Amazon",2015-10-06,2,"Forced Download = Frustrating! I really do not like that I am forced to download an app to be able to download my music. Not a bad music player, has the traditional controls. Rather counter intuitive to download the music I PAID for."
"12623","Amazon",2016-07-25,5,"Tons of free music I love this app! I have access to a ton of music and can play it on my phone, TV, and connect to bluetooth in my car. I pretty much only listen to Amazon Prime Music. The radio has too much talking and commercials and they play the same songs over and over. I can pull songs from my library or theirs and play what I want to hear. It was a huge incentive to renew my membership."
"12630","Amazon",2017-04-21,5,"Moving from Pandora to Amazon Made Me as Happy as Moving from ATT to T-Mobile After years with Pandora, I gave Amazon Music a try. It was perfect timing. I had just switched to a new job where I can not have any of my personal devices on their network. So, what feature do I love best? The ability to download the music I love. At last count, I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for - even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them. Maybe I am missing it, but I see it if I listen on my laptop but not on my phone."
"12638","Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"Great in concept, but... it is great having access to all this music as a Prime member. Unfortunately, I listen to music from my Android phone in my car most often, and that means streaming from the cloud is not feasible.Given that the app does not allow one to move the songs over to the SD card and that the internal memory of my Droid Razr has limited space due to other apps on the phone, I am unable to download more than a couple of albums at a time. Makes this less than desirable as a service."
"12641","Amazon",2015-02-09,1,"Could be a lot better. Good for the most part but a few things really make this app suck. 1 prime music almost never works on my phone. I always get a playback error. Thats brings me to number two, when a prime song does not work it will pause my play list so if I am busy with my hands I just sit in silence till I can skip the track. And my final problem is that it does not sync my playlists between devices or at least let me move my playlists to the cloud. It would be nice to only need to make a playlist once and have it on all my device or on the cloud."
"12644","Amazon",2017-04-11,1,"New updated player is hard and confusing to use The old Amazon music had many more options. Now, it is almost impossible to download any songs, this app is hard to use, the Amazon player is very confusing. I will end up purchasing on iTunes and using that. Too bad, I was hoping this would work."

"12652","Amazon",2016-03-30,5,"Great way to get music quickly and without the monthly charge. My family and I were in the car driving home from the grandparents, and we started talking about a play we recently saw Joseph and the amazing technicolor dream coat and enjoyed it so much that we wanted to listen to the music again and sing along. I know I have the cd at home, but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there, and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home and kept the driver awake in the process, which was great. It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly. Very happy and made me appreciate the service all the much more already love prime for the free 2 day shipping and use it all the time. I would recommend it to anyone who would like tons of music at their fingertips without a monthly fee."

"12657","Amazon",2015-04-10,2,"Adding a star for prime stations. I recently cleared my prime library... and let me tell you, it was a total pain in the ass. I would stopped using prime, mostly because my library was filled with garbage that got pulled along with prime playlists. Prime stations fixes that problem. I will check out the other things I have come to hate about this app and see if any of them have gotten any better. Let me be clear, for the most part I love the /idea/ of prime music. Amazon's music app implementation is just so balls awful I can not stand to use it. perplexed"

"12660","Amazon",2016-04-26,5,"Great way to stream music A great way to stream my favorite music when I am online and a great place to sample albums and songs that I might want to purchase. I play this app on my computer through my Bose computer speakers or through my tablet or phone with external speakers. When I am working around the house, I can shed the earbuds and take advantage of the very wide variety of music offered through Amazon Prime."
"12661","Amazon",2013-09-23,1,"Will not connect to the internet First I had the Amazon downloader for mp3 and that worked fine. Then Amazon came out with the cloud player and I downloaded the app. The music downloaded into itunes fine but it would download each song into windows media player twice. Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F."

I work in a school so I understand why Lowe's restrictions are there. Amazon.com is not blocked on my computer. Therefore I can utilize the Amazon music service from the computer at work. This save data on my cell phone. Because otherwise I might be streaming music from my phone to make it through the day. I find the interface easy to operate. This service remembers I like and suggest similar kinds of music."
"12665","Amazon",2016-09-09,1,"So Over It!!! So frustrated with Amazon right now. I have been having problems with this app for months and have tried everything to get it fixed.

Get off your collective rumps, Amazon, and fix this damn app!!!"

I am attempting to have separate music libraries on Echo Alexa I am unable to do this making my purchase of Echo a waste of Money!music"
"12671","Amazon",2014-09-08,2,"Still pulls cellular data while on wi-fi The functionality of the app is a little tricky to navigate but the real reason for 2 stars is that the app on my phone still seems to pull data from cell networks even while on wi-fi! AND its a huge data eater! I have other music apps that pull dramatically less data and the sound quality is just as good to my ears.I do not understand how it can still seemingly pull all its data from the cellular network while on wifi."
"12672","Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"Amazon Molasses is more like it on Android As a prime member who has bought countless albums and songs from amazon, this app is now beyond useless for streaming. Every time I open it my list of music is empty. The service spends at least half an hour loading my cloud songs every time I open it, and that is even with a strong Wifi signal. Songs are still loaded to my phone's memory instead of the SD card, so downloading the stuff directly to my phone is a nightmare. The only way I can listen to my music is to download it from the site on my pc, then install it on my memory card and use the player, or another one, to listen to the songs. I do not know who is behind the development of the app. But if I were Jeff Bezos, then I would put it into the hands of someone else. There is no reason that my entire playlist needs to be downloaded every single time I open the app. There is no reason that I should be denied the option of saving to the card instead of the phone."

"12723","Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"does not work properly First the app. It plays one or two songs, then stops. I have to hit the power button and swipe the lock screen to get the app to go to the next song. This pretty much defeats the purpose. Ergo I no longer use this app. I just listen to Pandora or Jazz Radio instead.Second, it is a nice idea to add extra free music for Prime members, but for anyone that listens to something other than current pop rock it is pretty useless. So, that is another reason to no longer bother with Amazon music.Too bad as the previous app worked perfectly."

More importantly I cannot find an option for storing downloaded music to any alternate locations. I have manually moved my music to a newly installed SD card. I hope the player will see the music there. If so, all will be well. The player itself can happily reside on the phones internal storage while the data rich music is on the SD card.

The only problem I encountered is that I downloaded so many songs that I ran out of memory on my phone and had to delete some. They are, however, still in my library in the cloud. I enjoy the recommendations that are listed based on the music I am listening too. As a result I have found artists I would not have looked into otherwise. I highly recommend the service!!!"

I read all the reviews complaining about the app size. And I am surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they can not get the music to their SD cards. it is a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit.

"12873","Amazon",2015-05-03,2,"Not ready for Prime time At first I was optimistic that his would be a great find. Then reality sunk in. I think most customers want the original music that made the charts. Here, remakes seem to rule. Oh I get it, the originals are mostly not free. it is often hard to weed out the inferior remakes by listening to one short sample. You can get caught with a bunch of lousy remakes you bought without knowing. Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they are not close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that is why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: do not bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I did not want. do not know why, but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that were not even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all.. I hope this improves. it is a great idea.,to have music as a benefit .and I did get a few playlists together with the original music I love, but at a cost..."

"12904","Amazon",2013-05-11,1,"So much for having to quit buying CD's I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I do not! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?"

Surprisingly enough Verizon does not employ anyone with an expertise in software written by Amazon, so I have a half-functional app. I supposed that would be worth 2.5 stars if it were not for the support calls literally laughing me off the call."

"12960","Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"I hate match I subscribed to iTunes Match when it first came out and hated it because many of the songs that I have are the mono versions. iTunes match would match these tracks and give me the stereo version. There was no way to get around it. Then I paid for Amazon's mp3 cloud service. They did not have an app for my iTouch but at least I could play the exact same tracks that I uploaded. When the Amazon app for the iTouch and iPhone came out, I was very happy because it worked well and it was easy to play all of the music that I uploaded. Now with this latest update to Amazon's cloud service, it is just like I am back using iTunes match. A number of my mono tracks have been matched by Amazon and I am getting the stereo version. I understand why match is available and get why it is a great tool but there really needs to be a way to bypass the match feature so people can listen to the exact mp3 they want to hear, not the one Amazon decides you should listen to. Some of the other tracks I have uploaded come from audiophile releases that sound much better than the ones offered by Amazon. So in these cases, I am losing sound quality. Please, give us the option to shut off match if we do not want it."

I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I do not mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great.

"13036","Amazon",2011-04-04,3,"BIG fan of the idea, but it needs some reworking/rethought - MY SUGGESTIONS I love the concept of a cloud drive, especially from my preferred vendor of MP3s, however the player/store needs a reworking. There are some performance issues which I am sure they are working on since this is the initial launch, however my real gripes are with their overall approach to playing music from a their own remote source.Why must shopping/playing from cloud/playing locally feel like three completely separate tasks in one app? Instead of trying to jam two apps into one, and still giving the user that segregated feeling, give this app some synergy! I know that is pretty lame buzzword, but listen...The concept is simple at the high level:The user's list of tracks should be unification of what is online only, and what they have locally... NOT two separate lists. I would like to see indicators of a track's source, but I should be able to make a playlist or at least a track selection that pulls from BOTH sources. This would actually save their bandwidth to pull from local storage whenever possible. Keep the ability to switch to offline mode, but it should not be the default, and it should NOT feel like a separate app/task/list. Much better user experience.On top of that, Amazon could sell much more music through the player by giving us the ability to sample music similar to our own library, or what we just listened to. they have got their similar customers logic down pretty good, why not put it right in the player? do not force it on us, but offer it. As much flack as Apple gets for it is Genius lists, that stuff sells a lot of music. I would think this would be easy for Amazon.My last suggestion may be a pipe dream but for Android 2.2 users, Amazon really should tie into the Voice Actions events. When I say Listen to Tool or better yet, music I do not have to my phone, the only apps on my phone that support that action are Pandora and Last.fm... Why not Amazon? If it is something I have, play it! If not, give me samples with the ability to quickly purchase. I think that could be a HUGE driver of sales.THINK ABOUT IT DEVELOPERS, THINK ABOUT IT!Lastly, as many other reviewers have said, app functionality dedicated solely to browsing for mp3's should be separate... or built into one of your other shopping apps, not into the player. I know you think that is gonna help sell music, but now I have to click extra times to get to the market because I normally use this app as a player, so I normally just wait till I am at a computer, and sometimes I forget what I wanted to look for. Not an optimal experience for the user or the salesman!"

Works great on 3g use it on the drive home to and from work with no problems. 20 gigs if you buy an album off of mp3 store how can you wrong. That is for a year and then 20 bucks a year after that. People spend more than that on coffee a month. Totally affordable! They have a customer from me. Do yourself a favor and download it now"
"13110","Amazon",2011-09-12,1,"Really, Amazon? Might be the greatest app in the history of the world - but I will never know, since it will not play my Cloud-stored purchases from Amazon and will not update. It just continually tells me there is an update - which is at least one version back, it is saying 2.0.4 - but refuses to either open or update. It just stays locked on Starting download , without ACTUALLY downloading. So I can not play the music I just bought. Amazon, sometimes you really SUCK."

"13204","Amazon",2011-06-14,4,"love amazon music store my only problem with this app is that it is sometimes inconsistent with the items shown daily on the front page of the store. the free song and the sale album should, in my opinion, always be there. a featured 69 cent song is a nice addition, but should not replace either and the same goes for a featured dollar 5 album. i do not use the cloud player from my phone often, but haven't had any problems yet. i love that my purchased songs from the site or the app go immediately to the cloud. way better to have this than some other cloud players I have tried, like the one that requires your computer at home to be on so you can listen from your phone while you are out... wtf?"

"13255","Amazon",2011-04-14,5,"Cheap and convenient music I subscribe to multiple music services, and nothing really beats the cost of ownership and convenience of amazon mp3s and cloud storage. Internet radio is a great way to discover new music, but there is still no better be value for owning and now storing your music than amazon.On a side note, giving an android app one star because it does not work on a particular piece of hardware is like giving a movie a bad review because the projector failed. Android is fragmented, but the bugs usually get worked out. The freedom that we enjoy with android carries some occasional inconvenience.Bottom line: this is a great app and service."

"13272","Amazon",2012-05-29,1,"Would give zero stars if possible. This is the slowest downloading program on the planet. it is taking literally a minute a song on a 40 song album. I realize amazon probably wants people using the cloud storage and streaming for whatever dumb reason, but unfortunately for me i suppose, I want to actually have the music I paid for without having to log into a service to use it. Total BS imo.This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I will be here another half an hour.Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can not minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can not close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I am looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer. STUPID.Also it is taking up so much bandwidth to download how is it going so slow then????! that it takes forever for an internet page to load. sweet."

"13786","Amazon",2012-04-16,1,"Amazon MP3 hindered my 911 call for emergency help I would give this application 0 stars if that were possible. It came with my Sprint phone and presumably Amazon paid Sprint so that customers could not remove the application.that is fine, I just never used it. I never bought anything, I never browsed anything, I never even opened the application.Of course, that did not stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when I was trying to do other things with the phone. It also had a fun little feature re: bug where it would use 100 percent of the phone's processor for minutes on end. I say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone. I would, randomly throughout the week, find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power.Again, mind you, I had never opened or used the application.I endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience, I was busy and it was not *that* big of an inconvenience.Then then time came when I was driving and tragically, a car in front of me struck a pedestrian. I pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg it looked like his leg had nearly come off, scrapes, contusions, broken teeth, and most likely a nasty concussion. The people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out. They stood around looking panic'd without a sense of direction. I got out of my car and dialed 911, spotted a street address posted on a nearby building, and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was.Meanwhile, my phone stalled and I waited, and waited, and waited. For 2 minutes and 14 seconds I waited for my phone to call 911 while I slowly started to freak out thinking I was not going to be able to get help for this kid.In the end I did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel, get advised on what to do for the kid, and made sure that the people freaking out did not move him neck injuries people, neck injuries.But for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying I just want to go home over and over again.Later, after I got off the phone with emergency personnel, I looked in my phone's task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call. As it turns there happened to be an application that I had never used that was, for reasons unknown, using 100 percent of the phone's processing power.Tell me, readers, which application do you suppose that was? Go on, guess.Now some of you will say that I should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app. I know right? Some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings, voiding my warranty, so that I could call emergency services in a timely fashion.Amazon MP3 was forced on me. I have never used Amazon MP3. I WILL NEVER use Amazon MP3 after that."

"13903","iHeartRadio",2012-12-23,5,"best radio app ever do not listen to the people that say u need a Facebook account cause u do not. All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones u make. Definitely worth downloading happy"

This does not bother me too much, but I feel it is important to mention. Another thing is YOU NEED A FACEBOOK ACOUNT. Since I have a Facebook this also does not bother me too much either, but that is an important issue with this app.On the upside you do not need to continually login to Facebook.-CandyApplez"

"14276","iHeartRadio",2013-08-09,3,"I heartish radio This app is nice because its free. I find the songs repeat a lot on the custom built stations. The song volume is hard to control too. One song loud..one song not loud enough. I like pandora more but, I listen to I heart radio more because there is no limit on the amount of time I can listen. I do not listen to the commercial stations on I heart radio."

"14309","iHeartRadio",2012-09-08,4,"not as good as prior version I have used this for as long as it has been available. The latest versions do not allow the user to save favorite stations unless they have a facebook account, which I do not. The prior versions allowed this, which is obviously a timesaver so as not to have to go searching through multiple cities and stations to get to the ones I wish to listen. Otherwise the selection is quite good and I use it quite often."

The music channel songs and their composers are incorrect. One channel listed Mozart as the composer of Swan Lake. What! We all heard selections from Swan Lake played over and over just this past Christmas! It was Tchaikovsky. The so-called band channels were not exclusive. For instance, the Electric Light Orchestra radio channel is not limited to ELO songs. Today, I heard Steely Dan, Journey and SuperTramp on the ELO channel. There were too many examples of wrong information. But, no one cares anymore..right, kids?"

"18677","iHeartRadio",2013-06-17,1,"This should be called I Hate Radio. it is junk. but you have to use it. The fact that stations force people to use this POS makes me hate it even more. I used to enjoy their stations via TuneIn Radio 5 stars, mobile radio done right and these morons decided they did not want to play well with others.This app is buggy. Takes *forever* to load. It has memory leak issues. It throws up stupid ads that mean one wrong touch and it is changing stations. It someone thinks it is lost it is connection. All sorts of BS.They tout it as popular. This app sucks. it is only popular because it is the only way to listen to some stations online.Rather than compete and make a better mobile radio product, they chose to be jerks and make a crappy one and not let anyone compete.Install it if these dolts bought one of the stations you like to listen to. It is or soon will be the only way to listen to them on your mobile device. Prepare to be tracked and force fed ads, too.This is not a app written for a great user experience. This is an app written to track you and what you listen to and to make more ad revenue for these idiots at ClearChannel and Cumulus. they are strategy is seems is to acquire stations with good content, micromanage that content so it is not as good as it was before, and then play gatekeeper with how to listen to it and force you into a sub par, feature poor, privacy exploiting, profit high experience."

"19333","iHeartRadio",2013-08-17,4,"Good Clean Reception I was looking for an app that could deliver streamed radio from various locations. I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type. I have found stations through the internet on my home computer, but was not able to enjoy it at work. Enter iHeart. At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem. Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference. The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I do not mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is when I am traveling, the buffer is not large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you are driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."

After two weeks I still haven't found anything I like, and I do not know how to get past all the pop stations. If I wanted to listen to my 3 local pop stations and the local rock station I would turn on my damn radio. I wanted stations from everywhere, I am sorry but the classic rock station in Texas is the same as the station in New Jersey. I feel that this app is for people who are so glued to their phones they can not be bothered to reach over and turn on the radio. Hey if you like it that is fine, this app is not for me. On another note I downloaded Tune-in radio and that app literally solved every problem I had with iHeartRadio in about 2 seconds."

I travel extensively and found this app needs a very strong internet at all times. I did find it irritating when I would dislike a song or artist I would get bombarded by other songs from the same artist. I may be the only human on earth that does not like like Prince and Madonna, but after disliking every song that came up it would seem clear that I do not wish to hear their music. I do love the music from the 80's, however those two are not everything. If you could make the app easier to customize l try it again. Thanks."

This is not what I would call listening to my local station. Also, the in-app ads run over important things during the broadcast at my local radio station. also, if my phone goes into sleep mode the radio cuts off. Overall, this app is very aggravating and I would rather have something better but unfortunately nothing is out there."

"25244","iHeartRadio",2012-08-12,3,"Better than... Pandora. At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition. While it is great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you would not hear the same stuff within the first half-hour. Overall? it is a keeper for me for now. BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes or at all unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I am all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can not find a genre to suit your mood, you are just not looking."

"25256","iHeartRadio",2014-03-03,5,"Say goodbye to satellite radio! I waited in my wife's car while she shopped at a local factory outlet. Bored with radio station choices that were available, I played with my android phone and took advantage of the strong Wi-Fi signal at the outlet. I downloaded the iHeartRadio app and was pleasantly surprised. Music stations that I never heard of from distant locations all over the USA were at my fingertips. Talk readio, Classic Rock stations, Hip Hop, Oldies, Jazz. You name it, you can find it. What a great app!"
"25262","iHeartRadio",2014-05-08,4,"Creative entertainment Great selection of music! Particular when doing tedious work...add a timer and sleep or awake to iHeart programming of choice. Most important easy to use, always like to leave room for improvement, 41/2 stars."

I listen to it all day in the office and still have 75 percent - 80 percent battery life at the end of the day. Pandora had too many commercials and it drained my Kindle battery in a matter of hours.

"25273","iHeartRadio",2014-03-09,5,"listen to radio station and play games. Can now listen to my fav radio station and play my games on my kindle. Before I could only do one or the other. My kindle will not download the player from Air1 which made me panic cause I was needing my Christian music. A couple other players that I tried was not near as user friendly. Love that I found it on amazon so I can now do more multi-tasking. happy"
"25274","iHeartRadio",2015-09-17,1,"I would like to delete or remove it and restart even though iheart radio is on my kindle I cannot open it. it is asking for something I do not know what it is. Something of a number or something else. I would like to delete or remove it and restart, but it does not even have delete, remove, or some other button for that. Very Disappointed. And I wanted to listen to my radio program. Oh well."

"25294","iHeartRadio",2014-07-05,5,"Love , love, love ! love I LOVE iHeartRadio ! it is so much better pandora, does not have any ads that interrupt your music playing like pandora. When you create your own playlist and you like certain songs, it starts to play songs more like it and not random stuff. Plus, you can listen to the radio or like I said before, create your own playlist that has no commercials ! it is so great and convenient. I suggest you to GET THIS APP. Thanks for reading, much appreciated. happy Enjoy your jammin' !"

"25305","iHeartRadio",2012-08-01,1,"Unhappy and I am annoyed Right after I downloaded it I deleted it because it skipped and you have to have an Internet connection to listen. I had heard that it was a good app but it is not worth getting. I also had a hard time using the app. I would much rather continue using Pandora and VeVo like I usually do. I reccomend that you do not get this app."
"25309","iHeartRadio",2015-02-24,1,"SUCKS They upgraded iHeartRadio and it sucks! The new version is worse than the old version. They should have just stuck with the old version. The new one always pauses, then says the application is not responding then asks you to force close the application. But whatever, I am not telling you what to do. Choice is yours."
"25315","iHeartRadio",2016-11-26,4,"Great Music I love this app, it would be great if I could listen to foreign music, like Korea pop, on this app as well. There is also an issue with the sound on the kindle, it keeps going out while the music continues to play."
"25316","iHeartRadio",2012-12-21,1,"If I Lived in New York City... Every channel I tried to pick just kept taking me back to New York City area stations. I do not live anywhere near NYC and wanted some of the stations nearer to my location that I can not pick up over the airwaves.Not at all user friendly from what I could tell, so I deleted it. I do not have time for apps that do not work the way I want them to work."
"25321","iHeartRadio",2015-03-11,5,"Awesome! Works great on my amazon fire! Love all the stations you can set up, so Dar it is better than Pandora!"

"25341","iHeartRadio",2012-08-23,2,"What happened to it? at first I loved it but now I hats it because I can create new stations and I tried everything to fix it but I wont work! it always says oops we do not have enough songs to make a station or what ever so now I have to listen to stations i created a while ago and I want different ones now I cant even listen to radio stations that I haven't already played"
"25347","iHeartRadio",2012-08-22,5,"Yay! So glad I can listen to a couple of my favorite stations and they come in clear as a bell!! I live in the hills, and get horrible reception, and am very happy that iHeartRadio is around. I wish more stations would be affiliated, but possibly Clear Channel will not integrate the system... Anyways, it is very good and I highly recommend it, and it is free!"
"25351","iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,1,"The Kindle app is a bit frustrating I have this on my phone and I do not have problems. I like to use it on my Kindle too, but once it is launched and playing I cannot get the app back up. Music plays but the screen is blank. At first I thought it was because I had used another app and tried to come back to it, which seemed logical if a bit 2009. However it does not really matter, once the music is started the only way for it to stop is when it times out or I shut my kindle all the way down. No liking or disliking songs, no changing stations, or even knowing who the current artist is. Is anyone having problems like this? I make do but I would love an update to fix this.The good news is it is stuck on a custom station made from my favorite band. that is something at least."

The whole point of downloading was so I could listen to a radio station from home and feel close to home."
"25364","iHeartRadio",2013-01-06,2,"More like iHeartBuffering My favorite radio station out of Dallas, went to this app, so I downloaded it to listen. Constantly buffers. Hiccups in audio all the time. Very unhappy, as I used to listen to the station on the TuneIn app with no problem. Hopefully ClearChannel gets their servers situated, or they are going to lose lots of listeners to other formats."
"25369","iHeartRadio",2013-03-01,5,"Music from this app makes me smile! Well, I know I have alot of apps and I bet your thinking, how does Rosecafe do it?I do it by keeping track and writing down all of the apps I have and write reviews for them. This is a really fun game, I advise getting it.Goodbye from Rosecafe again."

I know it is hard to choose so here's a small summery. iheart radio has many stations based on genre, where you want to hear it from, and you can create your own stations with commercial free included and Pandora has all that but you have to pay dollar 5.00 and skips too. Now you decide."
"25398","iHeartRadio",2012-08-05,5,"do not forget your password This is a great app! You can listen to the top stations in the country and even create your own. I liked it until I had to sign in one day, and I could not remember my password to my email address. Always remember your email password!"
"25400","iHeartRadio",2013-08-18,4,"Good App, Multiple Choices This is a good app with multiple choices. What I do not like is the constant commercials from the stations to which I listen. Tedious and repetitive commercials, especially for IHeart radio..which I am already listening to!"
"25408","iHeartRadio",2013-09-02,4,"Music to Your Ears iHeartRadio is a great app. The only problem I have with it is that it tends to crash. It has a variety of different stations that you can listen to, each of which have an array of different genres and songs. Overall, I am satisfied with it and give it my recommendation."
"25409","iHeartRadio",2014-01-07,4,"iHeartRadio This is a very refreshing version from Pandora. I love the fact that you can select the stations based on the state you are in and listen to music that is commercial free. All my favorite artist by categories or station. Thanks for giving us options outside of Pandora."
"25412","iHeartRadio",2017-08-04,3,"Works overseas. I live in Tanzania. None of the other U.S. music sites that I know of permit me to use them here. I Heart Radio does so that is great, but there are frequent pauses in their service. Maybe due to buffering?"

"25654","iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app! I love so many features about this app. The custom radio stations one can build are excellent. Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs. You can touch a button if a song plays that you do not like and it will deleted from the playlist. Like the song? Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format. As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app. I have not had that problem. I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen. Just pick one and enjoy. This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire. Thank you for making this available"

"25687","iHeartRadio",2017-04-12,5,"Great app, but I wonder, do artists get a fair shake? Somehow, I feel a bit better about this than Spotify. Whichever app you choose, you have to wonder if it is good for artists. Playing music pays well, for those at the top, but there is a lot of strugglers, and these all you can eat for free options are worrisome. But in terms of what you get, I Heart is terrific for consumers of music -- and the better you know the tunes and artists, the more mileage you will get."

"25723","iHeartRadio",2015-08-24,5,"Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora! I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? it is free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can not say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can not listen to stand up comedians, and I can not figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I am stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I do not listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I did not think it was an app problem. it is smooth, does not take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"

"25743","iHeartRadio",2014-05-16,5,"iHeartRadio - Free music and Internet Radio I chose this rating because I love to listen to various types of music! I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet. I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day. I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription. I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it. The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc. Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire! I would highly recommend this App to family, friends, and acquaintances! I hope my recommendation will entice anyone who reads it to try it out."

"25751","iHeartRadio",2014-06-06,5,"Goodbye Spotify, Hello iHeartRadio! I had not heard of iHeartRadio until I got my Kindle Fire HD 7 and now I do not know how I tolerated the unpaid edition of Spotify on my laptop for so long. You can listen to live radio stations or create your own customized station by either song or artist. So, when I plugged in Celine Dion, not only do I get, at random, various songs of hers, but it also begins playing similar artists which is a good way to learn of different artists. If you like the song playing, it offers a thumbs up and a thumbs down button. If you like the song, it acknowledges that and continues to play; if you do not like the song, it stops immediately and avoids playing it again. If you do not click on either up or down, random songs of similarity will continue to play indefinitely. If you want to retain the Celine Dion customized station, just click on the button to add it to your favorites; it will be there the next time you access iHeartRadio. The beauty of iHeartRadio is no commercials! Of course, if it is live streaming of a radio station, you will hear those commercials, but there are no commercials on the customized stations! There is probably even more to discover about iHeartRadio, but this is my early introduction and usage to date, and I am loving it! The app is free on Kindle Fire HD 7 , another plus!"
"25752","iHeartRadio",2011-12-27,3,"Hate the mandatory facebook option I love the iHeartRadio app, it works great on my Galaxy Tab, but I hate the fact that I have to log into my facebook account in order to save my favorite stations.

But then I downloaded this, let me tell you... it is way easier to use simple and I can fall asleep without leaving the music running all night long! To me it is more than just a music player, but there is no words to even describe how amazing and simple it is happy . This is just my opinion and I want you all to hear about it."
"25764","iHeartRadio",2013-08-25,5,"Love it! My husband and I both have iheart on our phones. We love how you can choose artist, genre, song, etc. We decided to purchase it for our daughter's kindle because she is always wanting to buy songs which can get expensive! We all love it!!"

I am very happy with this app!"

I love listening to different cities DJ's, preform and entertain the audience. I am able to customize my own radio station with my favorite artist and groups. I like the idea of listening to the app without giving any personal information such as name and email address. This also limits my access on the app like voting, liking etc, but I am Okay with that.This is a free app for purchase via download and install."
"25794","iHeartRadio",2017-08-09,3,"I love it, but there is two problems.... I got this app two days ago, and it is awesome! I can listen to whatever I want, and I do not even have to be on the app to listen to it! I can be on Instagram and listen to my music. In fact, I am listening to it as I am writing this review. But there is one ting about the app I absolutely CANNOT STAND. You have a limited number of times you can skip songs. That is just stupid on SO many levels. Why in the heck would an app have limited skips?!?!?!?! How stupid can you get? The other problem is that you can not be under 14 or something like that to get an account. Me and my sister had to lie to get an account. I am 13, I should be able to have an account for myself because of my age...."
"25795","iHeartRadio",2016-07-20,1,"Wth happened! I have been using this daily, for months, and loved it for my runs. Suddenly, an internal error message. What did you guys do to screw this up for all of us. would not even give you 1 star, but if I have to, I have to."
"25797","iHeartRadio",2015-02-15,5,"Is it a great app? it is an outstanding app! Wow! Honestly, I have heard the iHeart radio app commercial on the radio so many times that over and over I thought: Oh, another Pandora music station thing. sticking tongue out insert eye roll here. However, I am so impressed! I never thought I could substitute an actual radio, iTunes, mp3, or Pandora but this is so much better than Pandora! Warning before you go any further: I did sign up with my email. They have so many radio/ playlist options to choose from based on your favorite types of music. Thus far, I have not heard any songs I hate. Not only this, but the app is free. FREE! Take that Pandora! On my kindle, at least, it plays on while I go surf the web or play other apps which I find really cool. It seems as if you do not have to use your email to use the app but you will be able to customize your radio if you do. it is definitely worth the free payment and gigabite storage for you music lovers out there. I definitely recommend this app to all you and I am very picky about which games, videos, apps, books, etc. I put on my device. I hope this review was worth the read! Have a great day. happy"

I have this app on my 2012 Nexus 7 currently running Android Lollipop 5.1.1, a BLU Win JR running Windows Phone 8.1, a HP laptop Windows 8.1, and now on my new Fire HD 7.I noticed that this app is a bit slower to load while streaming and possibly prone to skipping I usually have it running in the background/screen off so not sure, but I did run this app on both the Nexus and Fire side by side on one of those Perfect For radio stations and noticed that the one on Android loaded new content a bit quicker, but I think that is because the Fire takes the time to remove any buy here links that are not Amazons. My guess is that there is a bit of code that looks at the next song on the playlist and if it is not available at Amazon, then that song will get automatically skipped."
"25819","iHeartRadio",2013-01-23,5,"Favorite Music ApP This is by far my favorite music app . i used to like Pandora and slacker. But I found this app and Its totally free. I Listen to this app from 6 to 10 every morning . I listen to Bud And Broadway. They are awesome. Couldnt live without it"
"25820","iHeartRadio",2016-04-28,5,"LOVE IT! This is such a good app! Do you wanna listen to music while playing on your other apps? Then this is for you.

"25821","iHeartRadio",2014-03-18,5,"Wonderful Way to Get the Kind of Music You Want I suspect I could use this service to get live sports talk or news and opinion, but so far I have only used it to create my own 'radio stations' based on some of my favorite musicians and singers. iHeartRadio allows you to select a particular recording artist to create a 'radio station' from and it will automatically select songs that are similar in style to the artist you have picked. It is a novel way of providing music, and the system gives you the ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on any music selection you listen to. In this way you can get your station or stations to be very close to the type of music you would like to listen to at that time.it is wonderful to be able to get music this way, and like I said there is probably a lot more I could do with the service beyond just the music."
"25822","iHeartRadio",2017-07-07,1,"Difficult Where do I start? As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I did not even choose, it is super slow, and recently it is been telling me I can not UAE it because something from my app store was not updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it is not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I am better off deleting it."
"25823","iHeartRadio",2014-12-12,5,"Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio feature after seeing them featured online-through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area. Anyhow, as in Pandora, iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally, iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as I’m listening to their music. I have over 30 music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance, the don’t stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However, here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna, pet shop boys, deppeche mode, tiesto, armin van buuren, calvin harris, 2am ambient, pitbull,dancin 90s, Britney spears , adam lambert, euro-dance, Darren hayes, foofighters, the 90s unglued, one republic, lasgo, Swedish house mafia, ellie Goulding, Fergie, robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see, the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."
"25826","iHeartRadio",2013-08-01,5,"Why I like iheart Radio I like the fact that I can pick the type of music that I like,and that it gives me a variety of what I love to listen to without having to put up with stuff that I do not like,so I recommend this site for people who love music. So I give it five stars."
"25827","iHeartRadio",2013-09-14,4,"Radio on the go The iHeartRadio app is very easy to use and can be tailored to your musical preferences. It uses the device's wireless to connect to the radio stations you love so you have to be connected to the internet or some sort of public wireless system for it to work. I found it enjoyable to use - you can choose radio stations near you or ones from where you are from if you are traveling. It lists the artist and song title during each song so you know what is playing. I found it does drain the battery considerably with prolonged use an hour or so but it is not much different than similar apps so you may want to keep it plugged in if you are going to listen to it for a while.What I did like is the ability to listen to new music and to learn who the new up and coming artists were. Again, very convenient way to listen to music and know who you are listening to."
"25829","iHeartRadio",2017-08-17,1,"Good idea bad execution for podcasts 8-24-17IT KEEPS GETTING WORSEApp now will not play the episode i select,Plus there is no easy way to report problems or get help.app is very difficult to use at times after i was forced to use it for proprietary content.when it crashes there is no indexing to where you were in a podcast you need to manually get to the point you were.there is no ability to do a quick 30 or 15 second fast forward or rewind as it requires you to manually do so on the screen which is inconvenient when in a hands free environment when you have the ability to push a button on your Bluetooth headphones.at times it starts right up and other times it just spins and forces you to close the app and hope upon restart it works properly.it is a HUGE memory hog. after a couple of months of use it needs to be uninstalled to free up memory it does not release on my Fire."
"25833","iHeartRadio",2013-04-13,4,"I like it but can not have it We live in an area with only a wireless connection to the internet.We are limited in our monthly data so must be aware of our usage and careful of it.The iHeartRadio is a wondrful APP. I was able to set up the kind of programming that I wanted.The stations were quick to come in and sound quality is very good.I am an over the hill user in that I have seen 70 a couple of years ago so my progamming tastes are dated.Even so I found the music and programming you might expect. Artie Shaw still sounds great.BUT. iHeart does a tremendous job of visuals to go along with the music.Visuals add up to excess bytes of info quickly.I had to uninstall the APP as my data usage count surged in just a few uses.If I had a good internet connection with more data per month I would be back to iHeartRadio it is a very good product.It is much better than most of the internet radio apps that I have tried. It is a good one.I wish I could keep it."

"25851","iHeartRadio",2017-05-26,1,"iheart radio - An amazing example of Crappy Technology I pretty much hate this app. These are the on going problems that I experience on a daily basis.1 If will just shut off for no reason regardless of network type.2 Often you cannot get it to restart for a while after it stops. Often when it goes down it does not come back for hours3 It will randomly restart even after you have closed the app, which can be very frustrating and embarrassing when in important meetings or at dinner.4 Sometimes only commercials play right through the radio programming causing you to miss the entire talk radio broadcast.5 There is nobody to report problems to so they never get fixed.6 The radio station that I listen too is at their mercy as complaining to them is fruitless.7 You spend more time trying to fix it, deisntall it,reinstall it, that you miss your scheduled programming.7 Bottom line, this app has received the official Crappy Technology award and I now use a cheap, and extremely reliable, AM transistor radio for my talk radio pleasure. It is reliable and never fails. number Iheartradiosucks number kfyicrappytechnology number iheartradiocrappytechnology"
"25855","iHeartRadio",2016-12-11,5,"Free music with Iheart Radio Great app for those who like different genres of music. I tune in to the Smooth Jazz stations and the music available is terrific. You can set up a number of favorite stations on the website under My Favorites by establishing log in info. No financial info required for the log in process. The best part is the music is FREE."
"25856","iHeartRadio",2016-03-29,3,"Mute the Cars for Kids jingle I would of given a 5 Star, but you have a certain advertiser Cars for Kids jingle that is WAY overplayed, I actually mute your station every time I hear it....can not stand it....plus they are just another charity that spends way too much of their advertising campaign....PLUS 40 percent donations collected goes to admin and advertising...."
"25859","iHeartRadio",2016-12-10,5,"I love this app This app is amazing!! It does not have a lot of adds. It plays songs I known that no other music app plays."

Bluetooth from tablet to a bigger speakers radio...not as good signal compared again Pandora...at least get iHeartRadio in Canada for music though. 2017: I listen to iheart more now and comes in great on tablet in USA. Pandora on my USA tv. All is.great listening."
"25865","iHeartRadio",2017-03-15,3,"Three Stars Great application for listening to radio stations through the web."
"25871","iHeartRadio",2013-04-17,5,"This is a great app I haven't explored all the bells and whistles yet with this app, but so far I am impressed. I got this for my Kindle fire for picking up local stations that sometimes get interferred with by stations coming in from CanadaI live on the North Coast and my stations come in crystal clear. It is pretty easy to use too. All you need to do is pick your home stateor any other state for that matter and a city and boom, your listening to that station in real time just like it is in your own backyard. There is also an option to make your own station by picking only the music that interests you. That feature I have yet to explore in its entirety, but when I do, I will perhaps come back and edit this review. Until then, get this app and enjoy your music! And, one more thing: it is FREE! you would be denying yourself if you do not at least give it a try. If you do not like it, delete it. Happy Listening from the North Coast!"
"25877","iHeartRadio",2013-09-18,5,"iHeart Radio I LOVE THIS APP!!! You can do tons of stuff with the email address account , or even without signing in at all; those people who say they have to delete their app just because they do not have a Facebook do not know what they are talking about. You do have a limit on how many times you can skip songs, but you can listen forever, and the skips reset the next day. There are commercials but JUST right before the station starts playing, and they are only thirty seconds long. They do not have every radio station available, but you can find your favorite artist/band and make them into their own station so you can listen anytime you want. I also love that you can exit the app and it will still play! And that you can choose if you want the most popular songs by a singer/band, or want to hear music that you might not have heard before. An unbelievably AWESOME app."

"25882","iHeartRadio",2016-07-03,5,"LOVE IT LOVE this app. Used Pandora until it glitched and I found this. I can actually use the alarm clock on my kindle. It personalizes your music by asking what u do and do not like. U can make ur own stations and I just love it. U should totally try this app."
"25883","iHeartRadio",2013-12-15,2,"more commercials lately I deleted Pandora because of the commercials. I tolerated them on IHR because they only ever seemed to come up when I logged in and they were infrequent. Lately, it seems like every time I log in and whenever I switch stations. I tolerated the UI change a few months ago because I had to. I tolerated the repetition that threatened to kill songs like Lodi through endless repetition and the songs that do not belong on the station no matter where the dial is set because I ASSumed that they were collecting data on my skips and thumbs down and would improve. I tolerated the skip limit because I figured Clear Channel would just say something dismissive like 'use your iPod' if I complainedoh, wait...I did! so I just figured I would look for a paid version. It did not come upat least not conspicuously and I lost patience just like when I try to sit through eternal and irritating commercials because I want to hear Bill Handel. that is why I only listen to KUSC any more. Congrats, Clear Channel; you drove a head of cattle away from the chute! You get a second star for helping me wake up."

This is my atf music app. Commercials are very limited and it is also great for discovering new artist related to artist you already like.It has local radio stations and I can even listen to radio stations from other areas .It also has an alarm clock feature and sleep timer you can set so you can listen while getting ready for bed and it shuts off at set time.Overall this is an exceptional app"
"25886","iHeartRadio",2012-11-16,4,"Good app, a few glitches Overall this is a really great app. I would have given it five stars except there are a couple of things that bug me about it using it on my Kindle fire. For one is the commercial you are forced to listen to every time to power the app up. it is fairly short, so it is sufferable, but it is still annoying. The other thing is that the radio will just go off for no reason. you will be listening and then all of a sudden nothing. Also, I was a bit confused by the create your own station aspect of the app. I typed in one of my fav. singers and thought it would play just his songs, but it did not, it plays anyone that is a similar genre, which is okay, just was not what I expected. The app is great especially since it is free and you can take your radio station anywhere in the house with you, which is nice if you do not have good radio reception."
"25887","iHeartRadio",2017-07-29,5,"Good for general listening I use it every day.I just wish the categories would stick to their artists.If I type in 'Weird Al', I want to listen to non-stop Al - I do not want to listen to Cake or 3 Doors Down the actual bands, not Al's parody"
"25888","iHeartRadio",2015-07-11,2,"used to be ok..but now? Too many adverts, to many dumb adverts, half the time I turn it off an listen to regular over the air radio. it is gone to the dogs. Yeah , love the stations, but it never plays consistently. So..I plan to find a paid app for music n drop iheartradio like a hot potato."
"25890","iHeartRadio",2016-12-30,5,"SIX Stars For This! This is a wonderful app! I have heard everyone talk about it, so I finally got it. It is AMAZING. It is add free, and streams any music youy can think of! there is a lot, but everyone has already said it in there reviews, soooooo.....Anyway, if you are a music lover who likes listening to the best music, I ❤ Radio is your solution."
"25898","iHeartRadio",2016-09-18,5,"Makes my work day better! Addicted to this service. Last year I started listening to the Santa Fe and Alaska radio/news and it helped me to get a better feel for the area before we visited. I love the commercial free stations and the choices.

"25908","iHeartRadio",2016-03-02,5,"Love my iHeartRadio My son got this for me because locally, my favorite two daytime radio shows on our local station was really coming in statically after the station changed broadcasting methods. So, I was given iHeartRadio and now, can hear my favorite programs through a Florida station instead of our local one. So clear. Fun to hear the FL weather and the ads too!"
"25909","iHeartRadio",2015-10-23,3,"Satisfactory This app needs serious fixing. I surf the web and the music stops and the ads they cram in your ear get stuck in your head and get redundant. They cut in to your tunes to show you the same ad you seen A FEW Minutes ago. / They need to cut it out if they want to be bumped to a B. Or I might as well give I heart a D- right now."
"25911","iHeartRadio",2013-07-19,5,"Excellent app for listening to your favorite station I came across this app when I saw it on the website of my favorite radio station. I grew up in Southern California and there was one station that I have been listening to since high school. Unfortunately, I ended up moving out of the county and could not get the station on the radio. Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD. Personally, I do not bother with logging into Facebook because I have no interest in creating my own stations. I prefer listening to live radio and like that I can choose any station in the country that they offer."
"25913","iHeartRadio",2016-10-26,5,"Best Free Radio App! Five Stars! Who does not love free music and radio? I have used iHeart Radio since it was first introduced and continue to use the app today. I love that iHeart Radio works across all of my Android Devices, Phone, Tablets, Laptops and Especially my Alexa Controlled Devices!"
"25914","iHeartRadio",2013-02-18,5,"Love it I love iHeartRadio because it allows me to listen to my favorite radio station Power 105.1 The Breakfast Club. Since I am in a different state, I would not be able to listen if it was not for iHeart. I also have some other stations that I love listening too. My local stations are not that good so I definitely appreciate iHeartRadio."
"25915","iHeartRadio",2012-12-07,3,"Needs a few improvements Overall, I like this app better than Pandora because I could not get Pandora to work for very long on my Kindle Fire HD. IHeart Radio allows you to create your own station, however...once you select an artist you like, it only plays one song from that artist and then moves on to some other artist. If my station is created by clicking on a particular artist, I would expect ALL songs to be from that same artist. Also, the app kept shutting down or freezing up on me recently. I was able to get it going again, but only after it closed by itself about 4 or 5 times, so there are obviously issues with it. It would be nice to have more stations to choose from as well, especially for California. Most of the stations were East Coast New York based stations. Otherwise, once it plays it is great for a free app."
"25920","iHeartRadio",2017-08-28,5,"I IT IS SOOO GOOOOOOOOD"
"25927","iHeartRadio",2016-04-03,5,"great for streaming music I use this app frequently. I love how easy it is to create a radio station. You can even change up what types of songs it offers you if you start hearing the same ones all the time by having it play by tuning the station to play top hits, mix or variety. I wish the amazon music app was set up more like this one."
"25930","iHeartRadio",2014-08-07,5,"iHeartRadio Steps Up Their Game Z100 is my favorite, one and a kind radio station. They just took themselves to another level. You know the crew, Greg T., Bethany, all of em'. Now you got em at your fingertips as long as you got WI-FI. You can listen to all your favorite songs while at the gym, or even at your office. This is one app to get! Yes, it is free people. See why we like iHeartRadio? Also, you got a variety of other radio stations like 'Moves That Swagger Radio'. You can even look up different artists to see if they have a station like 'Nico and Vinz Radio', and you can build your own custom station. Now stop being amazed and get this app! Prepare to be bopping your head."
"25934","iHeartRadio",2014-12-04,4,"Great App. I like it more than I wanted to, and I use it more than I thought I would. Great music for free, with commercials few and far between. My one warning, when you type and artist/band name, for a personalized radio, you do not just get that artist, you get that and any artist similar....Which is a pro or con depending upon your musical preferences. I find it a pro because I find music I might not have found otherwise, but I can see how it could be a con for some. easy to use."

"25952","iHeartRadio",2012-12-07,5,"iHeartRadio is great. I live and work in an area where the radio stations are few and they talk alot.I work in a metal building and the radio stations are very finicky about coming in and hanging thru the day.I was using Pandora and I did not mind them having an occasional commercial, but it totally locks up on commercials and I lose my music. Very annoying. I am constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial. So I downloaded iHeart. it is great. It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle, but so far it was well worth it and it did not cost anything to download the app thru Amazon. You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account, but it works great. I recommend it. I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."
"25954","iHeartRadio",2016-04-22,5,"keep it 💯💯💎 I love this app so much and I really like how u can pick the category so who ever created this app they should get first place and even money"

"25958","iHeartRadio",2015-09-16,4,"Love it, but... Okay, so I love this app with all of my heart, BUT I have some issues with it. No it does not lag, does not shut down on me, etc, but it DOES make me watch an ad before I can listen. that is my first pet peeve with this. The second one is the fact that I have a SKIP. LIMIT. It annoys me so much, I can not stand it. I have several customized stations, and the thing is, if there is a song I do not like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist, I can not. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall, a decent app. The sound quality is good, there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations, and it is easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."
"25959","iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,2,"Not as Advertised but it is free The pop-up ad on my Kindle Fire said there were hundreds of radio stations. So far I have found about 6 different KISS or KIIS FM stations from various large cities and none of them play any of the music I want to hear. I will probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I am not hopeful. At least the ap and the usage are free so I have only wasted my time at worst. Note - I thought each radio station had to have a unique call sign but apparently things have changed with the internet age."
"25960","iHeartRadio",2017-03-22,1,"Confusing to use Very confusing to use plus I realised I did not really need it since I use Amazon Prime Music."
"25964","iHeartRadio",2015-03-13,5,"Finally!!! 😉 I love this app.... minus two things... one the app has a limited number of skips witch means I can not skip songs that cuss and 2 when I pause it the app thinks that I am skipping the song...switch means I have missed Pompeii twice!!!! that is my third or second fave song!!!!! All out her wise it is a good app... oh and you have to rate the song as it is playing or else it goes as unrated! I love the lyrics feature! Now airhead know so many songs.... PS it plays songs again for the better or for the worse... yeah... take that how u want."

"25969","iHeartRadio",2014-12-26,2,"Selction of live radio channels is disappointing Very limited selection of live channels. I am unable to select the radio channels I listen to such as my local PBS channels. The classic rock statin I listen to also can not be selected. I wanted to use IHeart Radio on my TV in my living room because the radio reception, especially for AM radio, in my area is really terrible. I was also not able to find certain talk show hosts on IHeart radio either. Very disappointing."
"25974","iHeartRadio",2017-01-15,3,"Looking for classical music? I downloaded this app so I could listen to the blaze radio, but i have found other stations that I enjoy, particularly classical music, which is very difficult to find on the local radio."
"25975","iHeartRadio",2012-04-25,5,"Great Radio App This App works well! You can listen to your favorite radio stations through your cell phone or tablet! I love to be able to switch from the radio in my car, to continue listening on my phone when I get somewhere. Also, if you are out of town, or have a favorite station in a city that you used to live in, you can access those stations through this app!It works a lot better now than it did when initially released. I have very few problems with it. It usually builds up a slight delay from the actual radio station, but that just allows you to skip some commercials if you restart it at the beginning of a commercial break!I highly recommend this app to people that enjoy listening to radio stations without interruptions after leaving their car or home!"

"25978","iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,3,"not user friendly Granted I haven't used it much. The first time out was to live stream a specific radio station, which seems to be the best use of this app. Or using their pre-built play lists. To me it is not very user friendly when it comes to customizing, and to me the genres and artist lists seem limited. I do not really get their mood/activity suggestions either. I have been a big Pandora fan for several years, with a paid subscription and I would definitely use Pandora first. I was having some interference issues so I loaded iHeartRadio to compare and trouble shoot."
"25989","iHeartRadio",2013-03-09,3,"Not as good as it should be Ok app, but it limits you to how many times you can change a song from one you do not like to a different one.

Now I have the whole package and I am having fun getting acquainted with all the offerings. And the best part is the app is free!"
"25999","iHeartRadio",2012-03-31,3,"Not very good. The iHeartRadio app is okay, but not very good. The custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to Pandora or Slacker. The app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds. The interface is fast. Too fast. If you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly. There is no way to undo it if you do. If it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app is not useful. If you want to listen to the real stations, I would recommend this app. If you just want the custom stations feature, I would recommend Slacker, Pandora, or Jango instead."

Trouble is, I began to experience problems with the kindle. Running Internet radio opens up network sockets. I am not a technical wizard, but after running the radio the kindle would get hung up while I was on facebook.

"26098","iHeartRadio",2014-05-28,4,"Great for traveling or at home When I am away from home, I like to have access to my favorite radio stations. I also like to check out the stations in the area. This app is great for both. I have discovered new stations that I love that I can now access at any time. One thing I do not like is the difference in stations when using this on the computer as opposed to a tablet. Some of my favorites only come in on one and not the other."
"26100","iHeartRadio",2014-06-30,3,"Not bad, not good Not bad for casual radio, but it is been around for awhile now and has not exactly captured my interest as much as Pandora did earlier and now Spotify and iTunes Radio, which are the two services I mainly use. Adding iHeartradio as the third does not seem like a necessity. By the way, I originally downloaded this app as part of an Amazon promotion for free amazon coins."
"26101","iHeartRadio",2015-06-16,5,"Best way to hear radio from all over this wonderful country, plus make your own show with your preferences! Great way to get radio from all over the country! I knew my cousin's son was a DJ, but did not know him that well. But through this I am able to hear a morning radio show he produces in Raleigh, N.C.!! We are not allowed to promote, but if you enjoy conservative talk radio check this out. Also good for making your very own radio show, with the type of music and artists you love. I enjoy it very much."
"26103","iHeartRadio",2014-02-28,1,"IHeart Radio Too Hard to Use it is a good concept, but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites. Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the? I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east? I was hitting the choices to see what would happen. Once I got a station on favorites always by mistake, it was futile to remove it from the list. Know what? I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?! Just more headaches. The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who do not sit hitting buttons all day long. Lastly, there did not appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music. I am not a Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days. We Boomers are not dead yet, people! Provide something for our age group or lose business. Thank you."

The ability to create stations from your favorite artists and listen to radio stations from around the nation is great, and it means that you are never stuck listening to just a handful of local stations all the time.

For someone like me who has a very diverse music taste and loves tons of different genres this is great because it plays my favorite songs and introduces me to new bands that I fall in love with.

"26231","iHeartRadio",2016-03-08,4,"awesome when it is not crashing! Nice mixture of music and very low on adds especially compared to a couple others out there. Some of the stations can get a tad bit repetitive, but there is enough to choose from that I am usually content. The only issue I have is it crashes every once in a while and I end up having to restart the kindle. For the most part I can deal with that, just when it does it multiple times a day. Tedious waiting on all that when trying to just jam for a moment."

"26260","iHeartRadio",2014-01-14,2,"Al's Review I like to be able to listen to radio on my Kindle. I really do not like the difficulty of turning it on and off. When I stop the radio playing and close the kindle, it starts to play again continuously. Each time I go into the app, it is difficult to find the station I want to listen to. And when I do find it, and tap it, often I miss slightly and another one comes on. When this happens, I am unable to delete that station."

So my daughter downloaded I heart radio to my iPhone and my kindle. I could not 't fall asleep one night during my hospital stay so I turned on I heart radio. It was amazing!!!! I listened to all my favorite radio stations and songs and it helped me fall asleep. I would recommend it to every one."
"26285","iHeartRadio",2015-07-23,4,"4.5 maybe 4.8642305 In some small ways, not as versatile as Pandora. For example, Pandora allows grouping of artists in one station. Also, site info on artists is pretty handy. However, iHeart provides actual radio stations. I wish Pandora offered the same. Excellent sound quality over WiFi on a cheap ICraig Android dongle."
"26288","iHeartRadio",2017-06-28,5,"I LOVE this app I LOVE THIS APP. Nothing better. Just like a radio that know what you like and what you DO NOT LIKE. Just keep clicking if you like the song or you do not like the song and soon you will see things will change for the better. You will see."

"26293","iHeartRadio",2014-05-21,5,"Country Music....here I come Like the variety of stations available, especially country! Grew up on it and probably will never change. Afterall, when you are born in TN, raised in SO MD, you just have to love country. HOWEVER, grew up with Elvis, the Beetles and all those bands...it is all there oniHeartRadio. I love it and recommend downloading it today...you can still do anything else you want and listen too."
"26294","iHeartRadio",2015-02-20,5,"iHeartRadio is by far the best to me Out of the 3 music sources that I have, iHeartRadio is by far the best to me. New music basically all the time, good selection of stations and enough to give you choices. If you listen to Pandora long enough, you will have the same songs over and over. You will not have that withiHeart. Plus it is free !!!!"
"26302","iHeartRadio",2017-01-01,5,"Works great on Fire tablet I downloaded the app on my Fire tablet to listen to some sports stations. It works great on the tablet and so far the music plays without interruption."
"26303","iHeartRadio",2015-01-01,4,"why a limit on skips? I do love radio and would be 5 star review if you guys did not dictate what I want to listen to when I want to listen to it. If I am diving listening to the radio and something comes on I do not like or want to hear I can change as I wish... just wish I could do this on this app as well. At least slacker radio will make u listen to 1 song to get another skip back so I gave them 5 stars."

"26308","iHeartRadio",2015-10-31,5,"Free music is awesome Wonderful way to get radio stations. Originally downloaded so I could hear the Republican debates as I do not have cable. Since then, I have customized my stations and have found a lot of music as well as news radio to enjoy. it is a good addition to my Amazon Prime music."
"26312","iHeartRadio",2016-08-20,1,"Last played station is listed dead last in MY STATIONS when the app is closed then reopened later. Amazon fire version of the app places the last played station at the end of the line, on the My Stations list. The last station played should show as the first one on the list when I open this app on Fire TV. The version on my cell phone puts the last played station at the top/front of the list, which is preferable because it means I spend less time scrolling and more time listening to music and your commercials, which is how you make money."
"26315","iHeartRadio",2014-04-05,5,"GET THIS APP!!!!! This is the best radio app I have ever got. Pandora and those other radio apps you usally have to pay a fee for certain songs or stations.

"26318","iHeartRadio",2015-12-15,5,"I love it With this app you can customize the station like Pandora but also have live radio to listen to like the news or weather. So it just has that little bit more."
"26319","iHeartRadio",2015-01-05,4,"Nice app, but parents beware! This was downloaded to my pre-teen daughter's Kindle Fire and she really enjoys listening to certain stations. However, as a parent be very cautious as to which stations your child is allowed to listen as there are NO filters and lots of inappropriate material on it. I recommend your child not be left unattended while listening."
"26324","iHeartRadio",2014-04-03,3,"90 minute repeats - just like their radio stations I was hoping for more when I finally signed up for a 'IHeartRadio' account, but after 6 hours of listening today while repairing some equipment I figured out that they repeat songs every 90 minutes just like all their radio stations. When you start hearing repeats you need to go reset your starting point.Considering the amount of music available to an 'online only' music service, it astounds me that they have to repeat somgs after only 90 minutes. I thought that about broadcast radio too but got over that pretty quickly.So I will use them occasionally but it is not the 'one place' to hear music."

"26456","iHeartRadio",2016-06-25,1,"92.1 Joe Daily was not a nice person Joe Daily seems to only like people of certain backgrounds as long as they are not doing something great in life. I hired 92.1 in the hudson valley to record a commercial and part of the package deal was he was suppose to interview me on his radio show. He decided not to follow up with me as it was clear he was not comfortable with certain people being in certain positions. His conduct was beyond rude."
"26457","iHeartRadio",2015-06-27,5,"best app ever This is the best app you could ever find to listen to music it is even better than Pandora. You can listen to any radio station in the world and can search any artists anywhere. They even have special events and ask for your favorite genres to give you recommendations.Buy this stinking app!!!!!!!😁 😀"
"26458","iHeartRadio",2015-10-16,5,"High praises here... I recently received Amazon Alexa and listen to IHeartRadio often. It is very convenient and free. I just ask Alexa to play a certain genre or artist and there it is."

"26488","iHeartRadio",2017-10-12,4,"Great app Occasional hiccups on Kindle and skip limits suck, but a great music app overall. Discovering some new old favorites just about every day."
"26493","iHeartRadio",2013-11-26,5,"Pretty Great This app is pretty great if you are looking for an app that allows you to construct a radio station that will play songs similar to your choice of music. If you are looking for a playlist or a Spotify sort of app, look elsewhere. What I was impressed by was the lack of ads that a normal radio station would have, so you are able to listen to a constant stream of music, even if you are unable to choose exactly which song comes next. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; do not give it a bad rating because you are looking for something else."
"26496","iHeartRadio",2014-04-06,5,"ndh For example a few minutes and then you have any plans idea what the future will have been in able your your point out to the same as you are going so I am a good idea for the you up and down then I will we can have been to the best possible freelance work work and the beginning i used up with you want up and ui and then the primary source software to in a life is not not know if the future same thing is that true blood sugar free for the future is and how it can do for fun of the best way back now now and I am I am a good time in your room car is"

Sobif ypu get out the car or something and still want to listen to that song, listen to it on iHeartRadio! For example, I am listening to dangerous woman by Arianna Grande while typing this review."
"26502","iHeartRadio",2013-04-18,5,"Love it! You can listen to commercial free radio stations from anywhere and create your own stations based on any artist or song. what is not to love!"
"26509","iHeartRadio",2017-06-24,4,"Right Genre Wrong Artist Featured I selected an artist with 20 years of music and hundreds if not thousands of songs but in listening to the station I created I only heard 5 songs from that artist in 7 hours. I was disappointed by that however the selection/mix of music was awesome and I will continue to use iHeartRadio as my internet music app."
"26510","iHeartRadio",2016-04-21,5,"patio music at it is best... Awesome, best music app we have. When we want to listen to what we want on the patio, we hook the kindle up to a boom speaker and put I heart on and presto... Music your way. Love it...."

"26526","iHeartRadio",2014-08-25,1,"ok This app is ok. In order to get the songs you want you have to set up an account. It bugs out most of the time,making me wait for the music when I have apps open. it is really not worth it. Maybe it is just my kindle but really I would go for Pandora. Also you only have a limited amount of skips on the radio if a song comes on. Just go to Pandora."
"26528","iHeartRadio",2017-01-22,5,"Awesome This app is awesome because it as all my favorites"

"26545","iHeartRadio",2015-06-29,5,"I love it! A little confusing but still awesome!! The best songs are on kids Nick but adventure the song albums. it is only my opinion, but all the best songs are on that album. ANYWAYS, I recommend you get this app, you can listen to it as you play other games, when your on the web, but I havnt Reyes to listen while I do not have any wifi. I guess you can figure that out!! :D Try this out, it is great app! Get it and find the best albums and share it to the world, that is the reason why I am doing this now. happy"

"26550","iHeartRadio",2017-07-05,5,"Five Stars Nice app for listening to out of town radio stations"
"26551","iHeartRadio",2012-05-09,5,"AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!! Have no idea why some people are not liking this awesome app. You DO NOT need a facebook to use it as others have stated. Have had no problems on my kindle fire. There is even an option that provides you the lyrics to the song you are listening to. If you do not want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!"
"26552","iHeartRadio",2013-05-25,5,"Better than Pandora I used to subscribe paided for it to Pandora just to listen commercial free. iHeartRadio is commercial free for free in addition to being able to listen to local radio stations. Now when friends in other states tell me about this or that great radio station that they have in their listening area, I can tune-in and see what they are listening to also. I use iHeartRadio on my tablets, my iPhone, and on my streaming enabled TV...IMHO SO much better than Pandora or Yahoo Music."
"26557","iHeartRadio",2017-11-09,5,"Five Stars Love this app"

I love the fact the YOU choose I know I already said this Thanks For Reading!😊"
"26610","iHeartRadio",2012-03-20,5,"Amazing This app was so worth it. I have always loved the radio, and was shocked when I got a station from across the country! Plus the custom stations had my favorite artists and songs so I can listen to what I want, when I want. This app is amazing and if you download it you will not regret it!"
"26613","iHeartRadio",2016-11-22,4,"do not like ads, but love the app! do not like the occasional ads, but I have only had it for 2 days and I have been listening to comedy, holiday music, and acapella like my favorite group straight no chasers!"

"26616","iHeartRadio",2015-12-06,3,"eh It would be nice if when u choose an artist it would only play that artist .... But it works pretty well although every time I click the app on my kindle fire hd6 the type in ur zip code always shows up and does not like going away .... Otherwise its great"
"26621","iHeartRadio",2014-05-27,3,"Like the APP, hate the commercials. I love the convenience of being able to listen to the radio shows, I would otherwise be missing. However, the commercials are brutal. Sadly, I am use to commercials, they have unfortunately invaded everything. But if I have to listen to a countdown of the top songs by Stone Temple Pilots one more time, I think I might shoot myself. The countdowns annoy me so much, I usually just end up turning it off by the first or second set of commercials."
"26625","iHeartRadio",2016-10-27,5,"Five Stars Great country music from the 80's and its free."

"26655","iHeartRadio",2015-09-20,5,"Best music/radio app! This app is stop awsome! You can listen to music from live stations such as Z100 and for the kids Nick radio.

"26656","iHeartRadio",2016-12-17,5,"Excellent App This time the iheart radio is no internet WiFi.You can download and listen to it without internet connection when you should update it.You can control the station."
"26659","iHeartRadio",2015-03-02,5,"love love it I love this so much. It helps me do my homework and relax. If you love music and you do not want to pay for listening to songs I would suggest to get this app. It helps with everything even bad days. You can literally get any music you want.

"26668","iHeartRadio",2014-07-28,5,"in love ive always hated mainstream radio because of all of the commercials. I found out about this app through a family member and when I found out that kindle fire had the same app, I knew it would be my new favorite app. iheartradio gives you the freedom to create your own stations or discover ones you never knew existed. I love this app because if you create your own station, the only commercial you will get is at the start. I reccomend this app to every music lover."
"26669","iHeartRadio",2016-12-04,5,"Great sounds The best radio around and if you get tired of one station you can switch to another very easy."

"26683","iHeartRadio",2015-03-14,5,"True music lovers app!! I absolutely love this app!! Whatever I am in the mood for listening to, I can be sure to find it here."
"26685","iHeartRadio",2014-10-15,5,"Best Radio Music App I think this is the best radio app out there currently. I just put it on and let it roll. I like and dislike what I listen to. After awhile it sort of learns the songs I like and plays them. I leave the setting to mix so once in a while I have to vote on a new song. My music choice is rather mix, so this is perfect for listening to many music genres in one place for free. It does required a good connection for use. Have not tested other features to buy music or set up stations, but this is my music app of choice. Pandora is a close second."
"26688","iHeartRadio",2017-01-22,5,"BEST APP EVER!!! Best music app in the universe, it is free, but I would pay for something like this. Makers of iheartradio please do not charge us now."
"26693","iHeartRadio",2015-07-16,5,"Coolest App!!! I really love this app. I love hearing the gospel music. I really enjoy listening and singing along. I hope you love this app. This is rated 5 stars. I recommend Air 1, K-Love, Britt Nicole radio, and Kim Walker Smith radio. Also, music rocks!!!DaraRocks"
"26694","iHeartRadio",2014-01-28,5,"it is great! I love this app because you can create your own stations and listen to the music that you want. I especially like the 'perfect for' option, where they have different themes for different days. For example, Sunday evening you could pick relaxing, candlelight dinner, dancing, or video games music, but that is not even all of the options! This app works perfectly on the kindle fire. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music."
"26697","iHeartRadio",2012-11-21,5,"Love It My son told me about the iHeartRadio app and I love it! The great thing is I can scan stations and not lose my original station. Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."
"26699","iHeartRadio",2016-12-15,5,"BEST I downloaded this for my ill sis and she absolutely just LOVED it and I love it too so I rate it 5 stars😊"
"26703","iHeartRadio",2015-04-18,5,"My favorite local radio station was sold and converted to talk ... I am finding so many of the songs I grew up with and am really enjoying listening to them again. My favorite local radio station was sold and converted to talk radio. Very, very disappointing. there is no other station to take its place, so this gives me a very pleasant replacement, at least while I am home."
"26704","iHeartRadio",2016-12-01,5,"I heart I heart! The best for those of us who are radio and music addicts!"
"26706","iHeartRadio",2015-05-03,4,"Great for most things I listen to this app more than anything else. Only down side is some streaming radio channels like The Blaze will not play continuously. I thought maybe it was a signal strength issue till I streamed these changes from their web site and they played without issue. If they could stream live feeds more reliably, it would be a 5 star app for sure."
"26707","iHeartRadio",2017-07-18,5,"i heart is for life it is nice to have so many you can chose from. c;"
"26708","iHeartRadio",2017-01-12,1,"Not good on BlackBerry 10 Selection of music is great, my only gripe is that it does not automatically go to the next song as it did in the past. In order to advance to the next song I have to physically pick up phone and tap next. Could be my phone but Pandora does not have this problem."

"26731","iHeartRadio",2013-03-21,2,"throwing things annoyed it is a great app when it actually works. For some reason, every time I try to open it, it tells me iheartradio has stopped , I have spent more time trying to get it to work than actually using it! Done everything tech support has told me to do, even tried uninstalling. If this is supposed to be the best radio app ever it sucks. I am very VERY disappointed!! It got 2 stars for the sheer fact that the UI was good and easy to use and when the app worked it was great and played all my favorites. Fix the force close and you have 5 stars from me."
"26734","iHeartRadio",2016-03-16,3,"great but... I love this app.... when I am in the mood to only listen to one type of music. It would be fun to be able to mix it up and truly create your own music station."

"26746","iHeartRadio",2013-11-28,4,"Pandora is better I downloaded this app because of buzz on the radio. it is pretty cool because you can get local radio stations which in my location, do not come in on the real radio. I, however still prefer Pandora to this and hardly ever use this app anymore."

It only has accounts via email or Facebook for people who want to save or 'favourite' a station so you have easy access to it later. It pretty awesome AND it has NO advertisements!!! it is an awesome app, so if you liked Pandora, you will fall in love with this app."

"26799","iHeartRadio",2014-06-09,4,"Best radio App out there. I was a Pandora user like most of us, that was until they had a 6 song limit or whatever it was. I HEART is a good App that is 100 percent free and you can find just about any radio station you are looking for. I moved to Houston about two years ago and Houston is where I reside now. The one thing I missed most was the music. I found both of my favorite Hawaiian reggae stations on IHEARTRADIO. So I am able to keep up with the new jams comin out of Hawai'i! it is a blessing!"
"26803","iHeartRadio",2017-09-16,5,"Five Stars Enjoyed"
"26806","iHeartRadio",2015-07-25,5,"best app, imho I listen everyday. I love a variety of sounds and most are not found on my local airwaves. I also have insomnia really badly and listening to appropriate music helps me sleep and stay asleep. I am a shut in disabled veteran and the various music's and stations help keep me company and connected with the outside world too. I highly recommend this app to everyone, if all ages."
"26810","iHeartRadio",2014-03-09,5,"Amazing!!!!! I believe this is way better than Pandora or Slacker radio. So far, I haven't seen any limits in skipping or time. It rarely buffers, skips, or crashes. I also haven't seen one song play twice and I have found many new bands that I have never even heard of that I absolutely love! I look at all of the bad rated reviews and they look like personal problems or user error. Nothing wrong with the app itself."
"26814","iHeartRadio",2014-12-01,3,"I do not listen to Secular Music If I pick and number 34;Sacredharp Music and number 34; it will randomize to music rock,rap,pop...exc. far from it... same with Old Hymns, Gospel or even Bluegrass Gospel... can not I Heart stay within my choice to praise God?"

It works so well, it is amazing. For example, I like to hear a few people on KFI Lost Angels--I mean, Los Angeles. Well, I can get them here, on anything! I may even try to get them on my 'lectric toothbrush. I can listen on my Kindle Fire, on my lap top--I could even listen, if I wanted to, on my wonderful old Gateway desktop PC, if it hadn't of been completely destroyed by some idiot and his malware."
"26834","iHeartRadio",2017-03-25,1,"Useless Useless - Pandora is much better and is free"
"26837","iHeartRadio",2014-07-11,4,"Great App I really enjoy this app. As someone who listens to a lot of music, this helps me to find new artists that sound like ones I already like and listen to. However, they do not have some of the live stations I listen to all the time, and the alarm clock feature does not always work. Despite these minor difficulties, if you are looking for an app where you can listen to music, I suggest this one."
"26839","iHeartRadio",2014-09-11,1,"One Star Never had an opportunity to try it out due to problems with my Kindle and it was then exchange."

I was introduced to this Station by two different people and I absolutely love it. I especially like the idea of sleeping with it and waking up to it in the morning. Just like I did with old radios when I was growing up with the snooze. You can not be disappointed because their is all kinds of stations for everybody. I just had it for two days and still getting use to it. Probably will not be able to live without it, when I do get use to it. Also easy to work. Love, love, love it."
"26876","iHeartRadio",2015-01-07,5,"helpful and awesome This allows me to calm down while doing research online or just homework. It also keeps me very busy if I am bored, I just make different stations of my on of songs that I love to listen to.

"26895","iHeartRadio",2015-11-01,5,"Great You start with 1 song from 1 artist and rate the songs they play, either thumbs up or thumbs down. Thumbs up and they will play songs like that song, but if you rate a thumbs down then it plays a different song. it is a really good system."

"26986","iHeartRadio",2013-06-30,5,"A great alternative to Pandora.... Not only can you stream live radio from anywhere, but you can create your own stations based upon an artist or band. It has a great feature that allows you to dial in very similar to not-so-similar artists and you can 'sculpt' the character of the station by rating a particular song, thumbs up/down. AND you can play outside the US. Pandora? NO! Also, you can get great information about the artist, and follow links to buy material."
"26988","iHeartRadio",2014-06-19,5,"Pandora sucks I Heart radio the bome This is way better than pandora now bc u do not need to upgrade to the paid app for the advertisement at the bottom or any commercial free .or do I heart radio support commercial .but so far it is pretty good app to me"
"26989","iHeartRadio",2014-07-09,5,"great but I got it it is a thousand times better easier to find music then Pandora Pandora is okay compared to iheartradio but for each song you can skip so many times then you have to go to the web site but even then I do not get more but I still give it a five star rating I can listen to New music I have never heard and find new songs that I like look at the good side!!! happy"
"26990","iHeartRadio",2017-06-10,5,"Five Stars Easy to use."
"26991","iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,1,"WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process. Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps.. With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can not find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal. It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating. I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all. If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch. It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to. An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

"27672","Pandora",2015-11-15,4,"Very Nice Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can not get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it is the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. happy"

I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."

"27740","Pandora",2014-11-05,4,"One good and free app from Amazon Market for BB 10 I used to have Apollo Pandora Radio Client on my Blackberry playbook and got used to it especially it got no advertisement. Now with Pandora I got the same good music but ads are there. It works great on my Blackberry Passport and I highly recommend it."
"27748","Pandora",2014-01-14,2,"Before You Buy It, Wait. I bought this by reading the great comments and every single time that I login and just keep it on I actually try to just click it and when I do it says loading and it will not go on. Multiple times I download it again and it works the first time and after that it does the same things. This is now my 7th time getting it."

"27753","Pandora",2013-04-22,3,"Glitchy on the Kindle Fire HD... Love pandora as a service and use across other devices as well, but this app needs to be smoothed out for the kindle fire HD. It often will not shut off or become mute when closing the cover, and it also hampers the use of other apps while running simultaneously.it is free, and I trust they will work out the flaws eventually. Until then it gets three stars..."
"27754","Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Enjoy very much! Listen to every day. Use the alarm clock to wake with music"
"27758","Pandora",2015-11-25,5,"Awesome! Pandora is awesome and you can put it on any device that you own. It is the 'boombox' of 2015. Love it and it brings the past music era's into the here and now. Love it!"
"27759","Pandora",2015-06-14,3,"I use it every day, on my phone and ... I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it is gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening. But last year it was dollar 3.99 a month, and now it is bumped up to dollar 4.99 a month. Uh... no thank you."
"27762","Pandora",2013-11-07,5,"Can listen to my favorite songs! Love it because I just type in an artist I like and it somehow knows what other artist I like and I can listen to it without many ads at all. I can shuffle my stations and listen to all the music genres I like together . The only thing I do not like is it plays too many live versions of songs and I would rather hear the studio version."
"27764","Pandora",2013-06-16,5,"Lots of music fun! Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to like and dislike songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
"27766","Pandora",2017-09-22,5,"Five Stars Have been with Pandora for years and if it is music, Pandora's got it!"

"27814","Pandora",2016-08-10,3,"Good, but has a mind of it is own. I love that I can find the stations I am in the mood for. it is easy to use. The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone, and sometimes it kicks on by itself. It does not matter if I am at work, or school or in the middle of the night. I will not be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone, when Pandora comes on, it is loud! If that were fixed so it would not randomly start playing, I would give it 5 stars."
"27819","Pandora",2015-05-02,3,"pretty good I find it fun to listen to. It does use up your battery pretty fast though. Also, is regularly skips songs when I do not want it to. Also, it signed me up for pandora one all by itself and I do not know how to get out."

"27837","Pandora",2014-08-10,4,"Great App its a great app. u can skip the songs u do not want to listen to, but u can only skip so many. but u can listen to the station from ur favorite artist. and if u want to buy that song, it will take you straight to the site so u can buy it. it is totally awesome. I love it!"
"27839","Pandora",2014-04-13,5,"LOVE IT! I absolutely love the Pandora radio app- I can always find the music I am in the mood for, and the channels I have created also bring me new artists that I might not have heard elsewise and I really enjoy that. I haven't upgraded to Pandora One but I do not find the ads to be too hard to deal with."
"27842","Pandora",2017-07-02,5,"Good item Good item"
"27845","Pandora",2014-02-26,4,"Free Music! I enjoy having a diverse selection of artists and musicians at my fingertips! it is also an added bonus that you get to know new artists as well. If you love music, you will love Pandora. They do repeat songs and the ads are annoying but it is the price you pay for free-you can always upgrade to Pandora One."
"27854","Pandora",2015-07-12,5,"Why I love Pandora I love Pandora because I can choose stations of the genre I enjoy and stations of my favorite artists and then put on the shuffle or just listen to one station for a certain mood! could not be better!"
"27855","Pandora",2013-07-27,5,"Great App to have Pandora is a great app to have, especially for those who love music. If you wanna listen to a variety of music of a specific mood, but do not want to be bothered by making a playlist of some sort, Pandora can help you with that. Just type in a music title or some key words and Pandora will be churning out good songs that you will like in no time."

"27877","Pandora",2014-04-16,3,"just ok Pandora is grvat provided that you do not mind listenimg to attost otheer than the artost of youe choice most pd the time. I find it very frustrating. I recemtly added an srtist a,d lustened to WELL OVer100 songs on thi s station but SYILL have not heard even 1song by this artist. Thats just ridiculous."

Also, some of the channels will play a genre of music unrelated to what you are listening to. But I haven't found anything I like better...."
"27890","Pandora",2014-05-09,3,"Not as useful as I would hoped it would be This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I am out I am more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I am at home I am more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it is easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I am out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app does not get much use on the Kindle."
"27892","Pandora",2015-08-20,2,"How annoying. I used to love this More and more commercials. Put on ambient music for my infant and the commercial came on and startled him because of how abruptly loud it was. How annoying. I used to love this application"
"27896","Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"yes Love the new way you set it up Pandora. I did like the old version because it was so easy to pick the stations u wanted but this is pretty awesome the way u set it up and now I Can talk to my followers so thanks. And Pandora you have picked the best songs for my stations!The Music Listener,Lillypop"
"27899","Pandora",2016-11-06,3,"Three Stars too many commercials"
"27900","Pandora",2016-04-28,1,"Samsung 3g App is fine but the latest update will not update/install. Have tried it many times and it just stays on install pending forever."

"27907","Pandora",2013-11-16,3,"Great idea, not so great execution. I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the bugs are annoying!"
"27909","Pandora",2014-01-17,2,"hard to access I love being able to listen to music but the program is very difficult to understand how it works. There are not very clear instructions on how to get the type of music I like and put it all into a stream so I can listen. I do not want to have to have a tab for each song but rather a stream of constant music."
"27911","Pandora",2013-04-11,4,"I have had Pandora forever but am just getting acquainted I am in love with this app! I have got it on my phone, my tablet, the laptop and the desktop!! I shuffle my playlist and that is all I need to do. I plan to cancel my Netflix subscription since I really do not use it as often as I have been using Pandora and subscribe to Pandora to get rid of the commercials they are not bad but I just prefer to be commercial free"
"27912","Pandora",2013-10-31,4,"Pandora Review free version Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they are getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it is free so I can not dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it would not hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One paid version, but the thought has crossed my mind since it is only a measly dollar 3 per month dollar 36/year. This version eliminates all commercials.Pros:-free-offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in-there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations-easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button-they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes-if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons:-commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded-not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you are a daily listener-rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you are listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that is all you want to hear, but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the dollar 3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I am satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that is why I am shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."
"27914","Pandora",2015-04-29,5,"Great app for Music! I love jamming out to music, and I can choose who I listen to. No matter what my mood, Pandora has me covered."

"27919","Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Pandora Maybe I am being too generous. I have had no experience with this app on other platforms, so I can not make comparisons. I just know iWork's as advertised, much better clarity than normal radio, and less commercials. I think the options for creating your own stations are great, and I have been introduced to new music that fits my selected genre that I never would have found on my own."

"27941","Pandora",2013-08-23,5,"I love Pandora! I was hesitant at first before buying the app, but I fell in love with Pandora. I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!"
"27943","Pandora",2016-05-08,3,"Pandora is ok but, Spotify has less ads I use to love Pandora, I still use it but, THE ADS with a free account are getting ridiculous! Download Spotify, it is better."

"27947","Pandora",2013-01-09,5,"Expand your musical ear What I love about Pandora is being exposed to artists and genres that heretofore I was not aware of, then being inspired to buy artists' recordings. No commercials, just good, solid music. Interested in Brazilian? Zydeco? Salsa? Top 40? Sinatra and the Rat Pack? Karmin and more? Even little-known artists are on here Lee PressOn and the Nails for one. Give your ear a treat!"

"27962","Pandora",2013-05-21,4,"Pandora I love Pandora because of the ease of use and because I can quickly create and customize my radio stations.I did not rate Pandora a five simply because one must suscribe to the paid service for unlimited listening. That said, I will probably upgrade to the paid service anyway, because it is really a nominal cost for such a great service."

"28764","Pandora",2013-01-07,4,"Nice sounds I like having this download because thereare so any option of simularmusic to listen to.

"28831","Pandora",2013-03-03,5,"Great for music lovers I found pandora years ago with some coworkers who used it. I love the fact you can create stations that play the similar kinds of music. It does not always get it right if you pick more obscure music, but anything mainstream it picks simiar music. I introduced my wife first to it a year ago and she uses it all the time now."
"28832","Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"I love it Great to listen to the music that I love. I live in a rural area the radio does not come in very well at. Playing the music on my kindle HDx is great as I can use ear plugs as well as listen to it out loud. do not know how long my battery will last though."

"28894","Pandora",2017-03-29,1,"Freezes up meaning it spools to much To many ads and spooling I am sticking with Spotify free that has very few ads and no spooling"
"28895","Pandora",2013-03-22,1,"Horrible They make it how you have to pay, going str8t To I Heart Radio, making you have to pay for OLD SONGS that they keep repeating please, that is why you do not hear about them anymore. I do not understand people buying those ad free the premium? does not make sense half of the songs i heard are in my car on a CD?!! Useless!"
"28897","Pandora",2013-12-29,4,"Works Greattt~ The music plays even if I am not in the app itself, which is great. But it is a pain to have to go back to the app to pause the song playing. But other than that, no problems besides that sometimes Pandora can not load all the way so it makes itself freeze for some reason"
"28902","Pandora",2016-09-11,5,"Fantastic Pandora is wonderful. Really works well on the Amazon Echo."

"28934","Pandora",2014-02-06,5,"Great App, no longer need Sirius Love it, love it, love it! Create your own stations based your various likes/moods, or use Pandora's stations and fine tune them. Bluetooth in the car and works with your phone does take a lot of data. A couple bucks per month takes away the commercials."

"28982","Pandora",2013-02-18,5,"pandora equals awesome!!!!!! This app is awesome .but if you only like a certain kind of song or songs this app is not for you.to get songs you will probably like put in a band or person you most like the most. If you are getting this for your kid be warned some of the songs are not in clean version so they will cuss.this app works great on kindle. happy"
"28983","Pandora",2014-06-05,5,"Pandora I love listening to Pandora and use it everyday, especially during my commute to and from work. I love that I can change the genre of my music. I have not upgraded to the ad free yet, but would not mind having it without commercials."
"28985","Pandora",2012-09-28,5,"Awesome I have no idea why everyone does not use this. it is an amazing way to create your own radio station. Far fewer commercials that traditional radio. You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you have never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that are not played on the radio very often anymore."
"28987","Pandora",2015-07-20,5,"it is Pandora. What else can I say. it is Pandora. What else can I say."
"28988","Pandora",2017-05-26,2,"Good, but far behind the iPhone version. This app is a joke compared to the iPhone version. Very little functionality is offered compared to iPhone making playlists, streaming select songs, etc This is the same as the current iPad app, which also lacks the new features."
"28990","Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"Five Stars You need more stars"
"28993","Pandora",2017-01-05,4,"Four Stars Happy with the music and artists."

"28997","Pandora",2013-03-15,4,"Great Radio app I use Pandora on a few of my devices. I really like to use it when we have functions. The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area.I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason."
"28998","Pandora",2015-03-18,3,"Pandora V.S Spotify I think Pandora is a great app! Pandora has all the music you would want but, there is no playlists or personal music. In spotify you can create radio channels, you get recommended music, you can go to different genres of music and find specific music that you would enjoy. You can also save music to your own playlists and listen to it anywhere for free with no internet!"
"29000","Pandora",2013-01-17,5,"Oldies but Goodies enjoy completely listing to all the songs that I have chosen, and the ease with which I am able to find and select my choices."
"29001","Pandora",2013-08-30,5,"it is the best I like being able to tailor my music to my needs. I can hear tunes that I have not purchased, and if I do want to purchase them, I can. I can also learn about the artist. it is all I need."
"29005","Pandora",2014-01-18,2,"After the love has gone.... When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling. You think to yourself, Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of. You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact. You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you would get introduced to. You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening! You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true? Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked like to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on? You start to panic and say, Well maybe the free version has limitations. So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together. You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret. Why? Why Pandora Why?"
"29007","Pandora",2016-07-27,5,"Five Stars Love listening to my personalized Pandora radio while on vacation."

Pandora is like the most popular radio station in the whole world and it has all of my favorite songs on the app but the only thing I do not like about Pandora is that you can not skip how many songs you want there is a limit."
"29010","Pandora",2015-08-20,5,"Thoroughly enjoy Pandora. Love Pandora!! I have listened to it for past few years, and have multiple stations set up. The occasional commercials do not bother me at all."
"29012","Pandora",2016-03-18,3,"Music app not what I would use again I understand developers want money. it is business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly do not need my email address or login to operate. Pandora is not one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it is not for me.Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required."
"29014","Pandora",2014-08-19,5,"Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations, artists, genres and the ability to mix and match etc. The only thing I wish I could do was listen to it in my old car, but I only have unlimited streaming at home. sad"

"29105","Pandora",2013-12-08,4,"Good as far as it goes Good selections tied to one's choice of artist, although one would like more controlafter a first extended listen. A thumbs up for a song tends to spread the choices even more, asit increases the branching links rather than narrow the range."
"29112","Pandora",2016-12-27,4,"As well S the regular radio Not the best butt pretty good"
"29113","Pandora",2016-05-24,5,"Five Stars it is great to be able to listen to the music you like. and it is all for free."

"29183","Pandora",2014-12-21,3,"some good, some not so much Pandora does a nice job of establishing your favorites. So long as they permit pop-up advertising, they should also permit you to skip a song you like, without jumping to another station."

"29600","Pandora",2014-04-07,1,"Serious problem with Kindle Fire HDX after installing Pandora I do not install that many apps on my Kindle. I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything. I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer. I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened. I assumed the battery was drained. I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else. I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes. Then I tried opening it. Nothing. I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime. I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared. The indicator said 64 percent charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle. Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared. I entered my PIN, nothing. Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked. I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora. I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal. I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network. I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."

When that expired, I cancelled again.When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted. Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about and 4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

"30117","Pandora",2013-07-22,5,"Get Pandora NOW! The reason that I gave Pandora a five is that you can make your own stations and if something does not suit your taste, you can either pass it over or give it a thumbs down and pass it over. Through these processes I have created the perfect stations for my tastes."
"30119","Pandora",2014-03-05,5,"LOVE the oldies I like the idea that you can pick the type music you like, you are given numerous choices to pick from. I am new to using the new technology so, I really like beating able to filter what I like and thumbdown what I disliked."

"30215","Pandora",2013-08-30,4,"Has everything but an alarm I have tested this alongside Iheartradio. I rank I heart higher only because it has a wake up alarm. Pandora did right by adding a sleep timer. Now I just want to wake up to my favorite music."
"30217","Pandora",2013-03-10,3,"not as good as they use to be. I love the fact that I can listen to just about any type of music I want. I like old rock music, but when I am at work I can not listen to rock because I work with seniors so I put in big band or musicals and the seniors love it. The only problem is that they play to many commercials now."
"30223","Pandora",2016-02-04,4,"Good, but limited to the west Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
"30224","Pandora",2015-02-26,5,"Pandora is Tops !! Easy to get to and great selection of all types of music. Now that I am retiring I can take my tablet and listen to my faves anywhere, anytime."

"30237","Pandora",2016-12-08,5,"Five Stars Excellent"
"30241","Pandora",2015-07-09,1,"will not download It would probably be good if I was able to download it. I always get a message to try again later because of some difficulty."
"30242","Pandora",2015-07-09,5,"it is the greatest I love my Pandora app. it is so easy to use and find my favorite music. Setting up stations helps introduce me to new artists."
"30244","Pandora",2016-03-12,1,"Problems with compatibility Just downloaded this, having several problems. Freezes up, has crashed"
"30245","Pandora",2017-03-11,4,"Good, could be great Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to normalize the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up and thumbs down seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few deep tracks , just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"
"30246","Pandora",2016-08-20,5,"Five Stars Love the way I can play the music."
"30253","Pandora",2017-01-26,5,"Five Stars i like"
"30254","Pandora",2016-12-26,5,"Star Great!"
"30257","Pandora",2013-07-02,5,"Love Pandora Pandora has introduced me to so many new artists that I love. I do not have anything bad to say about it. One thing I do wish is that you could listen to a song again, or somehow store it on your device - but I understand why this can not be done. It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the dollar 36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps."
"30258","Pandora",2016-12-03,5,"Five Stars fantastic!"
"30268","Pandora",2014-05-03,5,"AWESOMENESS This is wonderful and plays a lot of good music.You can comment on songs,like them,share them,follow people,comment on people's profile.But you have to be 14 or older to log in.Still I love it"

"30274","Pandora",2015-06-10,5,"good this app is exilent. I use it all the time and it is so easy to control. And I really love the fact that it has a timer and alarm."

"30277","Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"pandora music app. A good music app. Lot and lots of music. To choose. From"
"30278","Pandora",2013-11-09,3,"glitches The update is cool and all but lately its been glitching. Every thing is easy access and all but when listening to a song and to hear glitches every five or so seconds is annoying."
"30283","Pandora",2016-11-30,5,"Five Stars Best ever."
"30288","Pandora",2016-03-26,5,"Pandora Needs Better Customer Service/Customer Support...Music Selections Are Fantastic I love the stations and feeds on Pandora but if your bank changes your debit or credit card number...you are in for many phone calls to Amazon and emails to Pandora...you can not contact Pandora directly by phone. Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it is not broke do not fix it. Sometimes I can not connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing."
"30291","Pandora",2014-03-04,4,"Great way to discover new songs and artists Through Pandora, I have discovered new artists and been reminded of old classics I would not hear anywhere else. Sure, I wish the free version did not have ads, but I understand they have to make a living like the rest of us."
"30292","Pandora",2016-12-03,5,"Five Stars Fantastic"
"30293","Pandora",2015-06-13,5,"Love it! I love being able to listen on my tablet. I like that I can pick different genres and like or dislike songs."
"30294","Pandora",2012-12-05,4,"Love this app. i would love it better if i could replay a song. The app itself runs great and I enjoy how the lyrics are provided for most songs. I have two friends who have paid for the app and they say its buggy and does not do what it claims to do so I m hesitate to pay for it. A trial period would be nice."
"30295","Pandora",2015-01-02,5,"It is easy to use Pandora is my go to choice when wanting music. It is easy to use, the choices are very good and I can not imagine not having it available when I travel."

"30838","Pandora",2012-12-30,5,"Review for Pandora. free music= awesome. you can make your own music station based on artist, genre, or even individual songs. You have a limited number of skips, though so use them wisely. I recommend making many stations of the same kind of music and switching between them to minimize on skip usage."
"30839","Pandora",2013-09-06,4,"free music app I do not mind the commercials but wish it would stop asking if you want to download the free version Pandora One. I like the service otherwise, particularly because it includes lyrics for many songs and it learns what type of music you like."
"30843","Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"Very nice! Great for listening to some of your favorite music. The ads do play in between songs if you are listening for awhile but it is still worth it. Lyrics are included, too, most of the time, and also a bio on the musician."
"30845","Pandora",2013-06-14,3,"Having trouble navigating and also expensive I am new to my kindlefire.

"30874","Pandora",2013-10-15,5,"Love this app at work It takes a while to load, but it uses less battery power then if I play the music that is loaded onto the device.Has a good shuffle, but can get stuck on a genre for a while, but its music that I like so I am not bothered by it."

I am listening as I type now. and you can get to it in the notices button on the KF just like if you were playing music out of your library."
"30908","Pandora",2014-12-01,4,"Not to bad. happy Honestly it is a good app for music. But...... it does have its flaws. It might stop or daddy forward to another song. But other than that it is awesome!!!"
"30915","Pandora",2015-10-29,4,"not always good It does not always. Play songs that are related to the person/song the radio is about."

"30934","Pandora",2013-01-08,4,"would like fewer other performers in the station Example: I just created a Les Miserable station. Now I am having to listen to unrelated music because it morphed into including non Les Miz music. I understand the need to incorporate other titles, but those other titles then bring in other unrelated music to the original topic."

You can pick your artists that you like and then it will recommend music from what you have liked. You can make your own radio stations and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs. It also puts them into categories, which I like country, alternative, etc. For example, in his country, he has the Lee Brice station, his rap the Eminem station, etc. And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc."
"30966","Pandora",2014-02-20,2,"sorry I really like Pandora, but not sure if its Pandora or my Kindle, but the song will start to play then stop and then start again. There is a pause in the middle of the song, it reminds me of my CD's skipping."

"31022","Pandora",2012-12-13,5,"A great app, hindered only by ridiculous amounts of advertising I love Pandora on my laptop, and now I love it on my Fire HD, too! It works great, but be warned that there are way more visual ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that is the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I do not spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run."

"31027","Pandora",2016-09-29,5,"Great app for a music afficionado. Love Pandora. it is a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. it is a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musicians. Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of Mississippi One... takes care of that."

One word of caution - even though it may say music for work be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity. It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting. I would not use music for work if it was an educational setting even in an office. But that is just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down. Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."

"31733","Pandora",2015-03-19,5,"great app This app has been good with all phones, but sounds even better with my new phone. Never cared for all the ads though."
"31735","Pandora",2015-07-17,5,"Great music app! What can I say, who does not love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a thumbs up or a thumbs down which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you do not feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song.It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it.I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing.I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want.I am very happy with this app!"

"32343","Pandora",2015-04-20,4,"Pandora is a fine way to listen to what you like in music. I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, 80's rock. I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it is free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"

"32709","Pandora",2013-03-14,4,"Open Sesame! Make me an old time DJ Pandora works nicely on my new Kindle Fire. So why the 4 stars vs. a 5? Because, I am not sure it really deserves more than 4! In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain.

"33824","Pandora",2015-02-21,4,"Good Listening If I could figure all of this out I bet this would be a swell way to organize my tunes."
"33830","Pandora",2016-03-24,3,"Use Spotify, it is better anyway The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole. There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to. If you do not Pandora just stops, does not play any more music, but stays open. There is not any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app. You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song. The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."

"34643","Pandora",2015-08-06,5,"Love Pandora! I think Pandora is the best option for listening to music, other than maybe the actual radio. The commercial breaks are not that long, and they are not ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there is no limit on how many channels you can have. there is the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there is always the alternative and unlimited way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can not think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you do not have internet you can not use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!"

The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I am very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and do not like respectively, over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I am an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."

"36556","Pandora",2015-07-10,4,"Alright, but does not beat Spotify. This is an awesome application as everyone knows. It works but too many apps. So if you got 5 dollar a month to pay for add-free music go ahead. The only bad thing about this service is the limit of it is music. It only has only 1 million songs. it is true; search it up. Meaning that after a while of listening to a station for so long you start noticing the same songs coming on. Easy product but it is limited.This is why I use Spotify. Spotify has 20 million songs. So pay 5 dollars for music that you can not really look for specifically or pay 10 dollars a month for no adds unlimited listening and search and play exact songs. Now I just sound like a Spotify employee lmao. Anywho, Spotify is better."

"37375","Pandora",2015-06-03,5,"great Pandora is the best."
"37377","Pandora",2016-05-06,5,"The ONLY way we listen to our 🎶!! Nothing better than this app for music! I do not mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I am using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy, playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he does not really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that was not the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So do not delay! Download today! Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! it is easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites happy"

"37388","Pandora",2016-02-10,4,"Good app, however has several small issues Great app, however I often have issues with connection. Definitely one of the best radio music app out there, but I do wish it would save what song you are on when you exit it like Spotify, although it does have far fewer commercials than Spotify and counts skips per station rather than overall."

"37395","Pandora",2011-11-15,3,"Not ready for prime time Pandora tries to guess why I like a song and send me other songs it thinks are similar. It is wrong--a lot. This would be okay if I could quickly tell it to move on, but, at least on my phone, the buttons are fairly unresponsive."

"37442","Pandora",2015-06-27,3,"Better streaming than spotify in rural areas I like pandora for long road trips. I also have way less problems streaming in rural areas than Spotify. That is... the free version It has it is pros and cons as far as playing a song you dislike repeatedly over several similar stations but is still good at introducing new artists. I have noticed that the commercials play more often than they used to and it is getting to the point where I am starting to be annoyed by it, especially since it is the same commercial over and over and over again."

"37607","Pandora",2013-07-05,3,"it is ok My real complain is that sometimes, not often, may be once a week or so, it crashes the operation system on my phone and I need to reboot it."
"37610","Pandora",2015-06-13,2,"which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly Meh. I am tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? will not renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they are focused on a young audience."
"37617","Pandora",2014-03-03,5,"Works Great!!!! Performs very well for me. It has all the music I need and more. Easy to find what you are looking for."

My only real complaint about Pandora is that you cannot press thumbs down an unlimited amount of times. It keeps giving me R and B type songs for some reason, and it will not let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."

It will not let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.2. Half the time it will not let me listen to music, it will say that it can not find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and has not gotten any better, it is done that to me very time this week I have tried to listen.3. When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.So Pandora, I am willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I will not go any higher than that because of the glitches, I would appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

First let me start by saying I think this has been improved from a few years ago because I had it on a previous phone and it did not always work properly. On my latest phone, I have not had any issues whatsoever. I love the fact that a person can create their own stations and I feel that Pandora does a good job of choosing music based upon my likes and dislikes. Pandora is used all the time at my house. I do have the free version, which has occasional ads. However, the ads are few enough that it does not bother me. If ads do annoy a person, then an ad free version of the app can be purchased."

Example, when I accidently bypassed the correct 'time' setting, it took me 2 days and hours of internet research to find how to reset. Seems to me there should be an instruction booklet with the unit. It is different that the computer I have used for years, and trying to use the on-line guide is a bit cumbersome. It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however."

Maybe because I originally got it through Google?? This is not cool.I am starting to see this Kindle as a waste of dollar dollar and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon. My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it will not play on this thing."

"41979","Pandora",2014-08-27,5,"Five Stars Love it"
"41980","Pandora",2016-09-01,1,"Hostage. Aweful! Worked well at first but it seems the service just gets more annoying the longer you go without upgrading. I can barely get one song to play with out it freezing up, and it not a speed or equipment issue as it does the same thing on several devices and at any speed."
"41982","Pandora",2016-02-11,1,"STUPID When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001 percent of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes. I really love Nightcore and Meghan Trainor Radio but I can not listen to it with all of this happening. 😩😩😩😩😩. Please fix it and I will raise my rating. Thank you!"
"41983","Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"love it Its a great song app. Love the fact I can choose a station to listen to and its a great selection."

"42001","Pandora",2012-12-16,5,"great sounds I like the feeling that I know I have music at my finger tips when and where I want it."
"42003","Pandora",2013-12-26,5,"Love it! I heard Pandora playing at someone's house several weeks ago. I decided to sign up for the free version to see what it was like. They do have ads however they are few and far between. There is no comparison to regular radio which bombard you with so many commercials it seems that there are more of them than there is music. With Pandora you can also choose your favorite genres. Most radio stations have a theme but Pandora is much better I think. I will never listen to radio again if Pandora is available."
"42004","Pandora",2012-12-26,4,"Pandora=awesome My music when i want it and i dont have to download it, what can be better. I love it"
"42011","Pandora",2012-12-25,5,"Great App Great App ! A Must Have App ! If you have only one App this is it ! Thanks Pandora!"
"42020","Pandora",2014-05-06,5,"Music to my ears Love it!"
"42021","Pandora",2016-05-15,4,"Pandora Music Service Pandora is a great music service. Free version of App has minimal commercials. Primarily interruption free listening. Create account, preferences, get recommended music. Account accessible from any device. Listen anywhere. Definitely would download again."
"42024","Pandora",2014-11-29,3,"I find the loop of music too short. I ... I find the loop of music too short. I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which should not be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there. Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens. Yes, I am on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I would hear at least a lot of that music. But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I do not mind them. I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I would get a longer time between repeat songs, but that is not what no-ads means, so I am not sure that would solve the problem."
"42033","Pandora",2014-04-20,3,"it is okay okay"
"42036","Pandora",2015-02-16,4,"self-explanatory Pandora app it is free! With adverts. And you have to create a Pandora account or sign in with an existing one. sticking tongue out And you can only use it while connected to the internet, which makes sense, but is a bit of a bummer. No airplane mode with this one! It took me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it is fairly simple, so I think I have got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet. I think it is best suited for people already familiar with Pandora, but I recommend it for anyone who is online and wants some music!"
"42038","Pandora",2012-05-08,4,"love it Ok so I discovered Pandora and fell in love with it. I like that I can change and create my own stations."
"42041","Pandora",2014-04-02,5,"very good music variety Put this on my Kindle and also my computer as I really enjoy listening to music. When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists. You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres. Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect. For example, I can not remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young. Not generally a big deal or problem. I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than 30 seconds and for me are not bothersome."
"42042","Pandora",2012-03-17,3,"review its ok but needs better options for phone. your music genre is next to none. volume control would be awesome."
"42046","Pandora",2015-06-26,5,"My favorite app! I use this every day! I absolutely love Pandora! I choose to add the monthly subscription it is like dollar 3.99 a month and the subscription is totally worth it. Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can not skip but with the subscription there are no ads. I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time. I have even found new artists and songs I did not know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix."
"42050","Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly Pandora used to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed. You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program. It does not support the menu button. It turns on and off randomly, so you can not let it idle in the background. Perfect, now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car, leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I am in a meeting or library. Awesome.... Fix your app, Pandora. There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium these issues."
"42054","Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"starting to hate ... why all of a sudden it only play 1 minute of every song but plays complete commercials??????? Get this fixed ASAP!!!"
"42057","Pandora",2013-12-30,5,"Music I like at my fingertips My neighbor helped me sign-up on Pandora. We were able to listen to great, instrumental Christmas music. Now I can listen to many different varieties of music that my wife and I enjoy. Mostly easy-listening. I have a wireless speaker that I can take to any room I want and the music is right there. What a treat. No more crap radio."
"42065","Pandora",2016-05-10,3,"Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in ... I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the dollar 15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they did not have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
"42075","Pandora",2017-03-24,5,"MyPandora I rated this app 5 stars because of how im able to personalize my stations and how wide the variety of music is I LOVE PANDORA!!!!"
"42077","Pandora",2013-01-18,5,"Pandora It is a great way to hear your favorite music when using your Kindle for another app. I also like the fact I can listen wherever I can use my Kindle."
"42084","Pandora",2016-01-29,1,"My pandora would not upload correctly so when I deleted it ... My pandora would not upload correctly so when I deleted it to try and reinstall, it erased from my apps but still said I had it in my appstore which is completely false! Everytime I hit uninstall on my amazon appstore the appstore completely closes. Very dissapointed"
"42088","Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"Waaaaaaaaaay too many ads and limitations Used to be ok, but now is loaded with ads you have to watch or listen too and limitations , they try to force you to subscribe at dollar 5 a month. No thanks, Removed."
"42091","Pandora",2016-12-16,1,"Alarm clock feature broken Whether it is Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there is one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100 percent of the time, it is an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times maybe alarm related?. Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
"42092","Pandora",2016-06-10,4,"Would get 5 stars if the buffering was not so long! I like this app but the buffering is driving me crazy!I have a Kindle Fire and the app buffers like crazy at the beginning when you start to use it.Once it starts and you get the station or music you like its ok at that time."
"42097","Pandora",2017-03-23,5,"I love listening to only the kinds of music I enjoy ... I love listening to only the kinds of music I enjoy and after a couple of days using Pandora , that is what I got . The commercials are brief and few , so the free version is still very good . It was very user friendly and simple to navigate through . I think this is a good app ."
"42098","Pandora",2013-01-22,5,"Pandora Media Review I really do like this app. My niece turned me on to this app. It is a great music media app, it to me is one of the best apps for music. I really do like the different genres for music. The music really sounds good on the Kindle Fire HD, because of the dolby audio sound system. I could listen to it all day long. I would and have recommended it to friends."
"42100","Pandora",2016-11-09,5,"It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request I am impressed. It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request. No complaints."
"42102","Pandora",2016-11-11,5,"LOOOOOOVE I love Pandora. It does not repeat songs over and over, it has almost evey artist younwould want. Love this, a total must have. Except for the fact that you habento pay for premium, but whatever."
"42103","Pandora",2016-11-04,5,"Five Stars I love listening to my gospel music on this station"
"42104","Pandora",2016-10-31,3,"Gteat idea just needs a little more development. The idea of the program is great. But there are problems. One that occurs routinely is the loss of signal. The program will need to buffer. When that happens I need to open the application manager to force a program stop. Then when the program is reloaded it works again. Until the next time. A little more variety in audio programming would be good"
"42106","Pandora",2015-02-23,1,"Spotify it better! Now Listen,Spotify is better because you can pick what songs you want to here! on pandora ypu have to wait until you find a song you like,Trust me spotify is better because when you get the game you can get a 7 day trial that lets you listen to your songs where ever you want Without WiFi and it gives you better quality and NO ADS Even know there is not a lot of ads and it only has ads about GOOD songs and Pandora gives you an ad after every song! And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music Maybe and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i do not recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!"
"42108","Pandora",2016-12-29,1,"Nope will not open on my Kindle Fire. I get a message that it cannot process my request, this after I downloaded it. Pretty annoying."
"42110","Pandora",2014-04-08,5,"Awesome App! Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. it is genious! Great was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it is an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
"42111","Pandora",2016-02-27,5,"Perfect. I have to chuckle every time I realize ... Music just for me. Perfect. I have to chuckle every time I realize that the new station I just set up plays some of the songs from my old stations. Apparently I have very consistent tastes in music."
"42113","Pandora",2015-03-31,3,"play what I want ...not pandora The fact that Pandora continues to add stations turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that is what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great."
"42115","Pandora",2016-01-25,4,"Pandora fits the bill Love Pandora radio - good variety of stations to choose from or make up your own. Pick a band you like and Pandora will create a station with your band of choice along with other singers or groups that fall into the same genre. Overall its a quality listening experience that you can take anywhere."
"42118","Pandora",2016-12-09,1,"Never downloaded Was never able to download it so how can I review it?"
"42120","Pandora",2014-04-22,4,"Love it! I am still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. it is nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"
"42122","Pandora",2016-10-09,5,"Problems with pandora I like Pandora. I would like you to do something for me. I have cerebral palsy and I like the best of Ronnie dove, and dusty Springfield. I also like leslie gore and early brenda lee. The thing is they are under different categories,. I would them all under leslie gore, so that I can listen to all together. Thank you for your attention."
"42126","Pandora",2017-03-22,5,"AWESOME APP awesome app need to get it.they have AWESOME apps.if you think of getting it you should todaly and I am 9 years old and I really like this game the most of all games."
"42128","Pandora",2016-09-12,3,"Also the UI is not super intuitive i Not sure how to Close app on my Kindle no 'x' top right to close. Other issues delay, long silent pauses may be due to my device, or cable connectivity 10GB, not the app, but I am unclear. Also the UI is not super intuitive i.e. how to look for other pre existing stations. But maybe I will like it more as I acclimate to the process. Thx!"
"42134","Pandora",2013-01-15,3,"dislike audio ads on free version After using Songza with ease, I find Pandora to be more complicated and annoying with the audio ads. it is OK."
"42135","Pandora",2017-05-18,1,"not satisfied! 2 much advertising! i want the old pandora with no distribution of nonsense.. download at own risk lol sky is better or lil shark"

"42152","Pandora",2013-07-30,5,"Hi again, If you like one of them you liked them all. I do not understand why it is a limit on your response."
"42155","Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Love it; listen to it constantly! Exposed to a huge variety of music. I did not realize the many different types of music and artist I liked. Con: classical music will be truncated - you will not hear an entire symphony"
"42158","Pandora",2015-11-10,5,"Love it Love Pandora and the great variety available for the song mix it is easy to use whether listening to one genre or choosing to shuffle. I am technologically challenged seriously and until recently only listened on my desktop Now I listen on my tablet everywhere I go."
"42164","Pandora",2014-06-16,1,"terrible You should not get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game, or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it would not even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs, or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
"42167","Pandora",2014-09-18,5,"Spectacular! I LOVE Pandora! I can listen to all my favorite artists and songs with the push of a button or touch of a screen, rather. The only downside is that you can not search specific songs. You just have to create a station and hope for the song you want to hear. Another great feature is that you can listen to stuff other than music too. I have a comedy station that brings up comedian routines, not songs."
"42169","Pandora",2013-10-04,3,"Frustrated I keep getting a constant message saying sorry, we have no more songs to play on this station,please select another. I reported it numerous times to Pandora and I get the same response from them were sorry for the frustration..try this...were sorry try this...and try that... I have deactivated my account 4 times and it still keeps happening. I have Pandora One which is dollar 3.99 a month and I am ready to cancel it."
"42170","Pandora",2017-10-05,5,"Music therapy Able to create multiple stations, you can listen to any type of music you want."
"42175","Pandora",2017-04-29,3,"Alright on Fire I love Pandora so this is a review of the app for amazon. It kinda sucks on Fire, but I am going to assume that is because I purchased a marginally acceptable dollar 39 tablet.."
"42176","Pandora",2016-07-10,4,"I love it, in a way I love it, in a way. The stations seem lazy. I wish there were more perfectness about the songs chosen, more variety. This could be a result of my clicking patterns...or not..."
"42177","Pandora",2016-11-21,4,"Four Stars Good app"
"42179","Pandora",2013-09-23,5,"Great I have had it for years...Love it.I have it on my phone, computer, Roku, and now my Kindle. Thanks"
"42183","Pandora",2014-11-21,1,"I do not understand why pandora is popular pandora is not a good product when compared to Rdio as Rdio not only lets you play stations but let you pick individual songs and listen to playlists and publisher playlists and there is a Roku station Android iTunes everything just a great product. I used Pandora for a while but I was so sick of the repetitiveness in the poor music selection that I have given up on them forever"
"42191","Pandora",2017-04-14,1,"They play good music once ina blue moon I switched to spotify ... They play good music once ina blue moon I switched to spotify it is 10000000 times better!!!!!!! U can add the songs u like to ur library!!"
"42193","Pandora",2013-06-26,5,"Good stuff I am not a kid and do not get too worked up about my favorite apps and do not spend the day staring at my phone if you know what I mean. I absolutely love pulling up Pandora's 'oldies' stations on my tablet, plugging in the earphones and relaxing while my wife watches reality TV shows. ;oPandora is a pleasant surprise."
"42194","Pandora",2016-05-17,1,"Awful I chose 50s country. Rockabilly, with Patsy Cline, Rick Nelson, and others played for a few minutes. Not necessarily my favorite, but not bad.Then out of the blue, the next song began playing horrible lyrics, with the F bomb repeating, over and over and OVER, as I frantically tried to close it.Last time I checked, 50s country did NOT have those lyrics!!!I exited that app, never to return. I will stick to my iheart radio, thank you."
"42203","Pandora",2014-01-07,1,"will not work on my fire hd 8.9 One star due to the lack of function on my kindle fire hd. I love my pandora on my droid phone."
"42206","Pandora",2014-02-21,2,"Not great. It is okay. If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit like it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."
"42208","Pandora",2017-07-12,2,"Bad I do not want to listen to OTHER PEOPLE'S SONG, I want to listen to MY SONG, so please make a urgent update because it is so annoying to listen a song that yoiu do not want to hear or even know about!! Think about that before publishing a music app!!"
"42214","Pandora",2015-12-15,1,"Wth happened to Pandora!!! I have been a huge Pandora fan loved it! I recommended to all my friends, well until I had to update it, the new update sucks! I hate the layout then it just randomly stops playing, I will think it is an add coming on but NO it just stops. Sorry Pandora WAS a loyal fan and listener but ill be finding a new radio app!"
"42226","Pandora",2014-11-08,1,"My kids love it; but my experience was awful After I downloaded, I never got in successfully to listen to any music. It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support. After 5 minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone. My kids love it; but my experience was awful. iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I have never had a problem with it......guess I will use that from now on."
"42228","Pandora",2015-12-30,1,"will not play on kindle fire Like many other recent reviewers said, the app does not work on kindle fire or at least not on mine and theirs. Everything but the actual music will work -- I can see the songs playing, they just do not make any noise despite having the volume up. I am disappointed and I hope they offer a solution soon."

"42240","Pandora",2013-10-20,1,"This app does not work on kindle fire HD. I thought I would download the app on my kindle fire HD just to see if all the reviews were true. They. Are. True. it is very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and does not change. I hope they fix the bugs! I can not complain too much because the app was free, but it is still frustrating."
"42241","Pandora",2013-08-31,3,"Love it and hate it I love Pandora and am a paid subscriber. However, every time I want to launch it I have to go into Apps and do a shut down. It does not always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature. Then it will launch ok. I talked to kindle support about this several weeks ago and they were able to reproduce the problem. They said they would research and get back to me within five days but I am still waiting. I am getting ready to call them back."
"42245","Pandora",2014-08-05,2,"HORRIBLE KEEPS STALLING Im not that happy with Pandora right now I have been having problems with the application for some reason it just stalls and will not keep playing music I have never had this problem in the past but since it updated im guessing that something went wrong !!!"

"42255","Pandora",2013-02-04,1,"could not get it to work it kept wanting me to sign in and would not take my password and then they would ask for a new one and would not take it."
"42256","Pandora",2015-01-05,5,"Beats Spotify radio Pandora is wonderful, you have to train your stations just a little at first, but once you do it is fabulous. Much better than Spotify's radio function which offers little variety. it is obvious how much time and care they put into the music genome project."
"42257","Pandora",2017-06-12,1,"I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS AND IT SHOWED UP AS A PURCHASE IN MY ACCOUNT This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it. I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password."
"42259","Pandora",2017-07-01,4,"Great music app. A fine way to take music along as you go. I do not like the commercials, but the price is right."
"42262","Pandora",2016-05-14,5,"Best Music App out there I love my Pandora App. I use it daily to listen to music. I can never find anything good on the radio so I always turn to my Pandora App for my number one source of music. it is super easy to use. Just type in a band, artist, or song you like and Pandora will suggest different songs and Artists that sound similar to what you have chosen. You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs that you do not like and Pandora will not play those any longer. The more you rate and customize your stations the more Pandora will play only songs that you like. it is perfect for me for when I am listening to music in my car, at the gym, or just about anytime I want to hear music. I have to say that this has got to be one of my favorite apps ever."
"42263","Pandora",2014-07-09,1,"Why Pandora When I first started Pandora I thought it was great, not once did it mess up. Then Today when they updated it it crashes sometimes, and my comments stopped working. I had to create a new account, my old account had 157 followers and I comment on any, songs, or people's pages. It was once 5 stars now it is 1. I still use it though"
"42265","Pandora",2012-12-30,2,"LOADED TALK ABOUT ADS AND COMMERCIALS! ATTEMPT CHANGING SONG OR ARTIST AND POP UP ADS SPROUT UP LIKE WEEDS AND COVER MOST OF THE SCREEN. YOU SPEND MORE TIME DELETING ADS THAN LISTENING TO MUSIC, ONLY TO FIND COMMERCIALS ON THE NETWORK. RATHER LISTEN TO MY OWN CD PLAYLISTS I CREATED."
"42271","Pandora",2016-10-15,4,"Pandora Passes with a Grade B Pretty good BUT could use less commercials not more which seems to be the case and expand the library."
"42278","Pandora",2017-06-24,4,"Rock me baby Pretty good. Lots competition. Does good job at recording my likes and customizing my stations"
"42281","Pandora",2015-10-21,5,"I can not live without Pandora! I love my Pandora! I can stream the music I am in the mood for anytime, anywhere, on my desktop computer, any mobile device, and in my car using my aux cable to my phone, all commercial free. I can create stations by a favorite artist and all similar will play. I have discovered a few new artists this way that have become favorites as well! I do not need CDs, Satellite radio, an MP3 player, or anything!"
"42282","Pandora",2016-06-22,1,"no longer works This app used to work but now it will only play music for 1 second then stop completely. Please fix or update thank you"
"42284","Pandora",2014-01-23,1,"Works on my IPhone but not on my Kindle Fire HD Whenever I sign in it says it is having technical difficulties. I have logged off of my account on my phone and then in again to check the password but it is still now working."
"42289","Pandora",2017-10-13,3,"Three Stars When I switched to Premium I started having a lot of problems with the app."
"42290","Pandora",2015-04-21,1,"too bad. Used to work. Now it will not load a single song on WiFi or LTE. I WAS a pandora one subscriber. No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can not even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best."
"42292","Pandora",2013-12-09,1,"Way too many comercials. I do not mind a commercial a few times an hour, it almost like listening to radio - sometimes after 2 songs... I am sorry, but I am never going to buy a Jeep or Lexus. I have switched to Jango and grooveshark. And deleted it off my devices. Also it is always on, you have to force close Pandora as well to completely turn off."
"42293","Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"Music How can you go wrong with App, you have a choice of any music you want, and I absolutely love it!!"
"42301","Pandora",2013-02-28,5,"Great music As always, Pandora is my choice of what I want to listen to in music. I am able to choose good Jazz, Big Band music which is almost impossible to find on ordinary music stations. Thanks for providing this choice."
"42304","Pandora",2014-01-23,2,"will not work overseas I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats."

"42313","Pandora",2012-12-03,1,"Hated it I downloaded iheart radio instead which is free too. Pandora is nothing but annoying ads in your face saying to buy a subscription to get this off blah blah blahDeleted it instead and got a better application."
"42323","Pandora",2013-02-08,5,"Love Pandora I love being able to pick the artists that I want to listen to. We have very few stations available and the music selection is undesirable so Pandora is a wonderful alternative to listening pleasure."
"42324","Pandora",2016-07-15,2,"There music is good but ALL LIVES MATTER Because of there stand on black lives matter. I give them 2. They chose to go political and I counter with a 2 star they have no place to make a political statement. There music is good but ALL LIVES MATTER."
"42326","Pandora",2013-03-08,5,"BEST IDEA EVER!!! I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i did not have to listen to ads anymore. I have never been happier with any other music source. As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100 percent of the time. I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire, It is the best thing that ever happened to Music. Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down. If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like. It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved. The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using. It is just too great for words."
"42328","Pandora",2016-11-02,5,"Super Music makes everything better. Thanks, Pandora!"
"42330","Pandora",2013-12-28,1,"Pandora review When I first started using Pandora there were NO advertising. Now there is nothing but advertising throughout the whole Pandora. I hate all those damn advertising. But I have to upgrade to Pandora 1 and pay 3.99 per month to not get all the advertising. Well I guess I will not be using Pandora anymore."
"42334","Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Amazing with a problem. This is a great app for music lover's! You can listen to the music while doing something else at the same time. The only bad thing is that you can only skip five songs a hour and adds come endless you by membership or whatever it is called"
"42335","Pandora",2013-01-22,5,"Good for ambience I hosted a sewing party and used Pandora on my Kindle to give us some interesting background noise . After 5 solid hours without pauses in service or repeated tracks, I am a happy camper."
"42336","Pandora",2013-02-14,3,"pop up nuisance! The free versions' adds especially the pop ups are very disruptive and worse than other services I am aware of.I am considering the paid version but checking other services more closely first."

"42343","Pandora",2014-01-04,5,"For Music Lovers I have actually had Pandora for years. it is the place I can go to when I want to listen to the music I like to hear gospel. I can choose who and what I like and Pandora will add the same type of music to my choices; if I like it I can keep it, and if not I can just give it a thumbs down and I will not have to hear it anymore. I happen to like my Pandora commercial-free, so I pay a small yearly fee for that luxury, but if you do not mind the commercials, you do not have to pay anything to enjoy your kind of music."
"42350","Pandora",2013-01-13,1,"bad radio Friday time after I registered Pandora It rejected my email and password. After a lot of times 're-downloading .It still did not work. So please do not get the app . I know it is a popular choice of radio like apps."

"42363","Pandora",2015-11-11,2,"Too many ads everywhere! Good idea, good app, decent music BUT:1. You can not pick EXACTLY what artist or song you want to listen to. You pick the genre and HOPE it comes on...2. There are annoying ads all over the place...not only in the bottom but you also have to skip to none skippable ads too.3. You can not skip songs more than 6 times per stations."

"42433","Pandora",2016-06-02,2,"ads!!!??? So many ads, so little music. Also, the ad is displayed and in your way all the time. I thought about paying for the service but the price jumped up way too high."

"42447","Pandora",2015-10-11,1,"BLAHHHHHHHZAY! C GRADE! Terrible selections - very limited, unless you only follow easy listening or mainstream for the masses. Classical very limited. I searched ? Madrigals and Renaissance and Early music and came up with rock bands with those words in their names. Just mass junk, really and will not recommend to a music connisseur."
"42449","Pandora",2012-09-17,1,"not what used to be It started out really good but then it took a turn for the worst, it crashed multipule times.

"42494","Pandora",2015-08-07,3,"What did you do Kindle/Amazon? This is a perfectly fine app when it works, but there was some weird update to Kindle's that make it impossible to watch youtube videos and now Pandora is going haywire and skipping around all crazy. GET IT FIXED!"

Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of free music I rushed to download this Pandora app. And for a while, it met all my needs. However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music. If you just want random background noise random music that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice. But if you want to actually pick the song and not just the genre! of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .If you still are not convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision sticking tongue out ANDORA1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is dollar 4.99/month.3. Library size - 1 million songs.4. Can user pick song? NO.5. Can user skip songs? Yes.

"42953","Pandora",2014-12-27,5,"Love Pandora I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can not pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been dollar 36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended."

We searched for two years for a server, never giving up the hope that we could install wt-fi to receive Pandora in our home.

"43060","Pandora",2016-02-23,5,"Great substitute for a glovebox full of CD's Very good at stringing together music that sounds sort of like what you typed in. I particularly like how it is divided into stations, so as your mood shifts, you can switch stations simply, and get a new vibe. The ads are a little spooky though. They are all about home, and when I am on the road, that deprives me of the experience of foreign radio culture."
"43061","Pandora",2016-12-02,5,"Why do not you have this already? Pandora is great.

"43087","Pandora",2016-02-12,5,"Favorite music app With all the music apps that I have downloaded and deleted from my phone, Pandora is the only one I have kept. If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I do not like a song, I simply hit thumbs down . If I like a song, I hit thumbs up and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I have never heard before. it is nice to shake things up sometimes."

"43098","Pandora",2017-11-13,5,"Good music to listen to when working on my 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air...... It is easy to use and you can pick the music you like and build your own stations. I have been using Pandora for well over 10 years and I think it is the best. You can listen for free and get the occasional ad or pay a very fair monthly price and get ad free music with a lot of neat extras. I miss the days of AM radio with unbiased DJs and good music - the kind of music we listened to when cruising the boulevards back in the early sixties......Pandora brings that time back. Works well with bluetooth."
"43099","Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"Pandora's great! What can I say. I just discovered Pandora and I love being able to have just the music I want. there are some commercials but so what, not anymore than you would get on a radio station,if as many and you get just what you want."
"43101","Pandora",2016-06-25,5,"Great!!! This app lwets you listen to the songs you love and let us you learn some, as well."
"43102","Pandora",2017-06-09,4,"Four Stars Somewhat difficult to navigate, especially if you are interested in concentrating on a single artist."
"43107","Pandora",2015-03-10,5,"Pandora custom radio Pandora is a very user friendly radio app. Its song library is huge, and the programming works great. This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you. it is important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise. I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists. This is an app I use daily."
"43111","Pandora",2015-12-02,5,"I love Pandora because it has a wide variety of music ... My daughter gave me a Bose and showed me how to stream it to my Kindle. She then put Pandora on my Kindle. I now can carry my music to any room I am in. I love Pandora because it has a wide variety of music with few ads and it is free!"
"43113","Pandora",2017-08-15,2,"Dumbed down and prices raised = lousy annoying arrogant Pandora Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons. Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month. Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out. So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers. Maybe it is ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I have switched to Amazon Music."
"43119","Pandora",2015-12-19,5,"Awesome! Pandora saves lives! I listen to Pandora religiously. It adds different music to the station based on things you indicate that you like. It sometimes repeats songs maybe an hour or two after listening to the station but it does not happen frequently. I would not know what I would do without this app!"
"43124","Pandora",2013-04-12,5,"best thing since sliced bread I bought me a blue tooth portable speaker soundfreq highly recommend it. Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq. Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone does not like the music i just type in what they like and there happy. I did have problems getting a specific song but it really did not matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version. Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."
"43130","Pandora",2012-09-22,5,"Love the new update! this new update lets you view the lyrics and I love it! And they play the same ad over and over because that is who payed for it duh !"
"43134","Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Best streaming option. Absolutely the best source of music streaming. Not that there are not other good ones... Pandora is just a little above all of the others. Pandora gives you 3 choices of service level. I recently switched from some commercials to the lower of two commercial free options. All 3 are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this mid-level of service for some time to come. I really appreciate the ability to listen off line when there is no good streaming source available."
"43139","Pandora",2017-06-21,5,"Five Stars Enjoy the musiv"
"43145","Pandora",2016-06-21,5,"work's well for me In my opinion this app works well just try it if you haven't before and you may like it also."
"43150","Pandora",2016-10-31,5,"Five Stars I like the fact that I can choose my own music and I can also save them"
"43154","Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best. The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet if they would reconnect at all. Pandora seems to have a very strong connection. Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music. It also does not inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements. Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
"43155","Pandora",2011-11-13,1,"Songs never finish I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I am very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
"43156","Pandora",2016-10-15,1,"SCAM !!!! WHAT A SCAM PANDORA IS !!!! It is literally impossible to cancel my subscription!"
"43160","Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"GREAT Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to"
"43163","Pandora",2016-04-20,4,"A Great Place for Music I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I have chosen. To be honest I have only downloaded the app because I do not want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I have created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I am listening to is truly top notch.In a nutshell, I really do not do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."
"43166","Pandora",2013-08-27,5,"Enjoy it I enjoy having this on my kindle, fun to listen to music while reading my email or checking out facebook"
"43168","Pandora",2014-04-18,5,"Always liked Pandora, Also have Desktop App From Inception! I use other music services too, but Pandora is a go to.do not forget, that it is enjoyable to get specific music you like to listen too. It seems this will be a standard now.In order to preserve all these services, do not forget to shut it down when your not listening. Mind you, they do not pay a lot of money to the music industry per song, but those costs can build up. Act accordingly, and services like this will get better and better. Or go out of business."
"43173","Pandora",2017-11-08,5,"I love it and use it daily on every device I ... do not know why this is here on Amazon, unless they are trying to compare Amazon Prime music with Pandora. OK, I have been a member/customer of Pandora for 9 years, and once quit using because of too many ads, when they quit the distasteful number of ads on free I went back and next decided to go to Pandora-One and recently went even further to Pandora ultimate with no ads at all. I love it and use it daily on every device I own. I have no complaints. The music is clear and good EQ, perfect for headphones, all Bluetooth speakers and love the stories of the lives of artists."
"43178","Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"One of the best music apps! We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
"43179","Pandora",2016-04-03,5,"Amazing!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. it is amazing! I very much recommend this app!"

"43195","Pandora",2012-12-26,5,"Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire I love love love Pandora and have used it for a few years now!! You can not get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now and not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
"43199","Pandora",2013-01-04,5,"perfect it is the perfect radio, I highly recommend having this app! Just watch out if u do not have unlimited data and its all good. Great for anyone who loves music."
"43200","Pandora",2017-10-29,5,"Who does not like Pandora? I have had it for almost 10 years ... Who does not like Pandora? I have had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I am in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I don’t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and they’re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free."
"43207","Pandora",2017-02-16,5,"Amazing This app is not like others. It allows you to sing along with the lyrics option. In my opinion that is great."
"43209","Pandora",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars Pandora Rocks!"
"43216","Pandora",2014-12-01,5,"Love my Pandora. Love Pandora. I can listen to all types of music. I have at least 20 different styles of music and keep adding to when I hear something I like.

"43217","Pandora",2013-08-29,1,"well it was good! This was a fantastic app until one day it decided to stop working. Nothing more than a blue Pandora screen now sad"
"43218","Pandora",2013-01-09,5,"Music I like!!!! Pandora is a great radio app.IMO much better than mobile Spotify!!Just type in a favorite artist or song and a stations will be created for you.As you rate the songs it will personalize the selections over time.I am very happy I installed this app.Best thing is you can put your device in standby and the music still plays while saving battery life.Sound quality is FANTASTIC!!! Enjoy.....JoeUpdate:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can not go back and play them,you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on and a great song was skippednot by me!!! I still love the app!!tunein is better though"
"43221","Pandora",2016-06-18,3,"I have some concerns Its cool and all just there is no search it only has a few songs I like it but it needs some more things to it. Spotify is way better!"
"43222","Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Kindle Pandora App works great! The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD. I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian. Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy. Pandora definitely targets well."

"43237","Pandora",2017-07-16,5,"why pay big bucks for xm/serius when you can listen for free ! dont pay for xm/serius when you have pandora for free ! much better when you can control your music with likes,and dislikes. and if you want more control you can pay dollar 5 a month more and get it all ! luv it , luv it, can not get enuf of it !"
"43241","Pandora",2016-03-15,4,"I love portable music! I can hear anything I want, anytime. Great app. I really enjoy Pandora very much. The only problem I have had is very occasional dead air for a minute here and there. I dislike the commercials. I have a Bluetooth Speaker and I get to bring Pandora with me wherever I go! Great for gatherings of any sort. I also use it as background for my Meditation classes. An amazingly huge amount of music, all genres, are available. Love it!"
"43246","Pandora",2016-05-31,5,"easy to use Same as the website, easy to use, my son 7yo has his music playing non-stop on his kindle at home.If my review was helpful, please hit yes !"
"43252","Pandora",2017-10-04,5,"can not go wrong With being able to listen and at the same time make your own channels"
"43255","Pandora",2017-03-03,5,"Five Stars works great"
"43260","Pandora",2016-09-03,3,"I like my MP3 anyway I had a phone, tablet, laptop stolen. I get new ones, log in except for here never asked if had an account. I had to re pay for what I had. So not sure if will stay with it. I like my MP3 anyway. Did like the music."
"43263","Pandora",2014-04-05,4,"For music lovers I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it. I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind. There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs. Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many. For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
"43267","Pandora",2017-07-22,4,"Great service Very cool. I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice. To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely."
"43271","Pandora",2017-09-20,4,"Four Stars did not know I ordered it but I do like Pandora"
"43273","Pandora",2017-03-17,5,"Five Stars Great app"
"43281","Pandora",2016-10-22,3,"do not lie!!!!!!😒 For a while I loved Pandora after awhile I did not use it as much today they sent me an email saying that the updated version had replay.I was so happy that I downloaded it.I went on and of course the replay button is not there"
"43283","Pandora",2017-03-24,3,"Well I can honestly say this is my favorite radio station and I have used it for many years Well I can honestly say this is my favorite radio station and I have used it for many years. But when you have a problem with it, it is impossible to get it fixed. My son gave me a gift card and it is not working. I have written so many times and on one will help me. The free version sucks ads so you really need to pay for it. I think if you buy it from Amazon it will be better than buying it from Pandora directly. Amazon takes care of their customers but Pandora does not. Next time, I will go through Amazon so they will look after me!"
"43284","Pandora",2017-10-20,3,"Used to be a great product. Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore yet it does not need it to run?!."
"43286","Pandora",2016-10-23,4,"Love the music not the commercials All the commercials suck, I pay for Pandora music not commercials."
"43288","Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes I have been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it is satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I am on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I am not sure if it is just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on highI have unlimited data, so it is not a problem for me. it is free so it is worth it but if you are thinking of getting Pandora OnePremium Membership that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it is a lot better in my opinion."
"43289","Pandora",2017-03-05,5,"Daily Music Choice I listen everyday via, TV, telephone or something. Good variety and will play your choices if you rate the songs."
"43290","Pandora",2013-03-14,5,"Get this app! Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you will not regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
"43294","Pandora",2017-07-24,4,"Other than that I enjoy it Too many commercials. Other than that I enjoy it"
"43295","Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora amazes me, and I am a vinyl and radio junkie from way back. do not cheat yourself; try this one! Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it is commercial free if you pay the modest dollar 36.00 US or so per year. Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you will get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose. I can not recommend Pandora highly enough. If you are tired of normal radio, try Pandora. you will listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love. it is almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go! Try it....I would be really surprised if you do not love it. You define your stations however you would like. Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
"43296","Pandora",2017-08-15,2,"Stations just plain missing the mark Pandora is an OK service, but the ability to create a station is quite overblown. When one creates a station with a very popular performer, that performer should be 50-70 percent at least of the songs played. I often find that percentage down around 10-20 percent . While I like being introduced to new artists that I might not have heard before, making them the most played is not what I am looking for.I can go to YouTube and get all the songs I want from any artist I want.that is the main reason I do not upgrade; it is not quite what I am looking for. Comments welcome and info about upgrade features would be interesting."
"43298","Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"great app I have been using Pandora for years and an always amazed by how will it chooses songs. I made a 6 hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song. The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because you can not necessarily get the exact song you are looking for, you may have to wait a few songs for it to come up."
"43299","Pandora",2013-01-16,4,"Radio Service it is easy to access, otherwise in this remote area Olympic Peninsula we have no radio service. I have been able to get all the types of music I enjoy listening to without interrupting ads or new broadcasts or sports!"
"43306","Pandora",2014-05-27,5,"Free Radio Listen to PANDORA all the time, i will say sometimes the songs are repetitive, but that is why it is important to click the thumbs up or down button as you are presented songs you like and do not like. It will start to figure out what you like and give you more thumbs up type of music happy"
"43312","Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"A programable music station catering to what you want to hear! I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I did not know what to expect. I was surprised to find it easy to use and it is free. Not many bargains like this today. You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day. Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music. You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song. You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations. Share your stations with others also. what is not to like."
"43316","Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"Five Stars Thank You"
"43318","Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"*The* way to listen to music An excellent selection of music from all genres interrupted only occasionally by a single short commercial message."
"43321","Pandora",2013-09-07,5,"Gives me more of what I value... If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I have listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I have got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet."
"43322","Pandora",2017-01-06,5,"Favorite music Works great on the Kindle Fire. I love being able to choose music I enjoy and hearing music from my favorite genres."

It sucks that even if you pay you still have a limited number of skips. BUT, it does have some of the best variety of music of the streaming apps. I use it when I just need background music going. Google Play Music All-Access is a much better alternative, but you have to fork over dollar 9.99/month for that so its not for everybody."
"43358","Pandora",2013-01-17,5,"Great Product I always listen to music thru Pandora and will continue to do so. I would not mind a feature that would let me repeat a song I would like to hear over again."
"43359","Pandora",2014-04-14,5,"Awsome...wife loves this! I am one of the first subscribers of Sirius satellite radio within the first year of it starting. Pandora is probably going to be my new paid service. I can play and listen to pretty much everything I want too. Sirius has kind of become just like the free radio stations. If and when Howard Stern leaves I will probably get rid of my subscription but even then Howard seems like he is just phoning in his show so I am really thinking about cancelling my subscription with Sirius and going with Pandora."

It makes me think I do not need to buy cds anymore! When I want to hear one kind of music I choose that category, but I usually enjoy the mix. You can even customize the categories you choose so it is more suited to your own personal tastes. I have added and subtracted specific artists or songs from the categories, so it is really what I enjoy!"

"43398","Pandora",2013-08-28,4,"One Tiny Thing This app is great. When I first heard about it, I downloaded it onto my Fire right away. But, it seems to lag my Kindle a lot when I use it, so I give it a 4 star rating."

"43413","Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"The longer you have it the better it gets I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the dollar 4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."

Any station you can think of, Pandora has it!! It is not like a real broadcast radio station, but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits, all that station plays is today's hits! If you do not have the paid version 4 dollars a month however, it has some ads. Oh, and another thing. You will get a lot ofE-mails telling you what songs you like they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons, one is Like, one is Dislike-automatically skips song- skip, and pause and what new songs are for the season. I like the e-mails, however, even if you hate e-mails. Well, I do not have the paid version, and I think it is amazing! Seriously, get the app! No station limit, no anything but songs of your choice and a couple ads."

"43546","Pandora",2013-09-12,5,"I didnt use it because of the quality when your not subscribed, works amazing though I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I do not want to use it because I do not have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
"43547","Pandora",2015-07-05,4,"Love Pandora! We use Pandora all the time and have for years. Fantastic music service, creates play lists based on a favorite song, artist, genre. You can improve listening experience by personalizing tastes with likes and do not likes. Would give 5 stars back before there were ads! happy"
"43551","Pandora",2017-07-31,5,"If you dont have Pandora you are missing out. Pandora is by far the best music app out there. It has music that none if the other apps do. My favorite is hair bands. I love Pandora!"
"43557","Pandora",2015-12-22,3,"Too many commercials. While Pandora is nice, the free version plays a hundred times more ads than Spotify. Spotify also offers full minute commercials and then plays for half an hour. I do like how I can filter out explicit content, which is something I cannot do on Spotify."
"43570","Pandora",2017-09-05,5,"I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it. Live in a rural community with few stations and few options.I selected my last phone because it plays Pandora so well."
"43571","Pandora",2014-06-14,3,"Music player I installed the app on my pc, phone and tablet at the same time. I checked to see if they were working by playing them. No way to turn the app off , you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing. I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!! Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices. A good little fix would be a stop button on the App. Oh by the way I am a paying customer!"
"43572","Pandora",2014-07-12,4,"Almost 5 stars - but my station gets invaded frequently with offensive music I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually but not always get music I enjoy.That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the at number dollar * and ^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
"43575","Pandora",2015-01-26,4,"like, not love I like pandora. It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations. Only problem: it can play really cool songs, and it can play really, really bad songs that you will not know why pandora thought you would like. Overall though, it is pretty cool."

"43585","Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"I love, love I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
"43591","Pandora",2014-02-13,5,"I like my Pandora This is a great app that you can configure to your style. You can thumbs up, or thumbs down songs to inform them of what music that you prefer. You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle.Hope that helps."
"43592","Pandora",2017-09-18,5,"Five Stars Still my favorite music app."

"43599","Pandora",2015-01-23,5,"Pandora is wonderful! Pandora is wonderful! I can listen to my favorite categories of music across multiple devices easily. The free service only has advertisements every 20 minutes - much better than other audio broadcast venues! If that is still too much, they offer a subscription service which eliminates all ads. Pretty cool!"
"43600","Pandora",2012-11-07,5,"Does what I have always wanted to do with my music This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens. It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."

"43617","Pandora",2014-02-14,4,"Great to use on my Kindle I do love Pandora but do have an issue with them. I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa you get my drift.. so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I am being picky but it does get annoying when 4 times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."

"43621","Pandora",2014-04-02,5,"Where can I find my jazz -Pandora I love jazz and cannot tolerate rap and hip hop. Pandora has every genre of music from country to opera. I listen to John Coltrane, Michael Buble and an ocassional Fleetwood Mac and Elton John if I feel like it.

Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous. The user interface is good and easy to figure out. The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately. For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations. But other than that, it works like a charm. I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music."

"43677","Pandora",2014-03-22,3,"Not bad for free. I like Pandora because it seems to be a smarter program than most. When I type in an artists it does a pretty good job of giving me things I would/could like. The downsides are that it does not seem to reach out into the realm of eccentricity and expose me to new artists as much as I would like AND you can not choose specific songs to listen to or build stations from."

However, I went back to the free version and I was not even able to go on their website and activate the premium version.

I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay dollar 4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and does not have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer.

Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again.

"43737","Pandora",2013-08-11,5,"Pandora I love Pandora. I have to say I like it better than any other music source. One can 'make' a radio station and listen to just the music you want. Anything you do not like, give it a thumbs down and you do not hear it again. After a period of time, it is all the stuff one likes to hear. Did I say I love it? Also have it on all 4 computers as well as my cell phone. It do not get any better. Life is good!"

"43756","Pandora",2012-11-26,5,"Pandora is awesome. In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and do not have to sit through a few songs I do not particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible."
"43758","Pandora",2014-04-29,5,"Pandora Review I recently was given a Kindle Fire for my birthday and it had Pandora already loaded on it. Since January, I have been listening to so much GREAT music. I can personalize it many ways according to mood, time of day, etc. The selections that come forth are brilliant and I love the notion of having music at my fingertips whenever I want. Well done, Pandora!!"
"43760","Pandora",2016-10-31,5,"Great. Great."
"43761","Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"Glitch? I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up not playing them they just pop-up and do not stop until I close the app. I do not know if it is just my kindle or the app."
"43771","Pandora",2016-02-25,5,"Love it My math teacher puts on pandora during a test and I asked if it would work on my kindle and yet it did so now I use it almost everywhere I go such as shower, before bed, while I am reading etc.Just one of the best music apps I have ever had"
"43781","Pandora",2013-12-27,5,"Amazing breadth of music. I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer. I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it would not take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up. Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound. I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour. I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to design a station."
"43783","Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"I love it. I really like how you can type ... I love it. I really like how you can type in an artist's name and hear their music and music similar to that artist. Also you can change artist at will."
"43784","Pandora",2014-04-01,5,"Superi-ear! it is free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it is free. Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can not do that on the radio and it is still free. I love Pandora. The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."
"43786","Pandora",2016-12-14,5,"Enjoy Pandora Pandora is fantastic. The music selection for each station is so enjoyable and creative. Listening to Pandora is loaded with pleasure."
"43797","Pandora",2013-09-11,5,"Love it I am a music lover music makes me feel better when I am mad happy sad and so and I love to listen to music when I do homework or I am cleaning or when I am bored and this app helps me listen to all my favorite songs for free I love how I can type in an artist like one direction or katy Perry and other artist I love this app and works really good so I love it very much it is awesome and that is why I would give it ten stars ifi could and take it from a teenage music lover I love this app"
"43799","Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Make your own stations. We love making our own stations - like Disney for the kids. This way, they can listen to all the music from their favorite movies. Plus, mom and dad can have a station too. As many as you want with different genres. We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV. it is a win-win when cleaning the house or just wanting some peaceful background music."
"43800","Pandora",2015-09-02,5,"A Great Investment Free Pandora is awesome but you have commercials every Five or six songs. that is okay because it is free. You can pay and get no commercials. I have found some amazing bands that I would have never known existed. Thanks"

"43813","Pandora",2016-01-23,4,"This is my view for Pandora Pandora is a great app....when I am away from the Internet then the song's stops playing .....then I have to switch to a different app called Headphones Google play music. ...when the data comes on. ...the play music app works with Internet and without. .."
"43815","Pandora",2013-05-14,5,"If you want to hear your music you will love Pandora Pandora is free if you do not mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and do not like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations."
"43816","Pandora",2015-01-01,2,"Pandora often over promises and under delivers. Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works. If you want something more eclectic, not so hot. Or perhaps they are targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics. The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format. there is just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll. Of course, you can skip the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your skip quotient with the free version. Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters. I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with stations I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora. Do have to say that their Rockin Holidays Radio station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that gets it. Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."
"43817","Pandora",2017-06-15,5,"Ready set listen Wonderful!!"
"43819","Pandora",2017-04-20,5,"Love it love it"
"43820","Pandora",2013-10-02,5,"Best Music Radio App I have been using Pandora for years and I have I on all my devices, my Optimus and iPad. I have tried other music app as well, but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they have made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they are released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some your own selections of songs, you will love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. there is no way you will be disappointed with it."
"43829","Pandora",2012-11-20,5,"I LOVE IT!!!!! I love Pandora! its my favoriot and most visited app. the only problem is you can only skip 6 times."
"43833","Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"I do not know how I lived without it Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It is not perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you do not want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For dollar 36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you mostly love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!"
"43834","Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Pandora in my vehicle, nice. Have Pandora on Kindle Fire and PC, just added to cell phone to connect via Bluetooth with different vehicle. Works great."
"43836","Pandora",2015-08-02,2,"Great Station if you Like South American Music besides American Music. Being from Europe I was disappointed, Spotify Music App. Has every music you will love, from every country. Pandora is for not for a European American, like me. I like different stations, I do listen to American Music, Pandora has also South American Music, which is not for me."
"43843","Pandora",2016-07-27,4,"I hate commercials. A few commercials. They need a replay button so you can listen to a song more than once. They claim they can not do that."
"43845","Pandora",2017-09-21,5,"Affordable streaming Music Great app. Affordable and always plays nice selections from whatever I make up. Nice!"
"43852","Pandora",2013-03-17,2,"do not bother with phone app!!! Read below for a great desktop trick. Used to be the shizzle for the phone. Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream. WTF? And to boot, they are now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month. I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc. 40 hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads. You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review. On the pc you do not experience the above issues however, there is still a lot of ads. UNLESS . . . you know a trick, like I do. And yes, it is completely legal.For your home pc, Google Adam Haile Elpis . Click on the first hit. Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora. In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora. Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things. 1- it allows you to have unlimited skips. 2- it will not download any ads. In other words, it simulates the pay service.you are WELCOME!!!"

"43857","Pandora",2014-11-28,5,"How did I live without it all my life? Gotta love pandora. Like a dream come true right? Create your own stations based on your own favorite songs.

"43862","Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"Pandora is the best Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear.

You can not beat this service and best of all it is free."

The reason I am giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that is why its amazing but if you do not like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that is not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app."
"43888","Pandora",2016-09-11,5,"Great! Great app for listening to music with! Just wish that there was more skips available. But, none the less great variety, and app!!"

"43904","Pandora",2013-10-18,4,"Fun Radio is here! I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to. I particularly enjoy being able to put in the artist or song and up it pops, though I get bored pretty quickly when the same type of music keeps coming. Still, it is a must have for those who enjoy 'listening' to radio!"
"43906","Pandora",2017-08-01,5,"Five Stars Nice music, control your channel"
"43907","Pandora",2014-01-04,3,"3 Stars I think the concept of Pandora is great, but I would like to have information about maneuvering through and being able to make it work for me. Where do you find instructions?"
"43911","Pandora",2013-01-08,5,"Pandora I love Pandora!! You can build your own stations, for example 70's music and then have the opportunity to like or dislike each song. This allows Pandora to find more songs that it thinks you will like and has given me back songs from my childhood, plus new favorites. Also, it allows you to listen to comediannes and then supplies you with others with the same type of humor, which allows you to discover new comics. THANK YOU!!"

Now if I can just figure out how to get it on my car radio, instead of Sirius.They had special 4th of July channels of various types. I loved the Classical one.For everyday listening, I like the different channels in my genre. The SHUFFLE feature is excellent, so you do not get bored listening to just one album."
"43933","Pandora",2015-12-23,1,"I HAVE TO SHUT MY KINDLE DOWN If it was possible I would give this no stars. I have had to shut down my kindle at least seven times in the last hour because I dared to use this poorly designed app. My kindle screen does not work when I have used this app. It comes up blank but the music continues to play. I used this app with my old kindle and experienced similar problems. I thought it was the kindle, but clearly there is an issue with the app. PLEASE FIX IT. I love Pandora radio but I will not be using it until the issue is solved."
"43935","Pandora",2014-06-14,5,"Pandora radio I find it easy to use and that is saying a lot with me. I am not a high tech kind of girl so I things simple.

"43936","Pandora",2015-09-16,5,"It is easy to select different programming Have listened to Pandora for several years on my computer, so decided to add it to my cell phone. It is easy to select different programming. I like that it tells the song, performer, and more information. I am a real fan."

Therefore, I am back to the 4 stars that this great APP deserves."
"43967","Pandora",2014-01-21,5,"it is like your own personal radio station I love Pandora, great variety and super easy to set up stations. You can have multiple based on different types of music or mix all kinds of music together into one station. It is easy to change around stations as well just by adding new artists to the starting list for that station. Great to have on as background for work."

"43993","Pandora",2012-06-03,5,"A radio station all your own, for the cost of bandwidth! Sometimes I am in the mood for World, or George Winston-type New Age piano, or broader New Age stuff. So those are my current formats on Pandora! Followers can listen in, too. I do not mean Facebook; Pandora has their own system. Pandora's computers play stuff for you based on your initial stated preference of artist or song each time you are in the mood for something you haven't been listening to on Pandora yet. And you are able to vote each song up or down, or to skip the current piece. it is basically an interactive music collection, vastly larger than the records or tapes or discs you could or would store at home. OTOH it does not make you assemble and buy song by song like for your own iPod® either. they have scientifically analyzed recorded music based on elements like tempo, culture, mood, rhythm, instrumentation, even key, time signature, etc., and base their choices for you on the characteristics contained in your first choice, as well as on your subsequent votes. They really want your votes too. If you go too long without voting, they will stop and post a notice making sure you are still listening, and remind you they can not afford playing to an empty room !The free service includes audio and even video commercials, even ones local to your market. I do not usually mind, in fact, as an old radio hand, I like how stop-sets break it up a little, especially in the absence of DJs or news. Some ads are targeted for your gender, too. But I heard a political ad recently, which I felt violated the mood. Also, sometimes songs or ads get cut off. And they do warn you this can chew up alot of your monthly MBs or GBs. You can pay to stop the ads and improve sound quality even more than what I find perfectly adequate for my laptop or tablet speakers, currently dollar 36US/year IIRC, and I might do that, as this US election year promises/threatens to carpet-bomb us with ads of the worst kind yet.If your screen is big enough they also send, with each song as it is playing, album art, artist information if available, and the scientific reasons why they think this song fits your format though I am not sure headnodic is a word!!. So I have learned a lot about music I have always wondered about... without the financial pain of buying discs or songs blindly.One thing you can not do is request *by* format or scientific characteristic. I am part Native American, but city-raised, so I just typed that into the box; but if you do not know an artist or song title, the system can not help you.You can also get the service through ..., without this app, but I do not know how that would work out on a smaller device.Long story short, this may be the future of music radio -- narrowcasting, even self-help."
"44000","Pandora",2014-05-12,4,"Requires time I have been thumbing up and down songs for five years now. Once you have spent time culling through the collection, it becomes a wonderful radio station that plays 90 percent of just what you like. Until you have put in that amount of time, it will play totally random stuff that has nothing to do with the song seeds you started with."
"44001","Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"it is just great. Perfect music selections it is just great. Perfect music selections. Easy to use."
"44002","Pandora",2016-05-14,5,"I love Pandora! Pandora enables me to stream a huge variety of music genres on my Bose system at home and on the go on my mobile devices.

"44003","Pandora",2014-07-16,5,"Pandora Rocks! I even subscribed to the Pandora one over Sirius. dollar 4.99 for Pandora, over dollar 15.00 for Sirius per month. I do not like Howard Stern that much. I like to be able to skip a song if I do not like it, but do not like that this option is limited per day. Got it because my motorcycle radio's reception sucks. Crystal clear and integrates with my motorcycle radio from my iphone through a simple FM transmitter."

"44023","Pandora",2014-02-22,5,"Pandora is the cats meow. Pandora is my standby go-to app for online streaming. I love being able to read about the artists, and the 'similar artists' while listening. Your stations become more personalized with time as you click the Like / Dislike buttons. Its not the only game in town and it does not do offline saving/listening, but what it does, it does good."
"44034","Pandora",2014-12-26,1,"Too time consuming. In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be tuned in. To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate."
"44037","Pandora",2014-04-13,5,"Love Pandora I have been using Pandora for many years. I have created many of my own stations and added a lot of preset type stations from them. If you do not like what is on one station you will almost certainly find something on another. I use the free version but if you do listen a lot like my daughter, you might like the yearly or monthly subscription."

"44056","Pandora",2015-04-13,5,"Great way to listen; the ads of free Pandora are no bother to me Whether on smart TV menus, bluray players or ROKU/Amazon Fire TV or even cell phones/tablets, where I have it but do not use it it works well-and I have found some artists I did not know about on various similar channels that I have set up."

"44088","Pandora",2015-02-24,4,"Awesome I love the Pandora app, it performs wonderfully on my kindle fire hd. I would love it even more if you could give songs a thumbs up/down when you swipe down from the top. I tend to listen to Pandora while browsing the web or playing games on my kindle so it makes it hard to go back and forth; it would be so much more efficient with that feature."
"44089","Pandora",2012-05-18,5,"Music your way. This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as Beatles . You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I do not know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you did not know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc. without having to recreate them. If you are a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet."

"44140","Pandora",2012-04-01,5,"Reliable, good interface, and good quality Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned, I have nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I have experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strengthThe interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an i, which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. it is not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."

"44150","Pandora",2011-11-17,4,"Good Internet Radio App - Recommended This is one of the most used apps on my Android phone and tablet, providing streaming music to my device.

They always get in the way, and as soon as I touch the screen, bam there is another one that covers the whole page. It gets annoying, and you have to pay like 3.99 a month just for no ads. Ridiculous. So yeah this app is better on a tablet or a phone with a huge screen so it does not cover the whole screen...but otherwise it is awesome. does not really lag unless it is having a bad day...Galaxy Express i437"
"44174","Pandora",2012-01-16,5,"Would be five stars but for one feature Updated:loses a star! Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web. This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already do not like Pandora for whatever reason, you are not going to like the app, obviously.Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle. Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the QuickMix station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser. Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars! Way to go, it is about time!"
"44176","Pandora",2017-07-28,5,"Five Stars Great music at no cost."
"44177","Pandora",2012-01-20,4,"for those with probs if you had trouble changing the stationon the Kiele fire then try go down below to where the home botton is and hit the botton in the middle with lines or the one that looks like a list and it will give you options. just play around with it and you will find it, or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton. now yes there are advertisements that play after 3-4 songs but the only way Pandora will be free is if they do those advertisements. they only last about 30 seconds. i have left my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora playing and it did not die. if you leave it playing but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play letting you save more battery power.Pandora is not good nor bad it just depeneds if you really want to PAY for the best servise. if you want free music of your choice on you kendle fire then maybe it is not so bad, but if you want the best then sure you can buy it."

"44180","Pandora",2012-08-29,4,"Pandora This is a great application made for those that already use Pandora radio. It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.Problems you will find if you use the free version of Pandora:-The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open.-You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.*EDIT*-It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music. You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment.^ This is now possible. They have fixed it and made the application even better.My qualms with the application, but it is good nonetheless."

"44215","Pandora",2015-01-30,4,"Good, but not great The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app is not quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting."

It has commercials however, I am not turned off by that one bit. I will keep listening and submit a 30 day follow-up review to complete my initial exposure to this type of media."
"44223","Pandora",2016-04-17,3,"Not the worst music player but... Regardless of if my headphones work of not- and regardless of my internet- the music cuts out and will skip at random, although the ads work just fine. However the selection of music is very nice and varied."

"44250","Pandora",2014-12-30,2,"it is now mostly ads with the occasional tune that does not crash. I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says Pandora can not find any more music, try changing channels on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it is recently become totally unusable as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it is it is same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."
"44254","Pandora",2017-04-28,4,"Got to love it My kind of music when i want it"

"44262","Pandora",2013-12-30,1,"FREE: HALF TRUE I loved the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you have ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I do not have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that is an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again for free I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was free and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a solution that would allow someone who had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I do not wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who do not use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information. it is a shame we could not work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."

"44429","Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Music lovers library Pandora is a wonderful way to hear the music YOU like. Whether it be a particular style or by a particular artist. It even gives you other music similar to the favorites you pick.

That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome."

Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can not pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and authorsput you can not pick the song. Pandora does not have station either, which I am thankful for."

I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire. It is a nice way listen to music when you are connected to Wi-Fi."

"44691","Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Very happy It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around. I less frequently listen to my recorded music now. The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service. Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker. Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
"44692","Pandora",2014-04-25,5,"Personal heart-warming radio station Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear. By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, or group of artists - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre. Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves. Best of all it is free."

"44713","Pandora",2013-10-14,5,"Music to go. Pandora creates stations of music similar to any artist you submit. Peter Gabriel for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting. This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet. It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials."

Pay a piddling amount for a year of commercial-free Pandora and help the company stay afloat. you will also get a great-quality stream. The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that a they can not find the advertisers and b they haven't burned through their capital yet. Meanwhile, NOBODY beats Pandora's Music Genome algorhythm at sussing out new music you will love. they are easily best in breed. FIVE STARS. Try it and if you love it but hate the ads, pay the piper. You will not be sorry."

"44899","Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"awesome just pure awesome I love this app! After you have made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle which I love and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"

"44902","Pandora",2013-06-30,4,"The best of the streaming music apps I have used Google Play, Music 365, IHeart Radio and Pandora, and I have to give the overall nod to Pandora, even with the ads. If you are looking for stations that actually play the artists you want assuming that they have a moderately substantial catalog of at least 30 songs to their credit, you have to use Pandora.

I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT. I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it two stars. However, I will NOT have any application that includes advertising that is this intrusive on my Kindle."

"44944","Pandora",2017-01-20,5,"Padora on BlackBerry Passport - great sound Works very well. Nice in a private setting with friends with no interrupted moments. Best when in the car and there is a really limited choice of music stations."
"44948","Pandora",2013-04-08,5,"Makes a noisy workplace less distracting I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me. Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi."
"44949","Pandora",2013-11-16,5,"Great music APP. Excellent source for a variety of music. I enjoy playing Pandora music from different artists. I use it to play in my car radio and at home on a bluetooth speaker."

"44963","Pandora",2015-04-15,5,"I love Pandora!!! It is so great when I can turn on Pandora and go to a station that plays only songs that I want to here, this app has a station for everyone even people who like to listen to instrumental where it is just like a brass symphony or brass set. This app is for everyone!!"
"44965","Pandora",2017-06-19,5,"Five Stars Love the App. Hearing music I like and being able to fine tune the list is perfect."
"44968","Pandora",2014-07-14,3,"okay, but... Sure it plays some music you actually want to listen to, but everything else you do not want it to play comes in abundance! so please make it more careful! so many artists I haven't even heard of pop up! I want it to stop!please!"
"44972","Pandora",2012-03-10,3,"Great but has some sensoring and advertisement problems okay this app is totally pimped out but I mean come on! This app does not play sensored music, so its not great for kids under 13. But the app itself is amazing and you can create your own station and listen to that genre. But there is also another problem, the advertisements are outta control! Who wants to listen to dating ads every other song???? It told me that I can upgrade to Pandora1 for 3.99 a month and I cant afford that. so just listen to this review!!!!!!!! FROBRO OUT!!!!!!!"
"44978","Pandora",2016-04-08,1,"Pandora not coming up For some reason every time I try to open this app up it automatically shuts down. Tried reloading it several times still nothing. It has always perfectly up until today. I really like this app. What can I do to fix it?"
"44982","Pandora",2015-08-10,5,"PANDORA...Great, right out of the box! I really like Pandora. It never fails to offer the types of music and entertainers I like. I can choose jazz, classical, classic rock and roll, gospel, or any type I want. Or, I can choose anyone from Michael Buble to Arrowsmith! it is a wonderful place to escape or have as a companion while working at the computer."
"44985","Pandora",2017-01-20,5,"Pretty necessary for your Fire I am a music junkie so this was a no brainer for an app to add to my Fire tablet. It gives me the variety between the Prime music and Pandora stations. I bluetooth the audio to a Motorola Sol speaker."
"44986","Pandora",2016-12-13,5,"but otherwise very pleased with the app Sadly, my kindle does not have the same adblock features my laptop does, so I get the pandora ads, but otherwise very pleased with the app."
"44987","Pandora",2012-12-28,5,"I LOVE IT I have been using Pandora for probably 6 yrs now and upgraded to the premium edition after only a couple of months. It is my main music source. I recommend it to everyone. I just got a Kindle Fire for Christmas so now I can take Pandora with me."
"44988","Pandora",2016-03-01,4,"too much to get in what is with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it is like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that is too hard to do while I am driving. HATE IT!!"

"45000","Pandora",2014-03-05,4,"Viola! Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served.Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions band name/song that you give it. it is awesome, and super customizable. Best thing is it is a radio station. it is a different constant mix up.also, stick your phone/ tablet in a ceramic or metal bowl. speakers "
"45006","Pandora",2013-09-04,5,"Music I can listen to and words I can understand it is good to be able to reach back to the vocalists and musicians of the 40s and further. Particularly the composers and lyricists who wrote for them. I especially love the jazz sounds of the smaller combos as well as the rhythms behind the likes of Clooney, Christie, etc., etc.."
"45011","Pandora",2017-10-17,5,"Five Stars Easy to setup your favorite stations"

"45017","Pandora",2013-07-31,4,"Great App I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you do not like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.it is great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app."
"45018","Pandora",2017-08-05,5,"Pandora Great"

"45032","Pandora",2015-09-13,5,"Enjoy! The app mirrors my smart phone and iPad apps which I thoroughly enjoy. Being able to customize the apply for my listening tastes is excellent. The free version does not have excessive advertisements. Enjoy! PS: Be mindful that the app uses data in the smart phone when used away from WiFi."
"45033","Pandora",2016-02-13,1,"will not Play Music! The app will not play music! It will play a single song, and then will stop playing. It wil show the next song, but will not let me hit play, skip, etc. I love Pandora, but will have to listen to music elsewhere if the app does not even work!"
"45039","Pandora",2013-07-15,5,"Music.... I have a couple of music downloads, and I perfer Pandora. Free version still will not let you forward past songs as much as you would like..."

"45068","Pandora",2012-08-02,4,"I am in love BUT Ok I am 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me. Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire. I love it. I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist. And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again. It remembers. The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder. The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing. Sometimes I do not want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc. I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."
"45073","Pandora",2016-12-15,5,"Pandora is great It has all the songs I remember from great ... Pandora is great It has all the songs I remember from great times gone by. Thanks for the memories."
"45074","Pandora",2017-01-18,5,"Variety and navigable. I enjoy the variety of artists and music. Depending on the venue and activity my music tastes vary. The app is easy to navigate."
"45075","Pandora",2014-03-07,5,"PANDORA ROCKS Pandora gives me a choice to what music I want to listen to all the time. Whether old school or new releases.To have freedom to listen to what I want when I want and where I want 5 stars is not enough."
"45076","Pandora",2016-11-08,5,"Five Stars Cool."
"45080","Pandora",2013-11-15,3,"Love it for the most part - BUT having trouble viewing movies due to network problems. We like it because we do not have cable... the free shipping is great. But have had some trouble with the network in watching the movies."

"45086","Pandora",2017-05-23,5,"Five Stars Love it, wish I could get complete albums on it"
"45089","Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Five Stars I enjoy listening to all the old classic music without having to download it"
"45091","Pandora",2013-01-29,5,"Love this service! Wherever you use Pandora, you gotta use it! I do not pay for the service, so I have to suffer through the ads. But, what it has done is suggest several different musicians to me that I would never have thought of. I then promptly go to Amazon and buy the CD after listening to a few track samples of course. It is a great way to find out what is out there!"
"45092","Pandora",2015-02-09,3,"Ok... It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it does not have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."
"45094","Pandora",2017-09-08,5,"Five Stars Great! happy"
"45100","Pandora",2016-05-29,5,"Fantastic, enjoyable Fantastic, enjoyable, can choose any artist I want, I downloaded it on my kindle and go outtside when I do my gardening and its so peaceful and what a pleasure it is to listen too. Sincerely Marie"
"45104","Pandora",2017-11-11,2,"do not like new update! I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!"
"45112","Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"Five Stars Best way to listen to music ever!!"
"45114","Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Great!! Love music therefore this is a perfect product for me."

I entered my favorite band and here I am rockin' like crazy! Great music, very limited publicity thank God, fantastic selection! Thank you Pandora and keep on rockin'!! Who needs to buy music anymore! Not me! You had me at the first song!"
"45121","Pandora",2016-07-20,5,"latina I luv it. There r such different music genres to choose from. Literally its great. Im happy because being hispanic, its hard getting mjsic that i like such as reggaeton. I appreciate it, and im sure u will too. Get it. Trust me...u wont regret it"
"45126","Pandora",2013-09-04,4,"Music to sweat by ! Pandora is great for the gym. I can listen to all types of music and it makes my workout go by faster and more enjoyable."
"45131","Pandora",2012-12-21,5,"Love this app on any device I love this app on any device. It is so nice to listen to all the music you want to and it still has way less ads than listening to a radio."
"45137","Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"Great music choice works fine on Kindle Fire Hd Pandora is great and it seems to learn my musical tastes the more I use it. works fine on Kindle fire hd."
"45141","Pandora",2015-05-15,4,"can not undo dislike? I like having a simple program for listening to random music. I prefer the Pandora algorithm over other services. But I accidentally disliked a song I actually like. can not find a way to undo this. Seems like an obvious option to me, but not included."
"45142","Pandora",2013-08-30,5,"STUPENDOUS!!! Pandora is to die for!!!! I have never loved any music service as much as I love Pandora. I have extremely eclectic tastes in music and there is always something I can find on Pandora to suit my mood. Kudos to Pandora for being so intelligent. Their info pages are great. Keep up the good work!"
"45148","Pandora",2012-01-13,4,"Pandora fan for years now I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it is great.Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they have gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."
"45149","Pandora",2014-03-23,5,"awsome I love Pandora my teacher played Pandora on Friday we danced because we did every thing we had to do than my mom bought me a Kindle fire HD for my birthday so I downloaded Pandora it works perfectly and you can listen to new music from the station you know. I used to did not like Taylor swift but now I LOVE her music Great app download it and you will see."
"45151","Pandora",2015-03-22,5,"Eyeintheskky Love the the vatriety of music. The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you do not like. Great way to match music to individual tastes. Kudos Pandora!"
"45156","Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"love pandora I love my Pandora app. It let us me customize my stations, and I get to choose my station. It would be nice to have more than five skips an hour"
"45161","Pandora",2017-04-08,5,"😏😏😏😏😏😏😏 Pretty great!!"
"45171","Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"My 3rd most used App. I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes."
"45174","Pandora",2015-01-29,4,"Four Stars works as specified ..."
"45176","Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"song options and lists I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back toThe songs that you just listened to. Also I do not like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"
"45177","Pandora",2015-07-26,2,"tablet/kindle problems I love pandora but I have recently been having trouble getting into it on both my tablet and kindle. I end up having to uninstall and reinstalling the app in order for it to work. no problems on my desktop, tho."
"45185","Pandora",2016-09-26,5,"Good music it goes off music u like so it is ... Good music it goes off music u like so it is like a personal dj n has different stations like u can have a workout station and a diveing station or a hype mix"
"45189","Pandora",2013-10-30,2,"Annoying, Incessant Ads and Continual Upgrade Harassment Free is a relative term. What price is free dom? In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every 2 seconds. The curse, if you do not upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they would only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the 2nd star. We each have different patience levels. You have to decide what you are willing to put up with ad-wise for the free app. Just know what you are getting into."
"45190","Pandora",2014-06-21,5,"YOUR kind of music application! The ONLY choice for my diversity of choice. Really enjoy being able to find whatever kind of music I am in the mood for. And free! Being on Social Security Disability does not allow for a lot of extras. With Pandora, I can find whatever I want and listen to it for free. do not mind the commercials, they have to pay for their station of incredible choices somehow!"

"45199","Pandora",2012-11-06,5,"charlie this is a good app because if you want to listen to music on the radio than here you go. if you know a song but cant remember the name of it it tells you and you can write it down like I do.when I could not remember a song I ask my cousin and she told me the name of the band but not the song. so now I get the band and the song.well I hope you lin it and remember if I reviewed it it means it good.bye y'all."

After using it for several months, I decided I would leave a review because I base most of my purchases on others' reviews as well.I use Pandora on my PC, and the Pandora app has not let me down on my Kindle. it is free, feels like the website, and runs in the background while I read a book or surf the web. I would say this is a must-have app!"

"45209","Pandora",2014-10-16,5,"love Pandora Pandora is awesome and amazing. It has all the music, station, and artists you want. And you get to rate the song thumb up or thumb down.

I can hear whatever music I am in the mood for, from classical to Supertramp, to Sade, to Fun., and whatever similar artists and songs that Pandora pulls.

"45228","Pandora",2015-08-15,4,"what is up? Love the app. Recently there was an update to kindle and since a lot of issues. At least there is music playing again. But now my kindle keeps deleting the app. I have to re download almost daily."

"45399","Pandora",2013-06-17,5,"Pandora Pandora is the greatest invention since FM radio. Rather than choosing a station based on what kind of music you like you now choose an artist you are in the mood to listen to and it never fails to satisfy. I love 80's hair bands for working out, jack Johnson for cooking, Chris daughtry for working and Abba by the pool."
"45402","Pandora",2012-12-12,5,"why are there so many complaints? I love Pandora and not just cuz I am 11I did not change the User name it gives a great verity and when I like songs, it remembers and plays them again it learns what you like. plus, I do not even see slacker radio on the top free section. so tut should prove that Pandora is better than slacker.even though ive never listened to slacker"
"45406","Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Five Stars It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"

Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great! I Would Rate It Four Stars Instead Of Five Just Because Of The Issue With Skipping The Track Only Six Times."

"45432","Pandora",2013-06-13,5,"Its good times...whar more can you say! As a past subscriber to XM Radio I was looking for a substitute for less cost. XM is just too much money unless you travel alot. Pandora fills the spot nicely. Its good on travel too if you have good internet service in your area of travel. I have not tried their premium service, but I am thinking about it."
"45435","Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Pandora is my favorite app out there. I have loved the Pandora radio for as long as it is been available. I would leave everything on my phone and just keep Pandora and be happy!"

But this is totally free, which is quite nice!"
"45459","Pandora",2016-07-14,4,"awesome Great, but can quickly use up data"
"45465","Pandora",2012-06-15,5,"Awesome!!!!!!! I love this app. very limited commercials. if you are planning to get I heart radio get this instead. one problem you may dislike though is the ads and you only can skip 6 times an hour. I like how you can skip like three times and it will play a different song. you also can go to a particular type of person. for example, you can go to the selena Gomez station."

"45488","Pandora",2013-08-07,3,"stop with the ads Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."

"45518","Pandora",2012-12-04,1,"Pandora's broken I really used to love this app but recent updates have made my kindle fire unstable and the ads have been regularly crashing the app. Also, the ads have become more frequent. I could probably deal with if they worked properly and music would resume after they finished. Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend this app."
"45522","Pandora",2012-10-11,5,"kerb I love this app, its the best internet radio on the internet! No other app gives you the amount of versatility that Pandora does, I love Christian music and no other radio gives u the amount of artists that I have found on Pandora! Very little amount of commercials. Thank you Pandora for giving us Free Radio that is the best!!!"

"45543","Pandora",2012-01-22,5,"Love it paid or free What can I say about Pandora. it is always been fair about paid and free subscriptions. The free version is a great marketing tactic. It keeps the name brand up and for those that pay like I have in the past, it is awesome with awesome features. I am currently running the free one again due to finances but I still enjoy the great service Pandora has to offer."
"45546","Pandora",2017-08-10,5,"Nice Nice"

"45600","Pandora",2014-06-19,1,"waste of time adding my account and sucks It has to much advertising and you have to pay 0.99 and I cant even get a Amazon gift card and you do not select any songs and I tap the play button 20 times and no song plays this is why Pandora sucks"

"45701","Pandora",2011-12-29,4,"Love it!!! This app is the best for music. The options on the type of stations you want to listen to and mix them is great. Ideal for a person who likes a variety of music. Only 2 downsides is that you will be listening all day while you are supposed to be doing something else and the commercials, but it is overall fantastic."
"45702","Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Amazing I think this is the best way to listen to music. You could have all the songs you want but on phones people by there favorite music when you can get it free right on Pandora. In my opinion I think it is amazing!"

"45711","Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"loved it till recently. plays one song and freezes. i have to quit close app and reopen....just to hear one song and Repeat! Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution."

"45731","Pandora",2013-05-26,5,"LISTEN UP! !!!! This is a good app but the app wont get you to your exact song. This app is not that organized but plays reallly good songs. This app allows you to skip up to 6 songs each station your on. This is a great music app I highly reccomend it."
"45733","Pandora",2017-08-06,1,"Pandora Did use this so cannot review."
"45736","Pandora",2012-12-27,5,"Spend a few dollars and get commercial free! Love Pandora! I splurged and spend the extra dollar 9.95 to get rid of the commercials and it was a very satisfying move!

This has recently happened; I listen to Pandora constantly, it is really great and has introduced me to a lot of new songs and artist, but now, everytime I listen to a particular station, it says no more songs can be played/found. I haven't had this issue before. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?"
"45756","Pandora",2012-02-20,5,"OMG The best. Even the free version is great. You barely notice the ads, and the commercials are few and far between and short. Just give it an idea of what you like thumbs up and it takes it. If you do not like a song, thumbs down, and it goes away. I actually turned off the Tv and started listening instead."
"45757","Pandora",2017-10-15,5,"great service - connected to my audio equipment for awesome sound, could live without ads but it is free so c'est la vie Love it!!!"

"45762","Pandora",2013-10-09,1,"Terrible recently I would give pandora 5 stars, it is an awesome way to listen to music, if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on, listen to one song, turn it off, and try again and it will not work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it, but I have used already this time? Shut down my kindle, and hope it works."

Do you guys realize that Pandora makes virtually no reasonable profit from providing this FREE service? Where else can you listen to the music of your choice for free? The radio? Come on people cut these guys some slack."
"45775","Pandora",2015-04-10,5,"Love it Pandora is fabulous. You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music. It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time."

Type in an artist and Pandora will play songs from them and others in the same gendre. The only complaint is the ads, and not being able to skip songs as much as I would like to sometimes."
"45790","Pandora",2017-09-21,4,"Four Stars Love this app."
"45791","Pandora",2014-01-11,5,"great music I like 90-95 percent of the music I hear, I think it is great, keep playing the good stuff. I really do not mind the commercialsbecause they allow you to get up and get a drink or something."

"45836","Pandora",2013-06-03,1,"40 Hour Listening Cap- ARE YOU CRAZY????? I used to LOVE Pandora! Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW. For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month. Are you for real?? With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU dollar 3.99??? Take a powder, Pandora!I started using RADITAZ, people!!! Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour. Even has a carosel for songs. So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio free version. Pandora must be INSANE!!"
"45837","Pandora",2016-05-12,5,"Five Stars Awesome"
"45842","Pandora",2013-11-22,1,"it sucks and its stupid here's why: it has really gross adds and it wont let me listen to the songs that I want to. SPOTIFY IS BETTER!!! It lets you get your favorite songs when you want it and its free, and it has cleaner adds than Pandora. GET SPOTIFY!!!"
"45844","Pandora",2014-03-26,5,"Love it Easy to use. My favorite music follows me everywhere. I would highly recommend Pandora for anyone who love music and wants to be able to access it anytime, anywhere."

"45849","Pandora",2014-12-22,5,"so great! absolutely love it! i play it all the time and when im not its all because of the internet. highly recommended!"
"45850","Pandora",2012-12-30,4,"Good but.... I have been using Pandora since I downloaded on my kindle fire and it does have good quality of music when it wants to play. It seems it recently has been fixed. hopefully no interruptions will occur again. I hate it when it forcloses."
"45857","Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Five Stars Love Pandora!"
"45859","Pandora",2012-07-16,4,"little problem I luv pandora! it used 2 work great on my kindle fire. but lately while music is playing its kinda staticy at some times and a few times completely skipped over a song. i dont know if theres a problem with my kindle or the app. besides that, its a great app!!"
"45867","Pandora",2013-11-05,4,"The new update I like the app. just after the last update I got it wont let me sign back. it just says it is having technical issues. to get on I have to uninstall the app and redownload it everytime."
"45868","Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best online music with a great app There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version. This app allows for both but if you do not have a subscription then expect commercials and popups. The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
"45870","Pandora",2016-02-22,4,"PrettyGood Too many ads though."
"45872","Pandora",2017-06-24,5,"Five Stars love it"
"45873","Pandora",2013-05-05,5,"AWESOME!! My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I reccomend this."
"45874","Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"its the best music app ever. do not waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app. its free also instead of paying"
"45875","Pandora",2014-09-08,1,"I found it hard to navigate and find a particular ... I found it hard to navigate and find a particular song. Also, I did not expect it to use data charges when I play it through the app on my car."
"45878","Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"Oh so sleazy. Where should I start. 1. The app only works 45 percent ofthe time - it force closes or drops a song. 2. They put banners over all the buttons so you cant like skip pause etc. Oh and get this; the close button on the ad does not work just sends you right to the advertiser's site. Bravo, Pandora."
"45881","Pandora",2013-08-19,1,"hmm This thing is not letting me listen to music !! I haven't been able to for like 2 weeks !! I am done, I am going to another music app !!"
"45886","Pandora",2011-10-24,3,"song choices are great. Ads played over the songs are not I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying. The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense. Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background."
"45892","Pandora",2012-12-17,1,"Ads are way too annoying! Sure its a free app, and I expect ads, but they are way too intrusive.And only having a limited number of song skips each hour is silly! Why should I have to listen to songs I do not like? Why do they even have that rule?"
"45893","Pandora",2012-06-13,4,"Nice n Dirty Love the radio.do not ever belive the 1or 2 star reviews cuz they are NOT true.All I know is that the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I want clean music but I got dirty music.But do not take my word for it.Lets just say its 100 percent free and a great radio."
"45900","Pandora",2013-08-13,1,"Horrible Customer Service Beware of using Pandora with a SmartTV, particularly if it is a Samsung. there is a known bug that forces you to unplug your television in order to exit the App. You should also know ahead of time that there is no telephone for Customer Service and that Customer Service available by E-Mail is neither expedient nor helpful.There are better music subscription choices."
"45903","Pandora",2013-08-21,2,"pabdora sux Pandora was ok when u were able 2 skip 6 times every hour but now they skimp u on skips and the lame comercials every othe song. I jst download my own music and not have 2 worry bout using it"

"45920","Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"Good app. Pretty good app, works well on my device. I took one point off because it tends to play the same artist too often even when I add plenty of other artists to a station with the artist in question being excluded from the list."
"45921","Pandora",2015-11-21,5,"LOVE IT. My favorite GO TO LOVE IT. My favorite GO TO!!!!!"

"45937","Pandora",2011-11-10,2,"Used to be good. I had to go back to an old version to just get it to work. Still very sketchy using that. Takes a minute to load the first song then twenty seconds to over a minute to play the next song. Do you call that quality? Because I do not. I have had better luck using Slacker. Droid X2"
"45942","Pandora",2014-02-19,5,"The Best Great concept, well thought out. Love being able to have control of different artitst and their genres of music. Love that you can mix things up. Kudos!"

"45958","Pandora",2012-02-27,2,"What a Shame I used to enjoy this app because it gave me a variety of music from the designated artist, genre, or composer. Soon, it started playing music that was not even related to the station. It is quite disappointing on Pandora's account."
"45961","Pandora",2014-12-11,5,"love pandora you should download Pandora I love how you can hear music for free if some one does not now about Pandora tell them"
"45962","Pandora",2013-09-05,5,"as expected Pandora keeps things simple and straight forward. It provides music to me at the low cost of one commercial every 15 minutes or so. A better deal than regular radio if you ask me."
"45964","Pandora",2012-06-19,5,"Perfect pandora keeps playing music until you pause it or shut the kindle down. perfect for all music needs. because of the feature that makes keep playing you can turn it the screen off to save power. also works while playing games. great application."

"46966","Pandora",2013-04-05,5,"the bass keeps dropping. this is the best app made for the kindle fire. I love radio only lets you have a daily amour of skips, while Pandora lets you have a certain amour per hour, on each channel. like I said, best app made for music/industrial manners."

"46977","Pandora",2011-10-24,2,"Not for me I did not really like the way Pandora chose music for me. I would try to get it to go more toward my genre, but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I was not interested in. It also set up stations too frequently.I ended up deleting Pandora, and will have to find another app which suits me more."
"46978","Pandora",2017-09-25,1,"One hit wonder I do not know what is going on lately but it will play one song then buffer for eternity. Very disappointing."

I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?"
"47010","Pandora",2012-07-20,5,"amazing I love the parody songs on the radio. this app is amazing. I love how they switch songs automatically..... yes."

"47251","Pandora",2017-04-16,4,"Awesome I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that is really annoying when it is one of my favorites... otherwise it is Amazing!!"

"47366","Pandora",2012-04-08,1,"wrong there is one one huge problem with this app and other than that I love it.it never plays the right song"
"47369","Pandora",2017-09-14,4,"Pandora I would rate it a five if I could get onto it. It will not let me open on my Fire. I would really like to hear my thumbprint radio."
"47372","Pandora",2012-09-19,1,"no, you may not email my mom ...and I can not imagine why anyone would let you. these permissions are insane. I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."
"47382","Pandora",2016-03-25,5,"cool,awesome,neat This is A-W-E-S-O-M-E. You can make your own music stations and they are unlimited. And you can Like and unlike. And you do not have to get more and more updates."
"47385","Pandora",2012-01-15,5,"best app ever this app is so useful and amazing it lets you listen to music you like .... its User friendly and an all around good time!!!!"
"47387","Pandora",2011-10-17,5,"I am would give it nine stars I would give this nine stars, just like the nine nine nine plan. The 999 plan replaces the tax code with the simple but effective 999 plan. Pandora is great because it shows you new artists like the ones you love"
"47388","Pandora",2013-01-06,5,"Great The music that the kids listen to these days can be used through this app but I would also like to use it one day."
"47390","Pandora",2012-01-09,1,"THIS app pissed me off!! I would choose a song and it would go to a different fricken band then I went the unistall Icon"
"47391","Pandora",2016-12-26,1,"A- Pandora you made playing songs to complicated! I can not play sucker for pain! It just keeps playing other songs pls add a search button The A- Will turn to a A plus if you add a play song button"
"47392","Pandora",2012-02-01,1,"kindles interference with ability of tablet This tablet is being changed to block my ability to access websites I prefer. I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone."
"47395","Pandora",2016-03-25,5,"Five Stars Works great I get all the music that I like"
"47396","Pandora",2016-04-10,3,"Great app, but... It exits the app after I listen to it for 30 to 45 minutes, I have to reopen and can not continue listening to the song that was playing before! If you fix this then I will gladly give a five star rating!"
"47398","Pandora",2017-06-10,5,"Numero uno! Use pandora every day. For driving to work, relaxing at home, partiea. Any day, every day, any time. Great app, wide selection!"
"47401","Pandora",2012-11-27,1,"too unstable The ad supported Kindle version just does not work reliably. Music stops and I hear nothing but am told that an ad is playing. And music does not return. Not much good in this form."
"47402","Pandora",2011-11-15,1,"Gone downhill I used to be a devoted Pandora user, but the app has been on a steady decline. Like other users, I have been having issues hearing complete songs. I have reported the issue and haven't seen any sign of a fix. While the occasional crash was okay, this consistent problem is SO frustrating. So I am gonna check out Slacker. Sorry Pandora, but your poor response to big problems has lost you another user."
"47403","Pandora",2016-07-22,1,"can not even sign in! When I enter a email it says its incorrect and I do not think a zip code should be used to login I wish I could rate it 0 stars I can not even sign in"
"47405","Pandora",2011-12-29,1,"NOT for kindle fire when first started using it, it was good, but the second time it was having problems. When I tried to open it I would just get stuck on the blue Pandora screen, so I reinstalled it only to get another problem. It would not let me find a new station so I only had the first station I looked for,the ice cube station. So I would not recommend this to anyone with the kindle fire."
"47419","Pandora",2016-05-04,5,"great!! Awesome app"
"47421","Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"spotify is great Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It does not limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let us you play whole albums and let us you make custom and endless playlists."
"47428","Spotify",2017-10-14,5,"Best Choice for Music Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!"
"47429","Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"Great app! I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to."

"47445","Spotify",2016-02-11,5,"The discover playlist is your answer for new music. I do not know what to say. I am a spotify fiend with a premium membership. I can hear anything I want and any songs that I happen to love, but the weekly discover playlist keeps me coming back because I am incapable of finding new music on my own."
"47454","Spotify",2014-10-15,4,"small bug otherwise great app there is a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it would not let me share to Facebook facebook specifically. I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. would not want an app that only has pop, rap and country sticking tongue out love it"
"47462","Spotify",2017-04-21,5,"Spotify perks Works very well on my tablet and even plays while I play a game. Spotify premium is even better because there are no commercials and that is the best."

"47508","Spotify",2017-03-28,5,"The best there is Tried all music apps. Saving an entire album for free is priceless even with shufflke on."
"47510","Spotify",2014-12-14,4,"very pleasant I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood. Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."
"47513","Spotify",2017-06-22,5,"it is Great I am excited to have Spotify and to be able to choose whatever music I am in the mood for! Thank you."
"47514","Spotify",2017-05-01,4,"I love Spotify. The only thing that can get a ... I love Spotify. The only thing that can get a little annoying is they do not have some songs on there.."
"47517","Spotify",2015-07-30,5,"Great for Kindle Fire HD for music in the background.... I use my Spotify app for all my music listening, now. Very little ads. Has every song I have ever searched for... including little known indie artists and big name bands. Highly recommend! You can also put this on your Kindle and the music will play in the background as you use it."
"47518","Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"spotify I love this app so much you can get so much free music, it is really crazy. They have such much music. They do not have Taylor swift though, which kind of sucks."
"47520","Spotify",2015-08-01,3,"great app for the most part I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99¢ for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I am in the car for example it says no internet connection and will not let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing."
"47521","Spotify",2017-09-06,4,"Four Stars I love how you can customize your list it not just a stations it is your music."
"47522","Spotify",2016-01-09,5,"the best music app so far I love spotify. 20 times better than Pandora. You can rewind, fast forward songs. Make lists.

"47546","Spotify",2016-05-20,5,"Love this free app Love this free app, there are tons of new music all the time. Been with spotty for acouple of years and have no complaints with them. If you want no ads there is a fee, but spotfy does not hound you about it."

"47553","Spotify",2015-08-13,5,"Great app for streaming your music... Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a dollar 9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind. This replaces all my long lost CD's and for a fraction of the price of buying songs individually. Five stars for the service and the app itself."

"47559","Spotify",2017-09-04,3,"Three Stars I had trouble using the product. I seldom tried to use it, and finally deleted it from my phone."

"47565","Spotify",2014-10-26,3,"Okay, I guess... Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can not play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."
"47569","Spotify",2017-02-01,5,"Spotify it is a really good app"
"47579","Spotify",2017-07-14,5,"Best app So far it is amazing I can listen to whatever I want even not on shuffle It is so good at hearing Harry styles and all the 1D songs and 1D people"
"47581","Spotify",2016-06-19,5,"Best Music App! I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash think of that what you may because I just went to emøtiønal røad shøw yesterday June 18, 2016 so hehe. But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you do not have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you are listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they will not play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic. I am awkward just get the app."

"47626","Spotify",2015-11-29,5,"Amazing Spotify is my absolute favourite app, it is just perfect. I believe that there may be a little bit too many commercials but it makes up for it in letting everyone free music to listen to. Overall an amazing app, would recommend it to anyone."

"47674","Spotify",2016-01-14,4,"Good it is a great app and has a variety of music, the only reason I did not rate it five stars is because about every three songs an add comes on asking you to get spotify premium, it sometimes even says it in the middle of the song!"
"47676","Spotify",2017-06-10,5,"Best music site ever! It was extremely easy to set up my library. Every song I wanted was instantly available."
"47679","Spotify",2015-01-08,4,"I love it I love the app, but there is only one thing I find faulty with it.

Which is a terrible idea, come on Spotify."

"47774","Spotify",2014-12-21,4,"Good way to enjoy music. Great way to listen to listen to music without having to pay any thing. I wish it had a sleep timer like Pandora. If I was not already paying for Pandora, I would probably pay for this and get it commercial free. But the commercials are not long or frequent. And paying gives you the option to listen offline."
"47779","Spotify",2014-11-01,5,"Wonderful! The only thing that is not the best is 30 second ads but things like Pandora do that.Other than that it is great you can make playlists and share them to everyone and follow your favorite artists and listen to their songs. I totally recommend getting it over so many other things. Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!"
"47783","Spotify",2017-01-02,4,"I love the music but one thing I was not happy ... I love the music but one thing I was not happy with is that you must have a premium account in order for Spotify to work through Alexa."

Which is helpful to keep my reputation in school!!!! 😄😄 haha ew jk. If u do not have this app, tap that download button right now!!!!!"
"47795","Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"Lots of music available for your listening pleasure This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay dollar 10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to shop and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone."

"47808","Spotify",2015-02-28,4,"What a Way To Improve on a Music Apps A bit redundant at first, then it picks up and appears to provide more variety than its competitor Pand. It also provides more opportunities at ad-free listening than P. I have yet to upgrade to their premium service but I think it is a definite improvement over my previous go-to music app."

"47838","Spotify",2014-08-26,5,"Great App I think Spotify Music is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their own custom playlist but does not want to pay for the music.

"47969","Spotify",2016-02-02,5,"really really good. The only thing I can say is that sometimes the app freezes but it is rare. And all you have to do is download. I have had it for several months and have had to do it twice. it is super worth it though."
"47971","Spotify",2014-10-20,4,"Better Than Pandora! Love it less commercial ads! You get to listen to a lot of music before and ad comes on. The app also let us you try your music without commercials and offline for a free trial. I am not sure if you have to pay for that feature after the trial period. Still trying to find that out. Otherwise a fantastic app."

It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there is nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy. it is free what more do you want?"

They can listen there on Playlist offline and I save money."
"48019","Spotify",2015-10-09,2,"Update ruined it!!! This app started out great. I used it all the time but ever since I updated it they require you to upgrade to premium just so you can turn off shuffle mode and I think that is absolutely ridicules. Do not download this app."

"48077","Spotify",2015-06-18,5,"Awesome for Music Spotify is great for music- it is like a mix of Pandora and Soundcloud. You can both listen to individual songs and even put them in playlists but also listen to specific stations for songs, like on Pandora. Overall, freakin awesome."
"48080","Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"The only reason for four stars The only reason I did not give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song."

"48103","Spotify",2015-10-26,2,"Something to Fix? Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to."

"48158","Spotify",2014-11-19,5,"my favorite app I have no idea what I did before Spotify. There are very few songs or artists that I haven't found. Making playlists is a breeze and taking music wherever I go is so awesome. I tell everybody to get this app. And the premium version really does pay for itself. Definitely a 5 star rating!"
"48162","Spotify",2017-01-05,5,"Spotify Premium Get premium, it is well worth the cost and isyour own personal juke box,and more, if you know what a juke box is."

"48166","Spotify",2015-07-22,2,"Was a Great App Spotify was a great app and worked seemlesly on my BlackBerry Z30, until the new update. Music used to play steady even after I went under the tunnel on the subway. Now the music breaks down at times like a scratched CD and cuts off."
"48168","Spotify",2015-08-18,3,"Its okay... Its great but, I can not play it offline... I can not figure out how to get it to work offline..."
"48172","Spotify",2016-12-25,3,"Okay, getting better. I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order and retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it is better now than when I first bought it.And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists."
"48199","Spotify",2017-09-29,4,"Pretty good I like how accessible it makes music and how you can make your own library of songs and playists"
"48201","Spotify",2015-02-23,5,"Love me some Spotify. This is by far my most important app. I BlueTooth it at work off the company's WiFi. I use it at home off of my WiFi. I just bought a new car and it has BlueTooth. I put all my songs on 'available offline' and now the car rocks with Spotify. Essential app I tell ya!"
"48202","Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"love the free version I have never paid for spotify so my one and only gripe is that it sucks the life out of my data plan... I am not sure if paying for it would solve that issue but if dollar 10/month would do it, I would start tomorrow! As long as you expect ads, this is the best free music server out there."
"48203","Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"Great app Easily giving Spotify 5 stars because I have it on all my devices and it has never disappointed me👌👌👍👍👏👏"
"48208","Spotify",2016-02-15,5,"Great Resource. I love the variety of music available here. I can find almost anything here, whether current or recorded in 1920. This is byFar the most comprehensive source of recorded music."

"48220","Spotify",2015-10-03,4,"AWESOME The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 is because you can not listen to the music offline unless you pay like dollar 10 a month....Other than that, I think Spotify Is one of the best music apps ever!!!😆😆😆"
"48224","Spotify",2017-04-28,5,"amazing my favorite music app of all time. waaaayyyyyy better than pandora"
"48226","Spotify",2015-04-16,4,"GREAT but... I LOVE this app to pieces but there is one problem. there is no premium on the app store like it said I even checked goggle play store!

"48285","Spotify",2015-09-27,5,"best app ever I think this is the best app ever because you gear to play songs any time you want. The only kick is you either need to have WiFi or get premium. When you are not allowed to play songs, just delete and download."

Also new music comes in frequently. Its something you truely have to get to understand and apperciate how awesome it is. Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that.

"48598","Spotify",2017-04-20,4,"Great but... This app offers you a huge selection of music for all tastes, but if you do not have the premium account you have ads. Whenever the ads come on they either get stuck and I have to press pause which means I have to get up or out of the shower and take care of it. Or the ad video gets stuck and the time keeps going and once the time runs out everything stops and the only way I have figured out to fix it is by deleting the app, downloading it again, and logging back in. This may not seem like a big deal but it frequently is happening now which is making it a huge inconvenience for me."

The free version is okay but being a student getting the premium for dollar 5 a month is totally worth it. Gives you the power to control music across devices that are on the same account via cellular connection or wifi. Downloading tracks are worth it for road trips or when you are out of the city! Lastly the music library in which you can pull from is always growing and is very solid! Oh and by the way it also syncs with your itunes library as well as shazam! So you get the best of all worlds!"

"52365","Spotify",2015-09-09,3,"MUST READ IF ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD! If you want to get this app, there are a few important things to know:1.The last I checked, they do not have Taylor Swift songs, so I am really sorry for all those Taylor Swift fans out there! I was also disappointed with that.2. You can not play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can not just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET!3. They do not have all songs, but they do have most.4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY!5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like thatTHANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I am sorry Taylor Swift fans, I do not think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it is a money /business issue. -thank you-"

"52387","Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"EPIC!!! I discovered Spotify while searching for a music app besides Pandora. I found it and fell on love with Spotify! I love how they have almost every song and artist you can think of! I personally do not have premium, but I still use my Spotify at least and hour a day. You can get everything from the original, to remixes, to the live versions of a ton of songs. I have everything from 1D to for King and Country! I love Spotify and think it is epic! Once I got my Spotify, I quit Pandora and eventually deleted the app. Spotify is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting it!!!"

"52400","Spotify",2015-11-03,5,"Spotify Rocks, and Classicals, and everything in between. Spotify has changed my life! As a dancer and dj, I have over 100,000 titles on my hard drive, but almost all of them can be found on Spotify as well, and streamed in high definition. They can also be played offline on my laptop so I can take my playlist to any location, whether it has wifi or not. I can share the playlists publicly to my dancers and fellow dj's. I can add to my Local Files the albums it does not have, as long as I have them in my collection on the given computer or network, or purchase them elsewhere. It is user friendly and cost efficient. The artists get paid by the use of their music, per play, which seems fair-ish, at 7/10 of a cent per play: great if you are a superstar, not so great if you are a budding artist, but, hey, I can FIND budding artists on Spotify that I never would never know about if it were not for their similar artist and radio functions, so all is fair and ethical, as far as I can see. Those artists that stand the test of time get paid ultimately more than those that are a flash in the pan. Hat's off to Spotify!"

"53005","Spotify",2015-12-06,4,"Great. Ehh. Resentment.... I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I would be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user I ran into the same skip limit as if I did not shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I would start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day I Guess This Is What We Call Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's and 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. that is what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that is how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There were not enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that is just based off the experiences I have read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let us say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would have gotten a bigger Kindle external memory wise. What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. coughs Pandora coughs. In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can not really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it is only dollar 12.99/month. what is that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I will pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it is features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can not go wrong."

That you can have playlists and saved songs and follow artists. do not even mind the million of ads or that unless you buy premium you can only skip 5 or 6 songs per half hour or whatever.it is awesome they have new albums the day they come out.What annoys the crap outta me is if I am listening to my playlist, the constant interruption of 'suggested' songs.I am listening to a playlist I created because I specifically want to hear those exact songs NOT random songs.But other than that I love the app."

"56310","Spotify",2014-08-27,4,"good app This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I do not pay for it there is ads but when I am listening to death metal and deathcore, I do not want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that is better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there "

"56512","Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People do not understand this amazing app. This app is simply amazing. it is musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a station or mix and that feature is decent. The algorithms are not great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that do not want to pay for premium service, you do not have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I am aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you do not need to pay dollar 9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they do not email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I have had my account for 5 months and I do not think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. happy"

"56840","Spotify",2015-05-30,3,"it is all about the Ads You can get pretty much any type of music and make a great playlist, but I can not seem to get away from commercials! Maybe there is something I am doing wrong, but if I play my downloaded songs, even they have commercials every 3 songs. I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I would lose the ads, but I am not willing to do that, as I do not listen to music constantly - or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads. I would rather buy a CD if that is the case. I do not like the Playlist Radio, because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist. it is irritating. The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like, but I have zero Abba songs and nothing like that on my playlists, but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba, of course. I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow. Still, I do enjoy being able to play somewhat without interruption a grouping of songs I have chosen."

"57428","Spotify",2015-10-10,2,"I Thought I could trust You I have been using spotify for a couple years, for free. Basically as soon as it was out I was using it. Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to I do not listen to music often only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says and number 34;only with spotify premium can you do this and number 34;..... I have never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I am really upset sad I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I am not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. sad"

"57553","Spotify",2015-10-09,3,"Okay The app is a great app, my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music. It has not been like this, and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating changes. I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to, I hate this shuffle play because it will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album, and it gets on my nerves. When I want to listen to and number 34;Freak and number 34; or and number 34;Honeymoon and number 34; by Lana Del Rey, I have to hear other songs of her with remixes that ruin her beautiful songs. It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade, it does not me me. Soo, Spotify does not want me to be happy. Most of the Music apps are on Kit Kat 4.1 Android and iOS 7-9 Apple and I have a Kindle."
"57554","Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"great app I love Spotify. I feel like I have got back in touch with music. I have found artists that I do not think I would have ever discovered because of Spotify. I will you could filter the explicit songs out though."

"57627","Spotify",2014-08-13,3,"3 stars So I made a spotify account and it was really great for a few minutes then I accidentally pressed the prime button and now I have a bill I can not pay for . I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and do not put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes"

"57644","Spotify",2015-01-22,5,"live. love. spotify. Favorite music app by far."
"57645","Spotify",2015-09-18,5,"spotify is the best With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover or rediscover all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can not really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it is not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

You can even follow artists that you like and get info on them, plus find out when they release more songs!

"58537","Spotify",2014-10-19,5,"AMAZING...but Okay, I love this app. With all of my heart and soul, but there is some things that could be different. For example, when I am trying to add a mass amount of songs to a playlist, it is very time consuming. Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once, and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add, is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together, and not just in the playlistsThanks"

So when I want to remove a song from a playlist, the app thinks I am trying to scroll to a different place in the list. Please fix this Spotify!!!Other than that the app is ok. I do strongly recommend that there should always be clean versions of all content instead of just some. on iTunes, the user can pick to see Clean or Explicit versions of songs. They should have this on Spotify too. Or maybe they could just have a clean versions alongside the explicit version.Also there should be an alarm clock feature. If there already us it should be easier to find. If there is not, please add it!Thanks Spotify!"

"58761","Spotify",2015-11-28,5,"Best music app! I personally am not able to buy many songs, and when I do I get bored of them within a week. This app completely revolutionized listening to music for me. I can follow playlists of certain music groups to expand my library, save songs that I love, and follow artists to get notifications about new releases. One of the newer features, looking for upcoming concerts, is one of my favorites. I used to be so out of touch with who is coming where, and now I have easy access! Definitely recommend this app."
"58763","Spotify",2014-06-24,5,"Great I love Spotify! The premium is so much better but a bit expensive. I highly recommend this as a music source for PC, Tablet and phone."
"58769","Spotify",2015-12-20,5,"AMAZING,TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!! This app is amazing. I mean u can get free music, make a playlist, and search for ANY song! Btw... if and when u do get the app, it might ask if u want to start a free 7 day trial to listen to songs anywhere, anytime... this trial is truly free and does goes through all 7 days. U DO need Wi-Fi for the app to work.. but when u are connected it works perfectly. I would give this app 100 or more if possible anyways...all in all.... this app is amazing for anything. that is why I give this 5 stars."

"58774","Spotify",2015-09-02,4,"Although I enjoy both music sources I had an unlimited selection change ... Did take me a little time to figure out product. Smooth transition from Pandora. Although I enjoy both music sources I had an unlimited selection change / skip that Pandora Limits. Enjoyed the ability to select Singles from albums. Worth the Membership. Keep your Pandora for hands free listening, Try Spotify to share Music files, or creating Videos."
"58778","Spotify",2017-08-12,2,"Internal error The app would not work on my Samsung S6 edge .It loaded with no problem but when I tried to start it it gave me an internal error and would not run. I would like to use it but can not."
"58780","Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"AMAZING but..... Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it is either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I am worried it will use up my data too. Besides that, it is pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist for free with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!"
"58787","Spotify",2015-09-14,3,"Decent, but not perfect. I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
"58788","Spotify",2016-08-05,5,"Perfect song app You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it is all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it is more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
"58791","Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"Best Music Streaming Service! Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to! from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you are able to listen to your music - commercial free."
"58798","Spotify",2016-05-21,5,"No Better Music App!!! I have been looking for a updated music app which wan't glitchy or not official. So far there is no better application to listen to music on. I highly recommend Spotify. It is MUCH better than other musical apps because it has all the music you could ever want. Including letting you make endless amounts of playlists which I personally LOVE. If you are looking for a good app to play music on, then download this application."
"58799","Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Stream vs Storage. I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they did not have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to dollar 1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I do not need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I could not find something on Spotify. I would not be surprised if you could not find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it is made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
"58803","Spotify",2016-03-07,5,"Let There Be Rock! Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse and worse until the point of being unbearable when it would not even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement and came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues and they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
"58804","Spotify",2016-02-17,5,"Get it. Srsly Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you are wanting to just have it on while you are working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."
"58807","Spotify",2015-12-05,2,"Sticking With Pandora My 7-day free trial ended. Once your trial ends, Spotify stinks. When you go to your playlists or radio stations they start playing random stuff! For example: I was on Ariana Grande radio and they started playing Timbaland and Nelly Furtado! You should stick with Pandora."
"58809","Spotify",2016-08-16,3,"It would have been wayyyyy better Ugh there ok, I got premium for free for three months, but after a couple off weeks I would play about three songs in a row, and the song stops playing and I would constantly have to press play. I asked a friend of mine if he had experienced that problem and he had too. I know it is not my connection because of other music apps I play. Get that fixed and then I will think about purchasing Premium."
"58815","Spotify",2016-08-13,2,"Some things make no sense to me, no sense to me, nonsense to me It was wonderful then a billing error and I can not access my music, playlists, recommendations, my availability to get artist and cover art pictures. Seriously my card was stolen and I do not know the last 4 numbers of the card because I do not know which one was stolen. How do I do that if all my cards were stolen? Does this make sense to you? It does not make any sense to me? Explain sensai"
"58816","Spotify",2016-11-26,5,"aetao25's review It is perfect to sit down, relax, and listen to your favorite songs! You can find your friends profile or albums and follow them! You can even follow your favorite artists and their albums of to listen to!"
"58817","Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!! This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
"58824","Spotify",2016-12-02,5,"is the best option. Finally Having spent hours utilizing all the streaming music apps, websites, share site...ect - Spotify, is the best option. Finally, someone has it right. Premium option opens doors for work, play, gym and a plethora of other options. Especially, when you can download your playlists and use it offline in those dungeonesqe areas of concrete and steel. Get it. - Cheers, B"
"58826","Spotify",2016-12-08,5,"Kristina Love it...can listen to my music anywhere and everywhere..whether its brand new or from the 90s..!!!!"
"58827","Spotify",2017-01-07,5,"You have to become a Premium Member...It worth it if you really love music. I am a premium member and love this app. I have several playlist and music is my life so I am always streaming my music and listening to it. I like a lot of Genres of music and this app is perfect for me, it fits my needs. I like that you can just listen to the artist unlike there competitor Pandora which only plays artist similar to the one you picked, Also I like the Offline mode when you are a Premium member, where you can download a song or album and listen to it at anytime even if you have no internet connection like on an airplane in airplane mode."
"58828","Spotify",2016-08-30,5,"Spot On I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections. Very easy to use. I am 63 years young and still rock in. Which we had this in my school years, beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
"58832","Spotify",2016-09-26,5,"Best music app and program ever This app is awesome! I have been looking for a app that plays songs while I play games etc. Thank you so much!"
"58834","Spotify",2015-01-09,2,"Try something else Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. 90 percent of the time, I use Spotify when I am out and can not access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. it is less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something."
"58845","Spotify",2016-05-13,4,"Love Spotify Love Spotify, I pay for the premium sub which lets you save over 3000 tracks for offline play. Commercial radio is dead - Spotify is expanding podcast support making it a great audio choice whatever your preferences."
"58846","Spotify",2015-03-04,2,"Meh.. Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it is very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can not switch payment plans to another account so it is stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."
"58847","Spotify",2017-01-30,5,"it is great Great app😍😍😍😍 love it"
"58849","Spotify",2016-01-09,5,"premium is worth the dollar We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem! However, you can not set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid dollar 5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
"58850","Spotify",2015-03-03,3,"Spotify App has Limitations I love Spotify. I will say that right now. I have it on my iMac, my iPad, and on my kindle, and I do not even pay for premium. I am, however, very disappointed with the kindle spotify app. I can still make playlists and listen to radio, but I have a limited number of skips and it never plays the song I want it to. It shuffles and suggests songs constantly and also plays songs over again. What I do not understand it why I have these limitations on my kindle but not on my iPad or iMac. Is Apple so superior that I can not have the same update on my kindle??"
"58851","Spotify",2015-01-20,2,"Worked great, Now almost unusable At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can not get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It does not seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps I.e. Pandora seem to be working just fine. I am about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"
"58855","Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I do not mind but they pause and can not play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen . . . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park in the end , numb,and no more sorrow you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
"58856","Spotify",2017-04-08,5,"Get it if you are picky about songs. I love this app it is the best apps ever it is 1 out of the 7 apps I downloaded on my Tablet but if you are not patient then sorry , every 30 minutes they give you like 2 or 3 adds no biggie. I am even listening to Paris on Spotify right now !!!😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😁😁😁"
"58857","Spotify",2014-06-24,4,"Super Love it!!! Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it. Have suggested it to a couple friends that did not know about it."
"58858","Spotify",2017-04-28,5,"Great music app I love this app and it is premium. All in all its easy to use and has most songs! 😃😃"
"58859","Spotify",2017-01-18,5,"I love it! I love streaming music. Every album I have wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I will have more time for music and cancel it easily when I do not. I try all kinds of music because there is no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.there is no need to store things. it is great for people who do not have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. it is not just for millennials."
"58861","Spotify",2014-06-23,4,"Eh... but good Unless you have premium, it kinda sucks because you can not listen to songs on demand; only shuffle. But rather than that, it is a great app! Easy setup,"
"58863","Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Spotify is cool Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I have experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."
"58865","Spotify",2017-06-30,5,"💘 it! Spotify is amazing and a fantastic app. I love how it is integrated with other devices and I can control em all at the same time."
"58877","Spotify",2017-02-21,5,"Crazy Song app Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that."
"58878","Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"I always use this app! I was looking for good music apps and I do not really like pandora...it does not have enough skips and u do not know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this 10 stars if I could!"
"58881","Spotify",2016-05-03,5,"If I Could Give It a Perfect 10 I Would I was reluctant to try this ironically enough because it is free and I figured the whole you get what you pay for adage is an adage for a reason. When Beats Music got bought out I figured I would give Spotify a go before signing up with another subscription service. it is the best decision I have made in a long time."
"58882","Spotify",2016-06-22,4,"Bruh ._. Okay so I update spotify and it says I have NO internet while I am clearly connected to the internet. I also hate how 3/4 of the options are only for Premium. This makes me an unhappy customer, I am not going to waste my time buying some Premium when I could easily get my favorite songs from YouTube to mp3."
"58883","Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"assuming you are not into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they do not have it is Spotify....nothing to complain about, assuming you are not into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they do not have.No tricksy hobbitses to be found here, you just drop a dollar 10 every month and you get unlimited access to basically every song out there to download and play whenever. Shuffle is pretty meh it definitely does not cycle through your whole list like it should but I really can not complain about the 600 songs I have gotten for pocket change."

"58894","Spotify",2015-10-02,2,"meh Can only play shuffled. can not just listen to an album from beginning to end. Ads are way too loud. Much louder than the music. I find myself ripping out my ear phones when an ad starts even though the music itself was not very loud."
"58897","Spotify",2015-11-22,3,"Ughh This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It does not continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it will play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it is the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it is a necessary evil."

Not only is the premium service only worth the money if I am using it on mobile but the free version is so irritating it basically forces you to upgrade. While it is perfectly reasonable for ads to play when using a free service I noted two things recently after years of using it: 1 an average of three adds ran in between each song - a rate that even Pandora never uses and 2 ads ran when I played my own local files."
"58921","Spotify",2017-02-07,5,"Best app ever! This app is like a best friend that is always there for you. The music encourages me, comforts me, opens my eyes, cheers me up, makes me happy and more! I just love the music so much! There is ALWAYS more to listen to. And you get to listen to what you like and want when you want to! It is amazing and totally FREE if you do not get premium. Which you already have the full package without premium!"
"58924","Spotify",2014-06-19,5,"Spotify is Spot On! Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better! The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch.

"58972","Spotify",2015-09-23,1,"worst update Ever since the new update it has disabled you to turn off shuffle. It it gives you ads that are more consistent than before. The app restricts your ability of listening to your music when you want and what you want to play. Overall it has given more ads limited the amounts of skips and only allows you to shuffle play which may play songs that do not fit your mood."
"58976","Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect Way better than Pandora or any other music app I have tried, its also way cheaper than using iTunes since you do not have to pay for the songs you add.

"58996","Spotify",2014-09-16,5,"Ich finde dies 'hella danmn gut! ya?!? I likes this one real good. It is better than the YouTube for straight music listening. One does not need to sift through 'covers' or sound quality and the tracks are delineated with shuffling, queuing, communities, following and such.

They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I do not use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist online or off has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, and always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit Home before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it and selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you are also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"

"59242","Spotify",2016-08-04,5,"Super Good! Very similar to the desktop app. Only occasional crashes. Easy to use.Spotify service is fantastic! Try it free! I was using the p service and it was ok. But with Spotify I can make my own lists, as well as listen to radio. Then I got premium! Love this! No going back! I can find 90 to 95 percent of what I want. And with the Discover Weekly playlist I get 30 recommendations a week for my highly eclectic tastes. Loving it!This was not a paid review!"

"59263","Spotify",2015-05-30,1,"Love / Hate Relationship I liked how it started out, and was leaning towards it becoming my favorite.

"59266","Spotify",2014-09-20,1,"Not working, suddenly. I love spotify, but this app just stopped working for no apparent reason. I merely get a blank screen when the app is opened. If you can fix this, I will give it five stars."

"59278","Spotify",2016-05-16,5,"it is Strength Is Its Library of Music I am two weeks into the free test drive of the premium website. The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's was not available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify. Of course, for what amounts to dollar 120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that is not available on Prime. Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like. From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."
"59279","Spotify",2014-09-28,1,"Dumb app This app is a RADIO app you do not get to choose the music you want to listen too it is hard to use and hard to understand plus the music buffers and it will not load right."

"59407","Spotify",2016-04-03,5,"Spotify is just what I needed to help with my music obsession I listen to music for hours 10 every day from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night. I have a rather large and unwieldy music collection ranging from hundreds of vinyl albums to cassette mix tapes remember those? to CDs to untold mp3s. SPOTIFY is a place I can almost always count on to have all my music collection queued and ready to play anywhere I am online. Then, there is all the music I have yet to discover, old and new. Even listening all the time is not enough to even scratch the surface on new releases. I am frugal, but 9.99 a month is well worth it to me. I love Spotify."

I have since then stopped using it and returned to youtube because I want to hear my own music. The ads never bothered me, I would deal with them if I could relax to the music I felt like playing at the time. It used to be so simple to use and now it is not.

Every time I hit play it starts playing the recommended song which is nothing close to the song I chose. To top it off I get at least one email a day attempting to sell me a premium membership. I understand how spotty is supposed to work but my patients attempting to play my selection has worn thin and I will not continue with spotty. Prime music, songza, and my own library will be just fine."

I can not sign up through Facebook because my email is already being used or they are experiencing technical issues, I can not login through email because I have to go through Facebook, I can not contact Spotify because I can not login. I would love to find out why this app has 4.5 stars but I can not even get past the login screen."
"59770","Spotify",2015-11-26,1,"Horrible This app is falling down the drain. The app once allowed kindle fire users to pick any song on command but now they have took away our ability to do so. We only are capable as working like a mobile device having to click shuffle play in order to play music, even from our play lists. This act they have done is not fair and I vehemently believe we shall be able to freely pick a song on kindle fire tablets."
"59774","Spotify",2017-04-29,4,"Lies I hate how I am just trying to listen to my Twenty One Pilots but when I played it, it said: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music. So I am like OK. So, one three-and-a-half song later, it says: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music and three more ads after that. But it is still a good app because I can make playlists of my favorite songs."
"59779","Spotify",2015-08-02,1,"unreliable on kindle fire everytime i open the app it says and number 34;No internet connection available and number 34; and that is not true because 2 seconds later i open netflix and messenger and they work fine. i open spotify expecting it to not work, that is how unreliable it is for me. it rarely does work, and when it does, the ads glitch and spotify stops working because of the ads"

"59832","Spotify",2015-04-06,5,"Rockin wit the Spotify! Spotify app is on the money!!! I use the free version and I love it. I have found artist and songs that I haven't heard in years. Spotify is unique in that when you search for an artist you get that artist music only. If you want similar artist their name and music is to the right side of the page. No mixing if you do not want to mix.I love being able to listen to a specific entire albums of an artist and that is something you can not do on Pandora... And do not get me wrong, I love Pandora."

Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past. I see more and more Car stereo decks hitting the scene without CD players but set up for USB, auxiliary input, SD card and Bluetooth. Spotify is THE S number !T !!!!!!!!"

"59912","Spotify",2015-07-17,4,"I love this app! But... Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime as long as I have a WiFi connection and I am glad the music continues to play when the screen is off I use the app on a FireHDI do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time it is most likely to happen while I am on the web the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. Which, btw, counts as a and number 34;skip and number 34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"

"59919","Spotify",2015-10-28,1,"randomly alters what you can do with it I used to love the free version of spotify, until it randomly stopped letting me listen to music unless I added it to a playlist. Instead of playing in any chronological order, I have to shuffle my music, so it is bassicaly the same as any other bad music app that ive tried. In order to regain the abillity to listen to songs by clicking on them, I would have to pay for a premium subscription. Just another scam to get people to buy something."

But now, since the new update does not allow you to pick your own songs, I can not listen to it anymore. I have tried using it, but it is frustrating trying to find a specific Misfits song or something, then suddenly, I get stuck on a band I did not even want to listen to. Until Spotify let us me pick my own stuff again, I am deleting it"

Missing albums for many of the artists that they do have for many of the ones I follow and have in my playlists. The ads for their own company will blow out your eardrums. do not know why they have to have them be so loud. It does not really change when you lower the volume on the device you have.The app cuts out shortly after I enter my browser or go to text. It forces me to remain on the app at all times. can not even browse Facebook.Yeah, you should get it but be prepared for manual updates and a long list of problems."

Or even playing it on my ps4 through my T.V. while playing a game or just listening to it in the background. Offline playlist are nice for not eating up data with no wifi. Great Music App, its worth full membership for anyone who listens to music all the time in my opinion."

"60014","Spotify",2017-03-17,4,"Best Music App on Appstore, with One Minor Problem... This is by far the best app for listening to music. You can listen to anybody, anywhere, any time. it is incredible. One problem I have with the most recent update, however, is that I can not seem to be able to add anything to any of my playlists. I tap the add to playlist button and nothing happens. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"60016","Spotify",2016-04-05,5,"amazing This music app is probably the best music app out there I lidsten to music 24/7 and this one actually stays on the person, band, or whatever instead of going to other things lile Pandora does"
"60017","Spotify",2016-04-19,1,"Stops playing real often and hard to restart Stops playing and will not restart without turning off and usually have to wait several minutes before it will start again. Also will not play entire playlist - stops after each album and can not get it to continue same playlist. I always have to go to another playlist. I am very disappointed in Spotify after reading the good reviews on the app. When I went to the help.section , I saw many others who were having the same problems I have with the player stopping so often and the responses from the help center indicate they have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it. If the problem is not corrected soon I will look for another music, etc app. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"

"60034","Spotify",2015-11-24,5,"Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands and even some of them are here, Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love. It has way more than other subscription services I have tried. The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another. I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I am listening to to a playlist, I will not find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device. I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who do not mind commercials Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it is just more convenient. I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly works for major commercial artists, but that is not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs? When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

"60060","Spotify",2016-07-10,5,"Highly Recommend It I love spotify. It lets you enjoy music while doing other things and when you go on YouTube/internet or games it will automatically pause. You can pick your own songs by searching them and adding them to playlists and you can listen to other peoples playlists by looking them up. You should definitely check it out."
"60063","Spotify",2016-06-08,4,"A Great Music App. I just recently discovered this app. It is great! You can choose any genre that you feel like listening to. You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you will start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time. There is every kind of music you can think of ."
"60067","Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect gift for my grandson! He seemed disappointed at first, only downloading the app on his cellular phone, but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots, and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots, as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."
"60075","Spotify",2015-11-05,4,"Eureka! Where have you been all my life? I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the Discover function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past and my past is pretty extensive. Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again and they are repetitious, but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"
"60080","Spotify",2014-06-22,5,"Nice Service I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself. I notice the app plays short ads, where for some reason I do not if I use the web page on my PC, maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads."

"60088","Spotify",2015-11-22,1,"was awesome... It was a good music service until they made it like mobile where you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want.

"60089","Spotify",2016-03-27,4,"Listen to the whole album! This is a great music app! I love how you can listen to any song on an album and download songs premium to listen to without using data! Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button is not hit and it will not resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc"
"60101","Spotify",2016-06-13,3,"Was awesome This app sucks. When I installed it the app would not respond. It was maybe the lack of internet in my house but the app is awful."
"60105","Spotify",2016-06-21,5,"Cannot Live Without This! There is nothing I can say about Spotify that has not been said a million times before. This program is simply amazing. For just over dollar 10.00 a month I can listen to any song pretty much ever created. I get the new radio singles, new albums, singles from weird indie bands I have never heard of, customized playlists, Sunday playlists for when I want to chill, the ability to search by song, artist, or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to every day, constantly, non-stop, I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you do not have a membership, get one ASAP. This is how music playing should be! I have it installed on my computer, cellphone, and Kindle so I have access to it from literally anywhere. Please and thank you!"

"60114","Spotify",2016-11-18,4,"I like Spotify a lot... Spotify became my GO TO app for streaming music. I like the variety and flexibility. I like Spotify best when it works with my devices. It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire. I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues. They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope. The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."
"60118","Spotify",2015-03-30,5,"Spotify Premium makes this the best source for music I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. you are the best. Keep up the good work!Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it is only dollar 5 a month, and that is a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. it is just great."
"60119","Spotify",2016-07-26,4,"Great but I am giving it four stars.... Spotify is great! It is almost like Pandora only you can search and pick individual songs and make your own playlists. They do not have everything but they do have a lot. Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording but I do not know if Spotify controls that or not."

What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear! Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I do not want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future.

"60150","Spotify",2016-05-23,4,"A great way to find new and old music and add to my library I finally got this app to work on my new phone!! Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone. I have been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can not immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it. So a lot of deleting is going on. I am also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I am looking for. Very inconsistent. But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it is a great way to find new and old music and add to my library."
"60152","Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"I like it. it is a pretty good app. The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed. It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps, and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again. But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists , but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites, I could not find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like Lady of Shallot , which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."
"60154","Spotify",2017-01-18,5,"Helped me find new amazing music Spotify is an amazing app if you are wanting to listen to music. You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! there is a tiny but. haha On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you do not know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it is not when there is one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it is helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite 😊"
"60163","Spotify",2015-12-25,5,"Spotify is the music app you NEED to have! Spotify is the music app you NEED to have! Whether you use the free version or purchase Spotify premium, you will find hours upon hours of enjoyment with this app. You use Facebook to create an account, after which you can share your favorite tracks and playlists with friends. You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists. I will encounter ads every 30 minutes, after which I will have 30 minutes of ad-free music. By purchasing Spotify premium, you can save your playlists offline with no ads, higher quality music, and not having to listen on shuffle mode."

Its partly a socail media so you can get followers and stuff based on how much other people like your playlists and songs 4.You can even listen to your playlist and songs offline!!! 5. Also there is remixs,explicit versions, clean versions, and all of that too! So if you still do not believe me try it for you self for FRRREEEEEE!!!!!!!"

"60173","Spotify",2014-10-14,4,"ROCK O bye SPOTIFY!!! Been using SPOTIFY for about 2 1/2 years and has always been able to satisfy the only reason I could not give 5 stars is that it seems to lack one thing that a number of other streams provide and that is a sleep timer and/or alarm clock feature ...other than that it is really good at laying out the new releases discovery tracks, mood plays, had used a competitor for a bit of time and was happy with there genre/ subgenre UI layout but after some research on SPOTIFY found that it has its own app that does lay out those choices. So yeah may not give a wake up call or drift me off into a good slumber but would not choose it over any other....."
"60180","Spotify",2014-12-28,5,"spotify new user Well for the longest I would use this app in the free version. On PC its the best program for me even in free version because you create unlimited playlists and skip as many times as you want only there was commercials. I recently upgraded to premium and it is 100x better. No more commercials and some features I do not use. I forgot to mention spotify on mobile only allows several skips a day. With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose. I personally liked the free version over Pandora for the simple fact that I could make a playlist on Spotify and play it on my phone but would be on random or and number 34;shuffle and number 34;. And now I just like the fact that I can now fully listen to my music and not be annoyed with commercials or no more skips allowed."

"60197","Spotify",2016-11-09,5,"The best choice for music streaming There are many apps that allow users “free” access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities. The Spotify app combines inexpensive buy-in with user-friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app.In terms of a free app, the Spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without Wi-Fi. Once the user decides to pay for the Premium version of the application, these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating. For this review, I will be assessing Premium Spotify and not the free version of the app.The cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of dollar 9.99 down to dollar 5.99. Although for some this may seem pricey, access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the iTunes store which charges dollar 1.29 per song. Many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without Wi-Fi and without using one’s data plan if saved to a specific playlist.This is more efficient, affordable, and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past. Free applications such as Limewire or its predecessor Frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto one’s computer. Many of the songs were incompatible file types for iTunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players. Spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with iTunes libraries and having cross-platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices.Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20,000 songs each day. One still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like Soundcloud. In comparison to apps like Pandora Spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist, or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety. Looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own.All in all, Spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog. Supplementing Spotify with free apps like Soundcloud and Pandora work well to complement Spotify in the areas where it falls a little short. Even with its shortcomings, the price, music catalog, user friendly layout, and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming."

I haven't tried the premium, yet. Only because I really like the music ads. I have been introduced to a number of good artists from the ads. Besides, the ads are not that frequent and only 30 seconds long. Once over, you back listening to your music. I really can not say e enough good things about SPOTIFY. I have been recommending it to my friends on Facebook."

I love searching for the perfect song, or that album I haven't heard since I was a teenager. Then there are the times I just select one of countless compilations/artist/playlist and enjoy. The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"

I have virtually unlimited access to the music of this world here, can make my own mixes and listen to it on ALL my devices. Perhaps my favorite feature is the recommendations based on what I typically listen to. I have found several artists that I adore and probably would have never known about had not it been for Spotify. Thank you thank you thank you!"
"60252","Spotify",2015-06-29,3,"ALMOST perfect, BUT! Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the dollar 9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you do not want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
"60253","Spotify",2016-01-08,5,"Superior app This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."
"60255","Spotify",2016-04-20,5,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon ... I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The loudness is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."
"60257","Spotify",2014-11-30,4,"Great for Music Lovers Better For Those Subscribed to Spotify Premium! Alongside with the Spotify Premium service dollar 10/mo., this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I am out there.Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"
"60260","Spotify",2017-05-15,5,"Spotlfy Is Spot On! I was using Pandora but for some reason started having problems accessing it so I decided to try Spotify. I am really pleased with how many more songs there are with each artist, I prefer this to Pandora."
"60262","Spotify",2017-08-29,2,"Spotify is spotty. The app froze on a Geico commercial so I deleted it from my device. A Geico insurance commercial...so random. It had been working wonderfully up until then. Oh well, good thing it is free...nothing lost."
"60271","Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"pc app I dont like the Kindle Fire app, because the only thing i can do is listen to music in shuffle. So i tried pc version and it is absolutely baller good, you can listen to music every way you want and when you want. Shuffle, repeat or normally. I recommend this for PC using Windows 7 dont know how world for Mac users"
"60272","Spotify",2017-11-07,5,"Spotify is my jam!!! This is currently my favorite app in existence. Worth the monthly fee for all the music. Instead of buying a CD per month, I get access to 30 million songs. Win!"
"60280","Spotify",2017-03-23,1,"would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour A few months ago, I subscribed my daughter to Spotify Premium, taking advantage of a dollar 0.99-for-3-month deal. Everthing went through on the website. Spotify then decided that my daughter was not eligible for the deal just because I paid with the same credit card as my own Spotify Premium account. And without telling me, Spotify charges my daughter the full price of AUD11.99 per month for 3 months. I contacted Spotify and they will only offer one month's refund as a one-off courtesy . So, Spotify charged me without my authorisation; would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour. So, I told Spotify: give me full refund or else do not bother!Be very careful of these Spotify deals - they are unscrupulous."
"60283","Spotify",2017-07-09,5,"I love it I love it so much but do not get pinterest my mom accidentally logged me out one day we tried to find the password but we could not because all you can see is little dots so we had to recreate my board full of about 2 million pins I had had that board since the first grade and now I am in fifth grade. Pinterest does not give you a password at all."

"60287","Spotify",2015-09-11,5,"My Dreams Came True It does not get any better then Spotify, Fact. It has every single song or artist I have ever searched for, unlimited listening and what seems like a never ending artist list, No glitches, easy and fun believe it or not to navigate and I enjoy their ever-growing Playlist much more then I would have thought and there is a-figgin'-lot. In fact it is almost too much at times because I find myself searching things more then listening😂 but I am not complaining because I have discovered so many artist I probably would have never stumbled across without. I have spent more hours on this app then any other. Thank you Spotify, your app bettered my life👏💗🎶💋"
"60291","Spotify",2016-05-06,5,"Great app Great! Easy to use, does all that it claims. There are some glitches in some tracks that I have downloaded, not so sure if that is DRM...not sure that it is worth the Premium if all downloads are glitchy. But streaming in my studio is wonderful."

"60305","Spotify",2015-08-02,5,"Great app, questionable ads Spotify is wonderful, what would I do without it? I use it in my art classroom while students work, and I listen to it while I work in my studio. My only complaint is ads, I just wish they were a bit more edited for content as people of all ages listen to Spotify. I had to stop using it for a while in class because there were Trojan ads on every hour, I really did not want parent complaints."
"60307","Spotify",2017-11-09,3,"more like 2. 5 It does not deserve 3 stars, more like 2.5. Spotify is great for free. You get what you pay for. There is an advertisement before the play list is executed and after the second song. I have several playlists created but for some reason after about 4 songs Spotify inserts artists I never heard of. Looses internet connection a lot. Like I said, you get what you pay for."
"60308","Spotify",2016-03-25,5,"spotify is the best thing since sliced bread will never go back to Pandora I Have a list of 3000 songs put it on random everything from metallica to Madonna pat benitar to pato Banton have a live music list, reggae list, 80s new wave list, I even have a list of my top 50 or so songs and only allow myself that list if I am exercising,, free is great"

"60313","Spotify",2017-05-10,5,"Space run out I used to have Spotify on my tablet, however I deleted it after running out of storage space. Love the music, yet very limit choices to Asian culture lovers"

I used to have Pandora and Spotify is so much better. it is nice to be able to select a specific song to play, Pandora does not allow you that option. And so far Spotify allows me to skip as many songs as I want if I do not want to hear what they suggest. Pandora only allows you to skip so many songs at a time, then it makes you wait to skip a song after you have met your quota for songs you do not like."
"60338","Spotify",2017-08-08,5,"Spotify Spotify is a really good music app. If you get premium you can go advertisement-free. You can create your own playlists and make them public or private. You can even access other playlists created by the Spotify team or other users. The best part is that you czmanb access full music albums from your favorite artists for free. I 100 percent guarantee that this app will fulfil your needs."

However this past spring, I thought hmmmm let us check out Google Play's music app, and after 2 months returned to Spotify. Your app, and the new lay out and updated features are AWESOME! 🙋 Your team has always been helpful when I had ?'s and promptly with responses. I will continue to be a long time listener and supporter of Spotify!!! Thank you"
"60373","Spotify",2017-06-05,5,"I absolutely love this app I. Just got a kindle and the first thing I wanted to download was an app that I could playbmy music on. Spotify did just that. One thing I would change though is that there is no clean version of songs. I have a younger brother that cannot listen to my music because of some words said. Now I can inky use earbuds. Please fix this"

"60378","Spotify",2017-06-27,3,"App needs work I like Spotify, but their app needs a lot of work. The layout is nice, the ads are not that intrusive, but it is very slow to load and there are little touches that would make it more user friendly, such as placing a pause button on the lock screen of your phone."
"60379","Spotify",2017-06-26,5,"Is there a song you can not find on Spotify? Is there a song you can not find on Spotify? I am amazed at the wide variety of music on Spotify. If you love music, you need Spotify."

There are times when a song or two are not available but I am sure it has to do with licensing issues that come with artists and streaming services. Otherwise I think it is worth the dollar 10"

And if I am not mistaken you can publish your playlists, and share playlists between friends double check on that feature though. So yeah, Spotify's the bestest."
"60404","Spotify",2016-05-28,4,"Great for listening to music I love using Spotify. It has nearly all the music I want. The free version does have ads, but I do not mind them so much.

Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me and number 34;oh, I do not even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better. and number 34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application I haven't upgraded yet is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."

"60450","Spotify",2015-01-20,4,"good for a phone If you have 4g lite it would be a lot better. But if you do not you have to upgrade it but it will not let me. I would say it is good if you have Wi-Fi."
"60456","Spotify",2017-09-01,4,"Wonderful!! Spotify is a wonderful free music app that I enjoy very much. I can create my own playlists and also listen to others. Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. that is not a ridiculous asking price I am just too cheap. I thoroughly enjoy this app!"

All your favorite songs, albums, and all music that Spotify is able to get their hands on for free. FORGET paying dollar 1.99 per song. For mobile devices, as long ass you have WiFi you have Spotify without using data. And with premium you can be wiout WiFi and without the data loss. I personally that no its amazing."

I have set up several categories, one for Bozz Scaggs, one for Sam Smith, one for Steely Dan, one for individual tracks or particular albums. it is a great, carefree app. There are a few ads with the free version, but so far they do not bother me. They do have a service without ads for a monthly fee, for those who prefer it."
"60552","Spotify",2015-01-18,5,"my hit station I love spotlight very much, the innovation of having music is very attentive to the listener's choices of what type of music to enjoy, only wish that the commercial could be weakened out a little more so that the listener's can enjoy more without signing up for the premium. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get the quality of music and sound they are looking for in music"

With Spotify I can listen to all my favorite groups and/or songs. I am glad that I have come across this app. You can try it for free or if you do not like ads you can subscribe for a low price!"

"60573","Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"Great app for music. Still working great for my BlackBerry Passport. Recently updated the app and still my music companion. Just this app is a battery hog. Keep your phone on plug when using spotify."
"60577","Spotify",2017-09-14,5,"Podcasts are gr9 I can listen to that good good McElroy content those are some excellent boys and I love them and Spotify let us me hear them be stupid for free."
"60579","Spotify",2017-03-12,5,"Great choice Love spotify. Such an amazing selection of genres. We use it at church as well as in my office because of the large selection of Christian artists and instrumental easy listening. Worth the upgrade."
"60582","Spotify",2017-05-03,5,"Great Functional App I have used the Android version of Spotify for years, very pleased to find it on Amazon. And it is kept up to date with the Android app."
"60587","Spotify",2017-11-06,5,"Five Stars Very good"
"60588","Spotify",2017-01-26,5,"Love Spotify! So far, whenever a song pops into my head and I HAVE to hear it NOW, spotify has never failed to have it. I like many genres of music and it all seems to be just waiting for me to ask. What could be better?"
"60591","Spotify",2017-03-09,5,"Five Stars great place to listen to any music under the Sun Or Moon!"
"60595","Spotify",2017-01-30,5,"Music Who does not love music? I wish there were more of my favorite songs on here, but for the most part there is a rather large number of my favorite hits on this app.I love it and recommend it to others."
"60599","Spotify",2014-10-05,5,"Spotify Rocks I only listen to the free music. I do not purchase the upgrade to listen commerical free. The commercials on the free level can be annoying. Spotify works perfectly. It is easy to search for music. Users can create their own playlists. You can listen to or follow a playlist created by someone else. The variety of available music genres and artists is large enough that everyone can find something they like."
"60600","Spotify",2015-11-05,5,"Best subscription music service on the market. Best subscription service of all time. I have not liked a music service this much since the real Napster. I will say that Apple Music has several artists that spotify is missingTaylor Swift. However Apple Music does not currently work with android devices. No android is a deal breaker for me. Amazon's Prime music service is missing so many artists it is hardly worth mentioning."
"60601","Spotify",2017-04-28,5,"Stimulate Mind and Body With Spotify, I never hear the same ol' same ol'. I am hearing many songs for the first time by my favorite artist. I love giving my mind some new info in the form of music. Spotify is the best music app!! I listen as I workout and hearing all the new music makes time fly by quickly. Thanks"
"60603","Spotify",2017-07-02,5,"Easily share and discover new music The Spotify app is easy to use, even on my Fire tablet! I like the capability to share playlists, and the radio function makes it easy to discover new music."
"60609","Spotify",2017-03-01,5,"My favorite app. I can listen to this all day ... My favorite app. I can listen to this all day and night. You can listen to music with the screen off so it saves battery. I can listen to an 8 hour long playlist and turn the screen back on with battery life left to spare."
"60611","Spotify",2017-11-12,5,"Love it Great music and everything I likeYou can go out of the app"
"60616","Spotify",2015-09-18,3,"Update Spotify came out with an update that makes it to were everything is shuffle play unless you buy premium. So every time I want to listen to a song I have to hit shuffle play and hope for the best. But I found that the best way to find your song is to either make small playlists or quit the app and go back into it when it is not your song."
"60620","Spotify",2017-04-19,5,"Perfect best app i have ever gotten in my life!!!"
"60624","Spotify",2017-07-25,4,"Briliant search capability Not only does this find thes song searched for, it finds every version of it. Thats great when you have time to review each version and select it into your playlist. In a party situation its too easy to put the wrong version into the queue. This is my only criticism . Its an excellent app."
"60627","Spotify",2017-07-29,5,"Five Stars Useful app."
"60630","Spotify",2016-01-25,5,"Great music app, simple and great selection! Spotify has a great selection of music and spoken word works. it is not just an app for listening to music but also has audio books, selections to learn different languages, and stories among other stuff. There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top. When you are in another app and want to go back you have to reopen spotify to do so."
"60634","Spotify",2017-06-26,5,"Five Stars I can go straight to what ever songs, albums, artist I want without waiting."
"60639","Spotify",2016-12-22,5,"Used daily I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it is great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it is totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"
"60641","Spotify",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars Love my Spotify Music had it for over 3 years"
"60642","Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"Awesome !! I can not say enough about it. It works, has what I like and is easy to use. The commercials every 30 minutes are not a problem at all. If you listen to radio, you get commercials. If you listen on Spotify, you get to choose what songs or artists you want to hear."
"60644","Spotify",2017-08-21,5,"I love spotify, I do not mind the adds for the ... I love spotify,I do not mind the adds for the free service. I would pay for the service if they gave discounts for seniors like they do for students, they are missing I believe a large subscription base."
"60651","Spotify",2015-09-12,2,"The new update is awful!! I use to use spotify all the time! The newest update makes it non useable! they are forcing me to use shuffle play, putting on songs I have never even heard of, and taking me off of my playlist! And it keeps shoving the premium upgrade in my face! I sincerely hope that spotify will go back to the way it was."
"60659","Spotify",2016-03-22,4,"great price and service, app acts weird For the relatively small price of a basic subscription, the options of downloading REALLY great music to your phone to stream no matter where you are and unlimited skips, this service is a steal. However, the unexpected stops while streaming data free can be frustrating, though it is more likely a glitch with the app than the service itself. Apart from that, I love it!"
"60661","Spotify",2017-04-23,5,"Any song youwant Cannot spend 10 bucks any better"
"60663","Spotify",2016-08-28,5,"We love and use Prime and also Spotify for stuff Prime has not available free. Louder too than Prime. Great option to Amazon prime music, nice app.We love and use Prime and also Spotify for stuff Prime has not available free. Louder too than Prime.We got the trial subscription for dollar 1/3 months and dollar 7 / mo thereafter. worth it."
"60667","Spotify",2017-02-28,4,"Oldies but Goodies So far have enjoyed listening to music that I haven't got to hear in a while."
"60669","Spotify",2015-02-20,3,"Great Music - not so great app performance The music end of things is excellent - variety, choices, interface. The system requirements when running on a very new PC is ridiculous. It uses a large portion of your systems resources, so everything else acts oddly and sluggish. I like the mobile app, it has it is flakes also. But overall the Premium version of this app is decent."
"60670","Spotify",2014-12-27,5,"A great app to use every day! I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song minus Taylor swift and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you are in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."
"60671","Spotify",2017-05-24,4,"Love it I like this put the only problem is that when u play the music it go away. Like I am a lazy person I have to go to spotify and put the song again 😧 the music erases every time"
"60674","Spotify",2016-11-03,5,"I LOVE IT. Now I can organize all my music ... Finally got a membership with Spotify and let me just say, I LOVE IT. Now I can organize all my music into playlists for when I am driving and it is been really helpful. I love the fact that they reccomend undiscovered artists through their playlists so I can find new songs to perform and listen to."
"60675","Spotify",2017-07-14,5,"Five Stars love it"
"60676","Spotify",2017-06-05,5,"SPODIFI Spotify is a very good app you only have to watch a 20 second add and then you can listen to music for 30 minutes you can listen to any song when you want and there is no max skip like I heart😎😎😎😳😳😳😳😁😁😁😀😀😀☺☺☺😮😮😮"
"60677","Spotify",2017-05-31,5,"The best variety of music I like the quality and variety of music you have so I like this app a lot. But I do not buy premium so I deal with a ton of adds but I still like the app anyway."

"60679","Spotify",2017-03-24,4,"great app I love it but... It has a few bugs to work out. I use this app daily and I love it. The ads are kinda annoying and the 30 minutes with no ads is not always 30 minutes. Other than that I love it"
"60680","Spotify",2017-05-14,5,"Absolutely Positively Fantastic!!! I love it! I have found everything I have looked for from the Beatles to the Lemon Pipers to Scott Joplin and John Coltrane and Itzhak Perlman!!!!"
"60683","Spotify",2015-08-04,5,"Best music app ever! This amazon version is way better than the phone version. On the phone version you can only save your favorite songs then have them shuffled. You can not pick what ever song you want. However, on this app, you can choose whatever song you want, shuffle the music, all with just a few ads every 30 minutes."
"60684","Spotify",2017-08-07,5,"Yes Awsome i can listen to my favorite songs"
"60688","Spotify",2017-05-31,5,"VERY GOOD MUSIC APP Really good let us you create playlists of your different styles of music you like and have a library and not have to buy every song . When retired very nice.I know"
"60690","Spotify",2017-06-20,5,"Five Stars love it!!"
"60692","Spotify",2015-11-15,5,"Great alternative to using Youtube to listen to music--not to mention it is FREE It works just as well for Kindle as it does on my laptop and my husband's PS4. I haven't done much aside from saving the songs/albums I like and listening to them. The availability of some of the artists is really nice, compared to other programs that do not have the latest music."
"60693","Spotify",2016-07-18,5,"I see why everone loves Spotify I see why everyone loves Spotify. The only thing I wish was different is I wish it would let me re-order the items in my playlist. Apparently the songs stay in the order you add them. there is a 'shuffle play' option, but that is it."
"60694","Spotify",2017-07-24,5,"Awesome Great app my whole family uses it"
"60696","Spotify",2015-02-08,5,"Best Free Music App This app allows you to play music/songs. If a WiFi connection you can create and play playlists with almost any music you could want. By purchasing premium you can also download the music from your playlists to listen to at anytime. The free version does occasionally play ads, however two 30 second ads every 30 minutes or so is worth it considering the amount of selection and customization available for free."
"60697","Spotify",2017-08-20,5,"Five Stars I enjoy spotify music"
"60700","Spotify",2016-02-27,5,"Wonderful music app! I switched from I heart Radio to Spotify at my boyfriend's suggestion, and I haven't gone back. I enjoy building my own library, and I have made and shared playlists with a couple of people. I also like that you can add others' playlists to your account. I find this app to be extremely easy to use and plan to continue it as my favorite music app."

"60737","Spotify",2016-03-03,4,"it is amazing But... Its great I love it!!!!! My got to app for music!!!! But I think that it should make an update letting people like me that have a kindle. Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!"
"60742","Spotify",2017-03-15,5,"Five Stars Works well."
"60743","Spotify",2017-02-03,4,"Nice but one compliant This is a great app but my one complaint is that when I open it, it says I am offline, but I am in my own house, and,for some reason, I am only nine but I listen to songs like Your Gonna Go Far Kid by The Offspring. happy"

"60771","Spotify",2017-07-23,5,"Best one out here 😃 I have been searching for so many music apps here on the appstore but this is the best!!You need Wi-FI to play the music without premium, but this works very well for free!! About flawless!!!"
"60783","Spotify",2015-12-11,3,"it is turning into Pandora. The reason why I downloaded this app is because I wanted to play aspecific songs , not other music I do not like to listen to. I am sorry, but I give this three stars."

"60816","Spotify",2017-01-19,3,"It was great.. It would be nice if it did not get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there is ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device."
"60826","Spotify",2016-12-14,2,"Something Different Please? I simply cannot find my groove with this app. As an artist who has my music on Spotify, it is very frustrating when you can not even find your own music.

"60857","Spotify",2016-04-12,5,"BEST MUSIC APP EVER Way better than Pandora. With Pandora, you just listen to stations . However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to download the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."

I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can not play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app."
"60889","Spotify",2015-09-17,5,"obsessed!! Absolutely looooooooove this app. I listen to it in the morning, in the car, at work, before I go go bed.

Great except for not being able to move songs up or down in play lists or see play times from android tablets.

"60945","Spotify",2016-03-18,3,"Need something better I like that I can create my own playlists, but the commercial interruptions every half hour are too much. Plus you have to pay a monthly fee in order to be able to listen to music offline."

"60983","Spotify",2016-08-28,4,"Nearly Perfect I love this app as far as playing single tracks, albums, and artists, however the radio feature is a bit basic. If the devs were to add an option to make a radio based off of selected artists this app would probably beat any paid radio app competitiom"

"61015","Spotify",2016-02-12,5,"Awesome! Great! I can get music I could get on Amazon Music and iTunes. The only thing I do not like about it, is you can not choose what song you want to listen to.

But it also plays and number 34;recommended songs and number 34; or songs from the album you got your chosen songs from!"

Is it possible if you can fix that?"
"61140","Spotify",2014-11-25,4,"WAY better than Pandora! Only one flaw with this on the kindle version vs. the app on my android tablet is that it will look like you have added a song/saved a song but it does not in fact save at all.

Now it plays suggested songs on shuffle instead of what I want to listen to. And let us face it, thats what Pandora is for."
"61178","Spotify",2014-10-12,5,"Best music app ever! For free, you will not find a better music app. You can listen to an entire song or an entire album. I first found Spotify when visiting the Billboard website and wanted to hear the songs that were on the charts. I clicked on the Spotify link expecting a sample of the song and got the whole song. it is so good free, I will probably pay for it later."

"61226","Spotify",2015-11-07,1,"Kindle fires are tablets!!! I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can not do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the tablet version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky mobile version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones.

After playing around with it for a bit I decided to exit the app and do something else.... but could not find a way to exit the app! I ended up having to turn off my kindle fire to make it stop playing music. I think the creators had good intentions but there are a lot of bugs that need fixing."

On the downside of not purchasing the premium package is the fact that you can not hear the specific song you have been dying to listen to all day.

"61400","Spotify",2015-06-16,5,"A great way to get at the music you like. This is a great way to not only stay up-to-date with your favourite music stars/groups/composers, but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones. The interface is busy , but once you get used to where everything can be found, it is very controllable and quick. A great experience."

"61473","Spotify",2016-10-21,5,"Enjoy playlists offline I love Spotify because when I am on a motorcycle ride with no service I can listen to downloaded playlists. Its worth the monthly fee if you ask me even though I wish it were a little cheaper."

Spotify is an awesome music app which allows you to do stuff pandora does not usually allow you to do.

"61511","Spotify",2015-01-06,4,"Good It would be beneficial if the phone had done way to see the music that is local to the device so that it could be used in 3rd party alarm apps. It would also be nice if there was a way to auto play a playlist or resume the playlist/radio on asp open."

So, this app gets a 5 star...... to the app writers and all involved in this app........keep up the good work!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!"
"61525","Spotify",2016-11-12,5,"Great app Works great!"
"61530","Spotify",2015-03-17,1,"If it worked it would be great Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just will not play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50 percent of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50 percent of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though.Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."
"61531","Spotify",2017-04-08,5,"spodify is amazing! Spodify is a really awesome app. It lets you pick from tons of music stations, and you can also make your own. And if you listen to it on your computer you can pick any song you want to listen to. I really recommend it to anyone who loves music!"

How come when I use the app on my tablet Kindle Fire I can play any song I want, but when I use my phone, the songs have to be shuffled? it is great on the tablet, but on the phone I may as well use Pandora, which has an eadier-to-use interface. Make the phone work like the tablet, and you will get 5 stars."

"61551","Spotify",2014-07-16,5,"Worth it Absolutely the best music app out. It is definitely worth the monthly charge. Fast response to the user for skipping and the search engine works well.

In the meantime I keep getting dollar 9.99 for the last four months and I have nothing to show for it.. I do not listen to the station. I tried it couple of times and was not impress. I use Pandora. So I would be real careful about using this no support app. I have brought a radio station that is not user friendly mostly heavy rock offer. that is all I know and they do withdraw funds whenever they feel like. What does a music app have that Special for ten dollars, nothing! BEWARE dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar"

"61571","Spotify",2016-04-23,5,"awesome This app is aamazing! It has pretty much every thing from guns n roses to dropkick Murphys both of which I recommend.

"61584","Spotify",2015-02-24,5,"so simple to enjoy For being older and not technology savvy, this app is easy to use. The range of genres is excellent. Thanks Spotify!"
"61592","Spotify",2015-01-06,5,"great but for mobile dev. limitations The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you are using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium."
"61593","Spotify",2016-07-03,5,"Awesome! A lot of people use Pandora, but I prefer Spotify for its hands-on song choice. it really gives a lot of options for making playlists, from radios which are updated and random to choosing song by song. To whoever created Spotify: thanks and awesome job!"
"61599","Spotify",2016-12-10,5,"Five Stars Works great from my iPhone to iPhone speaker. I love the endless music to choose from."
"61601","Spotify",2017-02-03,5,"Great service and app I do not know what I would do without Spotify. I have it on my computer and two different mobile devices and they all work together flawlessly. The little bit extra for premium is the most worth while subscription I have ever had."
"61602","Spotify",2016-12-30,1,"Terbil The worst add in premen fechers"
"61603","Spotify",2017-03-03,4,"Definite Recommendation Good app but cost a bit much for Premium. Would definitely recommend this app to music"

"61606","Spotify",2015-12-07,1,"Sucks There is multiple reasons it sucks, I have only had it for about 2 minutes before I noticed the and number 34;shuffle only and number 34; thing. WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?! You click the track thinking your going to listen to it, but the and number 34;shuffle and number 34; option flashes at you as if saying and number 34;you have to shuffle it to listen to music, retard! and number 34;. I hope somebody got fired for this. The fact that they think I like one song, so I like every song is just plain stupid. Do the world a favor and release something GOOD, please. Thank you for exciting me for nothing. Eff you, and goodbye."

"61638","Spotify",2015-10-24,5,"awesome Love the experience of approach music.I would really rate a ten"
"61642","Spotify",2017-05-15,5,"The Best Music App Around!!! I found Spotify about a week ago, and Love, love, love it. it is easy and oh, so full of beautiful stuff."
"61649","Spotify",2016-03-17,4,"A top notch app Downloading this app was a great idea in my part. The app like pandora had a variety of both music and radio stations. But this one allows the listeners to have a choice on what to pick. So if you wish to have a bit of music in your life than downlaod this app."
"61653","Spotify",2015-02-18,3,"A little better than Pandora Plus, but twice the price. It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over unlike pandora but dollar 10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."
"61654","Spotify",2017-07-19,5,"So good It has lot of song 😘😘😘"
"61660","Spotify",2017-05-21,5,"Just try it!!!!! Its reputation speaks for itself. Easy to use and customize. Organized in such a way so that you can spend less time researching new music and more time enjoying it. Five stars. Great investment."

"61691","Spotify",2015-08-19,5,"Awesome Normally, with this kind of app you can not put custom songs into one playlist like iheartradio or pandora, so since this app allows you to do that along with what iheartradio and pandora not mentioning a few others, it is definitely the best music app to have."
"61694","Spotify",2015-07-30,4,"Four Stars Overall great, no problems added from iTunes and other mp3 so all is in one place."

I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month. That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time. I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."

Sometimes when I play a song, it will not have any sound, which gets rather irritating after a while. I also have found that spotify on apple devices iPad, iPhone is extremely better to navigate and easier to use. If kindle can make the layout more like that, I would change the rating to 5 stars."
"61803","Spotify",2017-09-05,5,"Love the app!! Spotify makes it is so easy to get your favorite music and share it"
"61807","Spotify",2015-09-17,1,"really spotify? I was amazed with spotify at first, i could skip all the songs i eanted and i could play whatever song i wanted even without permium.Then i got the update... i am highly frustrated with the new update you can only skip a few songs and cant play the songs you want. Spotify WAS better than pandora but not anymore."
"61811","Spotify",2017-02-03,5,"Rylee Alexander I love Spotify. Whether you heard a song yesterday or when you were a kid Spotify has it. 🎀It is very convenient it has a shuffle feature and you can create albums."
"61812","Spotify",2017-02-01,5,"Spotify is awesome. Sucks that the songs are not un alphabetical order ... Spotify is awesome. Sucks that the songs are not un alphabetical order so I could find one easily but otherwise its great. I can find almost any song, any album, any artist"
"61815","Spotify",2015-11-14,4,"Turtles I like it a lot but the only thing that is bothering me is that I am not able to pick my own songs to listen to. If I click the song the shuffle play box pops out at me so I click it and it plays a whole entire different song. I also can not skip the song when it comes on."
"61818","Spotify",2015-09-13,3,"do not update I updated Spotify a few days ago, and now you have limited skips. When I first got this app I liked it because it was not like any other music app. You could choose and skip any song you wanted but if you update it takes that away. I hope it turns back to normal soon."
"61822","Spotify",2017-04-19,5,"Great Great!!!!!!!!!😀"
"61823","Spotify",2015-01-13,5,"Better then iHeart radio! This is far better then iHeart Radio because if you tap on a certain song in that app then it will open an album that has mixed music that does not even have the same artist's songs. I deleted iHeart Radio right when I played my favourite songs. This is amazing!!!"
"61824","Spotify",2015-06-26,5,"AWESOME!!!! This is such a great thing to use for music, better than Pandora in my opinion! Choose your own music from tons of different songs. The only down side is the ads but that is okay! Choose Spotify Music and you can listen to your music all the time."
"61825","Spotify",2015-04-02,5,"I love spotify! It has all of the music I love plus you can find just about anything just by searching. Falling to sleep to the nature sounds or thunder and rain has made me sleep much better. Waking up to my favorite tunes or discovering new favorites in the morning before work is priceless. Thank you Spotify!"

"61852","Spotify",2014-08-01,4,"it is good, but not perfect. There are a ton of things this app does right, but then there are some things that just make me grind my teeth. Really need to fix the inability to filter and queue a song and stay within your current playlist. Right now when you filter a playlist and queue a song out of that filter it lines it up to play next, but drops every song after that."
"61854","Spotify",2015-09-28,3,"does not work I got problems to update th app on 28 sept 2015. Up to now was working very well but from some days is giving me problems and today already is updating and Uninstaller by itself. So I have no spotify at all!!!what is up!!!???????? I can not be without!"

"61864","Spotify",2015-10-17,3,"Spotify This app is really amazing, but in the new version I can´t choose the song I want to hear, and that upsets me, but either way it is a good app, although I hope they will change a few things in the future."

"61892","Spotify",2014-10-06,5,"very convenient!!!!!! This app allows you to search music and save it to play later. Create play lists or listen by the artist, album, or song! The only thing is that you have to have good Internet connection and after the first month you have to pay dollar 10 per month, but you will find its worth it!!!!"
"61894","Spotify",2016-02-06,5,"Better than expected I was expecting this to be like Pandora, but it was not in the best way! I just get to binge on the artist of my choice, which is a beautiful thing"
"61896","Spotify",2015-08-21,5,"PARTAY TIME I have only one bad review for this. When I try to buy premium, it sends me to the internet browser and enter my credit card. I do not have a credit card, so I am not able to get premium. sad Asides from that, everything is awesome. I am able to find whatever music I want except a lot of anime ops and I only get a few adds. Way better than iTunes Radio and Pandora, if you ask me.If you ask a lot of people."

Spotify premium cost money BTW"
"61955","Spotify",2014-09-12,3,"Works on Blackberry Z10 but... It runs a bit slow. Before you install it, remove the SD card first to prevent probleems with your offline playlist.
