"2","Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"in order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it s just not worth payhing a year in advance for it lots of product but i just didn t use it enough to justify spending over a dollar 100 dollars a year on this plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can t pay monthly which sucks maybe if they started charging monthly i d sign up again the free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought but i never watched a movie or listened to a song on amazon "

"64","Amazon",2015-08-20,1,"bad on a current device but why would i put this on a current device? i can t give negative stars or else i would there is no reason this product needs android beyond 2 1 the best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player but this requires that you be on the most current version of android useless app it needs far too many permissions and is a data hog i believe that is why they want the more current android in order to assure they are on my current device "

"142","Amazon",2015-03-30,1,"i should have know amazon prime music/kindle/video was too good to be true i should have know amazon prime music/kindle/video was too good to be true like netflix redbox and any of the others like it there are always loopholes/limitations every movie song book i ve tried to download it wasn t included in the prime package i can just as easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free the same applies to music/videos looks like the only thing that i m going to benefit from by purchasing prime is the free shipping for my christmas shopping "
"144","Amazon",2014-08-12,1,"since this is still a new feature we will be holding out to see how it adapts we have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device yes we know only 1 device at time however the shuffle doesn t really shuffle the music will just stop without notice and the prime music to the computer and the prime music to the device do not sync since this is still a new feature we will be holding out to see how it adapts "

"149","Amazon",2016-01-15,5,"amazon music app is the best in its class i rate amazon music app higher than its two top rated competitors apps google play music and audials brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate immense library of music also amazon music app works great on fire tablets and real android devices such as samsung mobile devices amazon nailed it dead on with its music app woot woot woot for amazon "

"153","Amazon",2017-11-12,5,"five stars i love this app it even works with alexia "
"157","Amazon",2016-04-13,1,"the worst amazon product ever if i could give this app negative stars i would i have been a longtime amazon customer since the 90 s when the amazon mp3 app came out it was great there were free daily mp3 s and i bought quite a bit of music from my phone then in updates it would become sluggish but then you d get a new android phone and it would be okay but then there was the change to amazon music and the authentication scheme amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other amazon apps shopping and kindle it became unusable on my last phone when i got my current phone i tried it again and it worked for maybe a month before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and i could not access my cloud library or prime music amazon customer support for this is pretty much non existent they will only talk to you on the phone and then they ll tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling everything which is ridiculous i recently tried the app again and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason though the kindle app would then keep asking me to re login but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me it gives me a network error so i tried reverting to my backup of the previous version and guess what it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and i can t access my cloud library or prime music so i give up amazon i ve bought a ton of crap from you and i would probably buy a lot more music from you if i could buy it on my phone and be an even happier prime customer if i could listen to prime music on my phone but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company the shopping and kindle apps work great music works great on my ipad and kindle fire and fire tv so i don t know what your problem is "
"158","Amazon",2014-09-10,5,"great app and even better with prime music it s a great app and with prime music it became even better i really wish if i could get access to prime music even when i m not in the us that s definitely would make it the best music streaming app ever i contacted amazon customers service and asked them about playing music through prime music outside the us they told me that i must have a credit card issued in the usa in my amazon account to be able to listen to prime music even when not in the us i have deleted the us credit card and that what caused the problem "
"165","Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"amazon music with prime music i have tried downloading it my 3 units desk top is ok but does not let me access all my playlistsmy android only seem to have some of the albums but mostly singles from the albums listedmy note pad i installed it then i had a problem so i deleted it now it tells me i already have it loaded but i cannot find the icon to reinstall itall you seem to want is for me to purchase more music though prime when i can t play the music i already have loaded"
"168","Amazon",2016-06-22,4,"4/5 has a lot of music you d want it s improved now that my phone can control all music and can manage the equalizer without an in app setting but there are still intermittent pauses or breaks in music every so often but overall i like this app a lot "
"173","Amazon",2016-06-14,4,"four stars good"
"175","Amazon",2015-04-19,2,"amazon music with prime music very obtuse difficult to navigate and select genre which are very limited i had an even harder time with it on my phone it also says you can download music if you are a prime member but i haven t figured out how to do it without paying for the songs if it is possible that is fine but it apparently isn t user friendly "
"181","Amazon",2016-02-16,3,"it plays and allows you to choose most songs the 500 song limit is cheesy the radom function is not program runs extremely slow when adding songs to playlist"

"188","Amazon",2016-04-06,4,"nice perk for prime members for prime members this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices i was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime i primarily use it for the free music and free hit playlists also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card "
"190","Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"is not that bad the good: prime members get a lot of free music buying song is easy the quality is also very good like the addition of the lyrics the bad: sometimes it crashes i can t edit playlist without interrupting the music and i saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players and is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music i still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members is it wasn t for that i ll give it a 3 "
"192","Amazon",2016-01-12,5,"best music app this app gives you access to all of the music that amazon has if you are an amazon prime member you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you re devices there are stations recommended for you and playlists you can create by adding music to your library it s definitely my new go to for music it s like combining pandora and an mp3 player best of birth worlds "
"193","Amazon",2014-11-05,1,"can t download just to my normal music files have can t download just to my normal music files have to have extra app just to listen and had to pay to do that when i already pay for prime too costly for just streaming basically "

"261","Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"a grandmother with an mp3 app? i listen to music as i take my daily walk i chose this product because the fm radio app was non functional and at times pandora is unreliable the amazon mp3 app is amazing it s always there i like that i can create customized playlists never had one before the fact that music i buy from amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick i purchasedd an mp3 player for one of my grandchildren but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me i m not too savvy with apps anyway but i am regularly discovering some new capability of the amazon mp3 app thank you amazon for making this free app available to your customers "
"264","Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"would be great if it worked on my samsung galaxy s4; this app will not play songs from prime music before the upgrade i used this app extensively and liked it it now either freezes crashes or freezes and crashes every time i try to play any of the prime music songs the songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine so essentially prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment and the app upgrade has broken the app well played "
"267","Amazon",2016-12-29,2,"huge battery suck makes great app suck i love the app when i am using it but when i am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25 percent of the battery drain samsung s7 edge up to date stock fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non use is collecting data "
"272","Amazon",2017-11-03,2,"only if you are dedicated to the amazon ecosystem spotify is easier to use"
"279","Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"i love the idea of one place like prime to do i have rhapsody now so that is what i have to compare it to i have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody the difference is rhapsody is easier and i don t have to pay additional for a lot of the songs the easier to use would be to much to write i love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/foodway to expensive /shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime "
"280","Amazon",2015-08-13,5,"don t wait get this app today amazon music with prime music all kinds of music are passions of mine i am a prime amazon member but have to say; next to the two day shipping that prime members receive this is the second best feature offered i have the app on my phone my kindle and my computers they all work great and i have not had any problems at all with them the app has stations that i absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together i can make my own playlists with east on all devices you can separate each song by album singer or genre the platform is the same on each device which is great no further learning on each device i have over 6 000 songs on my app and have used many other similar apps from other companies they do not come close to this easy to use great app "

"2016","Amazon",2013-06-16,4,"easy to use the app is easy to use both for android and pc my only gripe and it s less about the app than the songs that can t be saved to the cloud is that when i purchase a cd on amazon only some of the songs transfer to the cloud in some cases very few of the songs i m guessing this is a copyright issue but it is disappointing nonetheless if not for that i d give the app 5 stars "

"2175","Amazon",2015-05-08,1,"blegh semi clunky interface realize that use of this app means being tied to your smartphone/similar amazon doesn t want to become a pandora and allow streaming through certain electronic equipment until then i ll remain a non user "

"2192","Amazon",2015-03-29,2,"a lot of hard work and it may function this is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn t it takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it and today i had to uninstall the app and lose all the music i downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading they were stored on my device fine but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums i ve always installed from the play store let s see if you put a different version on your app store i finally got a premium phone lg g3 that just might run amazon prime music but it s just that deplorable of programming please revamp the app compared to the rest of amazon this is atrocious "

"2224","Amazon",2014-09-13,2,"could be much better i expect more of amazon ui anyone? the only thing i like about this app is it makes my music available given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise they did just recently add a scroll where i can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter i am near before it was just a guessing game the app really works best on wifi and is spotty otherwise it does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres so i am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs if i search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it additionally if i search for a song i have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list this is why i only use this app if i will be in the car an hour or more it takes too much time to work it otherwise so i still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone "

"2229","Amazon",2014-07-28,3,"neh it prompts me that i need to be prime to use it even though i am already prime user you need to browse for albums every time you want to add music you can not add music like with google play when you just move the cursor over the album and right click to add to your library or playlist "
"2231","Amazon",2015-08-24,5,"best music app ever love this app you can not only listen to whatever music you love but you can also download a song to your phone or even an artists entire album while listening to that music and it s endless woo hoo"

"2474","Amazon",2014-07-27,4,"a great app with one major drawback this is a great app for taking advantage of the prime music benefit the user interface is nice and intuitive and accessing music is pretty easy if you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible then asks whether you want to purchase it so no 1 click accidental purchases the biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files this is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room if it weren t for this i would rate this app 5 stars "

"10981","Amazon",2013-02-23,4,"cloud player was mind changer for me amazon mp3 was preinstalled on my android device and i initially uninstalled it because i don t like bloatware however i got an email from amazon that said my former cd purchases were available through the cloud player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app i enjoy the fact that most cd s are automatically ripped to the cloud once purchased making my music available anywhere great product for free "
"10987","Amazon",2016-01-19,2,"great idea but annoying i was so excited about this app until i actually tried to use it much first off the music i download disappears all the time and i have to redownload which is a pain in the butt secondly the music stutters when i try to play it via the headphone jack which means it s practically useless to me since i primarily use it to listen to music in the car back to google play music i go mad "

"11001","Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"it s music to my ears one of the unexpected benefits of amazon prime is the music service that comes with it download the amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files you can stream them our download them to your phone they are available as full albums individual songs or listen to preselected playlists get amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it "

"11068","Amazon",2017-07-01,1,"use pandora instead this used to be a great app before they got money hungry as it prime member you used to be able to download a lot of music onto my phone and play it later to save data but now they ve updated it and i have to pay to be able to do that they are taking way too many perks away from prime members even their movie app is not as good as it was so now i just use pandora if this keeps up i will drop my prime membership "
"11069","Amazon",2013-04-13,4,"simple but helpful it s a nice app but there s not a ton to do with it which is fine because you re just listening to music one handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app all in all nothing bad to say "

"11090","Amazon",2014-10-12,4,"i love to use this app i love to use this app the downside for me is going to be whether or not i resubscribe to prime when it comes due i am not sure i can justify dollar 99 for this privilege it will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music "

"11654","Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"finally went too far i m a big again fan in general we have a kindle three kindle fires and three android phones in the family that heavily utilize amazon apps we have amazon prime we had the free upgraded cloud storage because of amazon music purchases but the cloud player really isn t worth the new dollar 25/year and the free 250 song limit is not going to cut it for us so we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music the amazon mp3 app itself was ok but never great leaving it is not a hard decision initially i had imported all our music from itunes it copied the playlists but nit the folder hierarchy so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess streaming worked ok but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection so i ended up copying my most listened to music to my sd card and the built in music player works very well "
"11657","Amazon",2013-09-08,1,"foolish so am i losing my hearing that i decide to use chinese ? ?dare u stop watching movies when u start talking thai ? ?"
"11659","Amazon",2015-07-22,3,"haven t used it yet i must go neutral on this i can t really rate it properly as i have yet to utilize prime music i have not once accessed the app or even listened to it i m sure it s great i ve just yet to access it "
"11662","Amazon",2016-10-11,3,"no longer works with android auto had install issues and was directed to install audible why? nonetheless it worked yea however after getting into my car realized it no longer works our even shows up on android auto not my typical experience with amazon so 3 stars for release quality control "
"11663","Amazon",2012-09-29,2,"love the service; the app is limiting i basically just use this app for shopping or downloading the irritating issue with this app is that you cannot set the default download location as a result if you have limited internal storage storage space for your music becomes an issue it would be much easier to store the music on an external sd card with more space there are many users complaining about this issue for over a year but nothing has been done this can t be that complicated "
"11664","Amazon",2014-10-29,3,"difficult to navigate great service but it is very confusing and difficult to navigate some kind of sound quality adjustment eq would be good also "
"11665","Amazon",2014-10-29,1,"thinks i m in the uk the app thinks i m in the uk so no prime service i ve contacted amazon about it but they have no idea and are no help"

"11697","Amazon",2016-11-15,1,"angry i paid dollar 100 for my fire tv and dollar 50 for the game controller and amazon issues and update that makes me hunt through nested menus for purchased music that was originally accessible from the home screen updates are supposed to make apps easier to use not harder with more fees if i start seeing advertisements the app i m gonna demand a refund for my fire tv the best word to describe the amazon music cloud is volatile i literally lost purchased music because amazon stopped the album even uploaded music is subject to the volatility of amazon s music market if amazon made a straight up media player app they would not have a problem i download everything i buy because i can t trust amazon to keep it for me "
"11701","Amazon",2016-10-12,1,"was an excellent app till a recent update now it s crash city worked fine until recently and now it crashes/stops working 4 5 times a day slowing down my lg g2 while it does so tried uninstalling/reinstalling clearing data/cache and still does the same thing see that a lot of other people are have the same problem lately please fix it "

"11711","Amazon",2016-01-05,2,"it s not entirely terrible a few things i liked about it was i was expecting a bit more from this app don t get me wrong though it s not entirely terrible a few things i liked about it was the addition of lyrics to some songs and how simple it was to look for music and buy an artist s album however i did experience some issues the fact that when i was listening to a song and lost my internet connection the song would start all over and you re forced to listen to the entire song all again once connection has been restored another thing i disliked about prime music was the fact that there s not many artists only really known ones one of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information like no thank you i ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it took up a lot of space on my phone i d rather stick to pandora "
"11715","Amazon",2016-05-11,1,"an audiophile s nightmare as someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities for work as a musician and personal use i can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use force closes for no reason terrible organization storage and ram hog causes phone to freeze to the point that i have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through amazon prime i guess i m stuck with this crappy app otherwise i am going to use the slightly less glitchy google play music seeing as i am paying for this mangled service and assume some of my payment is going to app development i m highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from amazon good music selection but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn t work "
"11717","Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"luv everything amazon this app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that s bc it does so much i wanna address 2 complaints i read abt no external sd support and that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist and that made the app a piece of crap okay so 1st off 500 songs is like 3 days worth of music i have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music does anyone s phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot and prbly melt the phne so to me that s a useless comment and irrelevant the other issue: i like that all the music us stored in the cloud and it doesn t use any storage space on my device if u own the music u can download to ur device it s fast to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don t want to use data and you can move the folders 2 an external sd card if u have an android samsung s5 user here it works just like moving files on a computer the hitch is this: u can download any of the music u want however u can only move the music you own amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: mp3 and mp4 it downloads in mp3 if u own it then u can move to an sd card and the app will find it and play it mp4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage hopefully most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this so you can t transfer and steal music u haven t purchased i personally think this is a great app and that amazon prime is better than sliced bread i m a true believer "
"11722","Amazon",2016-06-08,3,"deletes playlists i ve been a member of prime for a really long time and a user of the music app since it first appeared and maybe the problem is specific to the fire hd 10? it seems to work fine on my desktop but i m not going to risk testing it either since i m talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists after a few weeks of listening to my music offline which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of cd songs the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased prime songs of course they are the ones i listen to the most flashbacks of digital rights usage? clearing the cache does nothing syncing does nothing support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music gone poof the option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the sd card with a card reader as the usb cable option hangs up pretty quickly transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device oh sure i remember which one is which since the last century the amazon music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? it would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn t it?reminds me of when ms quit selling music their player crapped out and amz stepped in "
"11723","Amazon",2015-03-05,1,"either amazon did not think to allow the transfer of either amazon did not think to allow the transfer of downloaded prime music to an sd card or it purposefully prevents such transfers while the latter is more egregious both are unforgivable a few lines of simple coding if that would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that amazon is working to do that are you? hint to amazon: free prime music is not free your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege second hint: even if the music is transferred to an sd card which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account so what does it matter? for your tens of thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory this is a huge problem we are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your cloud to listen to our prime music fix this glaring problem and this review goes to five stars because the ease of downloading prime music and the sound quality are impressive thanks "
"11729","Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"terrible service it has some good music but the selection sucks the songs i want are there for a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from i can download music to my phone or use pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache"
"11733","Amazon",2014-09-27,1,"there are better apps out there this app is an absolute mess if and when it works properly it will only work that way for a short period of time for those who were familiar with amazon s previous mp3 app which worked great this an upgraded version of that app that s just completely missed the mark i will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud so if you have created playlists or amazon prime playlists you can easily get those that s really where my enthusiasm for this app ends my current issues with this app: freezing this app freezes constantly i listen to music each morning/afternoon as i ride the train to and from work each time i boot up the app it will be at my last play point freeze give me the stopped working message and then reboot again always at the cloud/albums page unresponsive controls it happens fairly often where i will hit the skip button and nothing happens it s actually more like i hit it 12 times before i give up finally when i accept that i can t skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs unresponsive quick bar when in the songs screen the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works and it never fails it always stops working when i m on a song with the letter a and decide a song with the letter t would be better playlists that don t shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it always have to choose repeat and shuffle sometimes you just know the song you want to start with every time i hand pick a song i always have to re choose repeat and shuffle or it will just start going in order the previous amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection i will admit most of my complaints are when isolated an annoyance but those annoyances occur daily and add up fast the only reason i continue to use this app is because i ve invested a lot into prime and prime music i will admit amazon has me over a barrel on this one if you don t have a huge investment in prime music and you re just looking for a music app definitely look elsewhere if improvements and fixes are made to the app i will come back and update my review "
"11735","Amazon",2017-07-30,4,"pretty good nice app easy to use no ads good value if you are a prime member streaming off line individual songs stations thumbs up/thumbs down it has per existing play lists or you can create your own minuses? not many i wish it would remember the station i was listening to and return to it after i turn it off and then turn it back on again ali julia review"
"11741","Amazon",2016-01-07,2,"let s you dl your music directly to microsd; still no gapless play or equalizer still needs major work finally this lousy app allows you to download the music you own directly to your microsd card which i understand was a problem with android not amazon the problem occurred with many other non amazon apps that being said this app still needs major work dls of music i bought/own don t always work but there s no indication from the app that they didn t complete so you think you have the whole song and instead you have only half or less on top of that it is such a pain to try to delete and redl the song because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus it is neither easy nor intuitive as a prime user i m allowed to dl some prime music i *don t* own for offline listening sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn t the app won t tell you why there s no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a cd or album there are free apps that let you do this or let you crossfade which this app also doesn t let you do there s no graphic equalizer again there are free music player apps that do this "
"11742","Amazon",2016-08-12,5,"great music app many prime songs and albums to choose from you can build your own playlist and listen to it off line airplane mode to save battery life if you download you are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although i purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping however since my lg g3 updated last night 08 11 16 the app is missing and will not install from google play store or the amazon site thankfully i still have it on my tablet "

"11750","Amazon",2016-12-01,1,"how stupid is that amazon needs to make some major improvements to their amazon music app on the kindle fire series it does not work well offline appears the buffer memory is way too small besides not working well offline you have to actually tell the kindle fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online how stupid is that? can t amazon s own app on it s own name brand device figure out if it is connected to wifi or not and function accordingly? i love the amazon music service concept but the amazon music app currently is so sub par in addition when the amazon music app crashes you literally have to reboot by turning off the fire and then turning it back on again on both my apple and other android based devices in the rare instance that an app does crash you can wait a few seconds and then just re launch it not so with amazon music to shame also it appears that the amazon music app has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards i have had amazon music crash and then my fire hd 8 suddenly can t read my name brand 64gb sdhc card after the amazon music app crashed i ve had this behavior happen many times then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen again and then the fire hd 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days usually as long as amazon music app doesn t crash out again so that tells me it s not a bad memory card at all somethings wrong with amazon s app / device overall the fire hd 8 tablet seems to be an excellent low priced tablet but the amazon music app and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me amazon you re better than this right? get your device and app teams to fix this or i m moving to spotify and likely never coming back "

"12816","Amazon",2013-04-13,1,"the amazon mp3 app and music ecosystem is terrible does amazon understand digital goods? the amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word horrific skip this app save time save the dollar 24 99 annual fee and use google music instead google music is a competing cloud service free for up to 25 000 songs and it just works it s available from the google play storethe amazon mp3 app is buggy clunky looks dated and doesn t even offer genres for browsing through your library bluetooth cuts out frequently when i listen to songs through the app on my tablet the app design says 2009 and it eschews the android holo design language for amazon s awkward kindle theme the app starts you off on a screen where you have to select store or player and it doesn t seem to remember your preference so you need to select player each time you restart the app that adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen which disrupts your listening experience the app doesn t support genre browsing you simply cannot use your music catalogue s genres don t bother with the amazon mp3 app or amazon s music ecosystem if you do any of the following: 1 purchase digital music 2 consume digital music 3 manage your music library 4 value your sensibilities as a consumer of music the cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly web based you must supplement the web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions the desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad purchase songs and they re saved to the cloud and made available for free through amazon cloud player an ok start album art is 500px by 500px also great the rest of the amazon mp3 experience is problematic album art from purchased songs is massive a 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous metadata is messy artists are not tagged correctly and amazon makes no distinction between the album artist vs artist metadata fields album titles have random words capitalized songs are inconsistently labeled i need to re tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer so much for the phone app oh wait you need to install a desktop app to download multiple mp3s and you also need adobe air and you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs you also can t push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud you need to make a list of each updated song sign in to cloud player delete each song one by one from the cloud then select each song from your desktop and upload each song to the cloud if you thought you could simply delete an album from the cloud and re upload it you re wrong google music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience is well integrated into android supports genres and follows android s design language google music does this right 25 000 songs uploaded to the cloud for free song management is almost perfect the google music app starts up in the tab you last visited so if you were in albums or artists it picks up where you left off you can purchase music but consuming it is the heart of the app amazon s mp3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app s users go to it to listen rather than shop for music songs i purchase from google play have tagged file metadata correctly nice google album art is perfect web optimized at 512px by 512px close enough for me the app has genre filtering and browsing it allows you to randomize songs within a genre the cover flow is very spiffy i ve invested time in getting my album art consistent so i could browse music visually as well as through metadata i can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app the app uses the latest android holo design language so looks consistent with the rest of the android apps it functions great and has a lock screen widget pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on google music but nothing like the 80 steps per album amazon experience you can delete an album with two clicks after that it s 6 step process you complete once per batch of updates whether it s an album or 100 albums the cloud service is truly cloud based and the user interface is elegant and intuitive like amazon mp3 you need desktop software to upload music unlike amazon mp3 in google play you can effortlessly download an entire album delete it or edit its metadata from the cloud without the need for additional desktop software the amazon mp3 app is the opposite of google music go to google play search for google music and get started with an amazing music listening experience "

"25800","iHeartRadio",2014-02-15,3,"great access to music lousy ui reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content recommendations and application s features functionality and user interface in both web and mobile versions overall i like the system but hate the app here are the details what i like: huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music good album recommendations algorithm provided by echonest identifies relevant new albums to explore excellent autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks i e recommended tracks web interface is very usable providing intuitive navigation to the various featureswhat i dislike: mobile app s functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically and can be slow to respond to user navigation buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in wifi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups such as hunting for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app mobile app s features are imbalanced; on the one hand it provides a great many choices for user behavior social aspects exploration and discovery aspects recommendations at the album and track level etc but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc for example i have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are hot in my neck of the woods yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left side start up screen menu that i cannot configure much of the app interface s flow seems to differ from that of the web interface which is confusing transparent or disappearing control ui design in web interface while trendy these days e g gmail folder scroll bar is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it and since two finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic ui nav function that should be something you don t even have to think about "

"25827","iHeartRadio",2013-09-14,4,"radio on the go the iheartradio app is very easy to use and can be tailored to your musical preferences it uses the device s wireless to connect to the radio stations you love so you have to be connected to the internet or some sort of public wireless system for it to work i found it enjoyable to use you can choose radio stations near you or ones from where you are from if you are traveling it lists the artist and song title during each song so you know what s playing i found it does drain the battery considerably with prolonged use an hour or so but it s not much different than similar apps so you may want to keep it plugged in if you are going to listen to it for a while what i did like is the ability to listen to new music and to learn who the new up and coming artists were again very convenient way to listen to music and know who you are listening to "
"25832","iHeartRadio",2016-03-21,5,"best music streaming video app my only problem with iheart was that i could only listen to one genre at a time but with the creation of my favorites radio it now does exactly what i want without having to pay"

"25986","iHeartRadio",2017-09-24,3,"too commerical note: this review is addressed to iheart com not the app i have kept my all access membership only because it makes the work day go by there are many features for the listener to follow a song artist and stations unfortunately iheart limits its playlist to the most commercially popular songs so if you play a 60 s artists or station for example expect to hear the same top 40 stuff as on the radio this kind of makes the features useless because the subscriber never gets to discover new music stop using fancy algorithms to sell the product iheart "
"25989","iHeartRadio",2013-03-09,3,"not as good as it should be ok app but it limits you to how many times you can change a song from one you don t like to a different one this means that once you reach your limit you have to listen to a song you might not like that s not a good thing otherwise it s ok "

"25999","iHeartRadio",2012-03-31,3,"not very good the iheartradio app is okay but not very good the custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to pandora or slacker the app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds the interface is fast too fast if you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly there is no way to undo it if you do if it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations i would give this app a 2 but the custom station aspect of the app is not useful if you want to listen to the real stations i would recommend this app if you just want the custom stations feature i would recommend slacker pandora or jango instead "

"28171","Pandora",2013-04-07,4,"it was awesome original review belowcurrent version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs you have to register via email to use it now and it now has double the ads and they come in audio and video form usually in pairs or threes recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month this means that although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want this change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re download it they also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile facebook and twitter you still won t get that perfect song in one go but you won t run out of time waiting for it to queue up it s still 3 99 for unlimited ad free music i can t give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of ads i understand they have to do so to provide music for free but they are going overboard and the need to email register an account with them sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit i recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn t mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks like we used to do with the radio before lime wire and kazaaoriginal review:it has a great selection and variety almost no bugs and tolerable ads however recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month i could see an hour a day but if you listen as often as i do this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month first week tops this would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station so you won t get that perfect song in one go and if you wait to hear it you ll run out of time for the month of course you can buy the 3 99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay 99 when your times up to keep listening for the month but let s face it this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer meanwhile i ll be finding a new app "

"29005","Pandora",2014-01-18,2,"after the love has gone when you first meet pandora you get a light headed feeling you think to yourself wow finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of you two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact you start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you d get introduced to you mess around with different combinations of songs artists themes etc until you realize something strange is happening you start to think the worst is this too good to be true? have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop where all the music you clicked like to is constantly being played even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on? you start to panic and say well maybe the free version has limitations so you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together you take the plunge pull out your credit card and go for broke only to be deflated dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self pity and regret why? why pandora why?"

"43865","Pandora",2013-12-11,5,"pandora for your kindle i mean it s pandora radio on your kindle what else do i need to say? it works just like the mobile app ok the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app you have to pretty much go to your home page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap quit if you tap the home button it continues to play in the background no big deal and its a little weird to me probably because i ve only had the kindle for a little over a month "

"43869","Pandora",2011-11-07,5,"i love pandora and now i can have it on the go i love using pandpora and this app does the same thing after some recent updates they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me i use this the most when i am driving so i am not looking at the screen lag time in between songs is usually pretty good not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection but overall not bad considering that i m driving through numerous cell towers as i m usually listening to pandora lag time can also be due to my droid pro i have been having issues with it lately nice album art when its playing too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads and very easy to use command buttons "
"43872","Pandora",2014-02-08,4,"thumps up music app i use pandora because of the thumbs up down system and that the service itself is free the app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens actually most apps today don t take this screen size limitation or scaling into account and that impacts my use of the app otherwise good "

"43880","Pandora",2013-04-14,3,"its nice not the best app ive seen but its better hen other radio apps the reason i m giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that s why its amazing but if you don t like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that s not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips and also you have to have internet to use this app "

"44056","Pandora",2015-04-13,5,"great way to listen; the ads of free pandora are no bother to me whether on smart tv menus bluray players or roku/amazon fire tv or even cell phones/tablets where i have it but don t use it it works well and i have found some artists i didn t know about on various similar channels that i have set up "

"44085","Pandora",2017-09-23,5,"very great music and the cool part is that when you get a soundtrack it plays some of the music but it plays music like it and that s what makes it fun "
"44089","Pandora",2012-05-18,5,"music your way this review is for those who are not yet familiar with pandora once you create an account it is like running your own radio station you create your own channels by typing in an artist s name such as beatles you now have a channel that plays ramdom beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like the rolling stones and the who the basic application has no fees and in my experience only throws in a 20 30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs pretty darn good for free i don t know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create but i have at least 30 of them one of the best benefits of pandora is being turned onto artists that you didn t know about that are similar to some of your favorites all your channels are saved online and connected to your account so they can be accessed on all your devices computer tablet net box smart phone etc without having to recreate them if you re a music lover this is the best free service on the internet "

"44797","Pandora",2012-08-06,3,"ads ruin it i don t really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc i don t want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing you cant close them the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you d clicked on the ad itself i understand i m using the free version of pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them other than that good app "
"44799","Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"works well i use and like pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi fi initially i found this app to be annoyingly unstable: if i tried to log into my pandora account when first turning on the fire i could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before i could complete the login process or i d get a message telling me they re experiencing problems anyway there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and i really like it i particularly like that there s a quit option when i want to stop it as opposed to completely logging out after using the quit option when i want to get back in all i have to do is select pandora from the fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in the alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel good stuff "

"44812","Pandora",2014-05-02,5,"most helpful i started listening to pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists i picked they would point me to artists i had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection i will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard "

"53304","Spotify",2014-08-14,4,"the sound quality is great not excellent i use this on a daily basis the sound quality is great not excellent but still a nice quality sound for most songs there are very few songs i have not been able to find on spotify and i suspect that has something to do with the individual artists licensing agreements unlike other music services i don t have to listen to any songs i don t want to and when using the non mobile version there are no limits to the number of times i can skip songs i merely have to listen to a short around 30 seconds advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs the drawbacks are that some songs are not available and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app if you want to use the mobile app you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device and that even includes ipads and tablets still if you are using a laptop or desktop it is probably the best free music app available at this time and you can t beat the price "

"53422","Spotify",2016-04-23,4,"things to be worked on spotify is a great app for listening to your favorite songs being able tomake playlists that have songs you already like gives it a slight edge over pandora since both are free and use ads to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really comes down to whether you feel knowing what songs are going to play versus getting introduced to new songs you might like while spotify does both it doesn t really do the latter as often where pandora is entirely that really it comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for if you want to know what is going to play based on a playlist you created go with spotify but if you want more of a radio deal go pandora both have things they could improve on now as for both apps premium upgrades spotify in my opinion has more bang for your buck you have the ability to skip and amount of songs peak and see what is up next have no ads and download songs or playlists to your device for offline listening this means you don t have to have signal nor do you have to use so much data in my own opinion spotify and pandora are great apps for the type of music provider they are honestly if you can t choose between them get both if you already do and what to go premium on one go with spotify because it offers more in my opinion although it is more expensive than pandora "

"58777","Spotify",2016-01-26,4,"great depending on genre not for me spotify if you re familiar with and number 34;americas top 40 hits and number 34; u can keep up easily with pop songs it s perfect for that also great for relaxed order of songs and if you re ok with limits to skips i myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40 in summary compared to apps like rdio and pandora it s a big one up for pop songs but if you re after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go "
"58782","Spotify",2017-04-01,3,"amazing app but please fix its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug"
"58783","Spotify",2015-12-20,3,"its okay i said i s okay because at first when i got i was so happy because now i could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so i downloaded it to my iphone but when i clicked a song it would play another song and i found that very anoyoing and once i was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and i tryed to quickly turn it of however when i use spotifiy on my ipad it always plays the song that i want to hear it always plays that song but then there s an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now i don t know if its my only my iphone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying"
"58785","Spotify",2016-08-20,5,"get premium its worth it for some spotify has replaced my itunes now some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless however there are benefits to this service not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player the ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome if you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it if you re already purchasing and download more than 10 songs a month you ll save money with this service "
"58787","Spotify",2015-09-14,3,"decent but not perfect i really like the idea and i have a wonderful playlist of songs i like but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played a little frustrating "
"58790","Spotify",2015-09-14,2,"spandora will not let you choose what song you want to play for a little while it will let you get addicted to it but after that it takes those privileges away it makes you put it on shuffle and makes you wait for the song you want to come on spotify will not even let you listen to just that album it will insert and number 34;suggested and number 34; songs every other song unless you pay 10 00 a month spotify is not much better than pandora spotify will also sometimes get stuck on an add and you will have to shut down your device to restart spotify and continue to play music in summary it is just as worth it to get the free version of pandora as the free version of spotify "
"58791","Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"best music streaming service spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over pandora any day you can listen to full albums heck even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to from all your favorite artists / bands if you buy the spotify premium service you re able to listen to your music commercial free "

"58807","Spotify",2015-12-05,2,"sticking with pandora my 7 day free trial ended once your trial ends spotify stinks when you go to your playlists or radio stations they start playing random stuff for example: i was on ariana grande radio and they started playing timbaland and nelly furtado you should stick with pandora "
"58808","Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"change it back i started out with this app a few months ago it was the best one i had so far soon after i got it though they updated it to where only and number 34;premium subscribers and number 34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist i miss that version and want more for us free subscribers i get you have to make money a somwhere but come on don t tease us for a bit then take it away other than that a pretty decent app "

"58812","Spotify",2015-02-22,2,"not allowing me to pay for premium i would appreciate spotify music more if it allowed me to use by visa debit card to pay for premium monthly can you imagine that i am willing to make a monthly payment for this service and just because i m in the caribbean i am restricted and then it seems that when they noticed that i am not from any of the approved regions i assume they figured that out after i entered my card info i got locked out of my account all together stupse so i am annoyed when they get their act together i most likely would give a higher rating smh to think people bout the place pirating and i am willing to pay and here strugglin stupse "

"58822","Spotify",2017-04-18,5,"everything is great it s just the ads the app is overall great it lets me pick my own music and makes custom playlists for the music i like which is pretty amazing i ve been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me but there s just one thing i hate to go threw the adsi just hate that tormenting man s voice that just goes the next 30 minutes are add free thanks to are following sponsors i like it because i can just watch the short ad video then i can get back to enjoying my music time but i can t play the ad it just freezes my app and takes forever to load which sucks a lot since i m a music loversometimes if i m lucky see i caps the word luckythe ad might play but other times it doesn t play at all which freakin stinks anyway i don t know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these i just hope not that one random person who s ranting on a app about ads how pathetic"
"58823","Spotify",2015-10-19,3,"uh this app was great we all know it but suddenly out of the blue came an update because i hadn t updated the app it was pretty glitchy due to that i updated it now whenever i play music and swap to another app it crashes the music completely stops before the most recent update came out it was fine because of this i would rate it one star but i m not going to because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well i would recommend this app but they should really fix the bugs in the next update "
"58825","Spotify",2016-06-12,5,"omg best app ever i love it u can listen to the music easily and quickly and iove how u can make ur own play list but i wish it was for free for u to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but i loveee itt "
"58830","Spotify",2017-02-16,5,"amazing amazing a lot better than pandora"
"58834","Spotify",2015-01-09,2,"try something else desktop spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips mobile spotify is a different story 90 percent of the time i use spotify when i m out and can t access my computer and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge it s less shuffle and more like radio since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there the idea of going ad free offline functionality and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something "
"58836","Spotify",2015-09-15,2,"used to like it and one point the app recognised my 7 and number 34; kindle as a tablet which i mean isn t it??? and i could choose a song i still had adds bit i didn t have to just shuffle then one day the app updated and my kindle was recognised as a mobile device and i can only shuffle so i just got tired of only getting recommended songs i just use youtube or soundcloud even pandora "
"58838","Spotify",2016-09-04,4,"4 stars i gave this 4 stars for one reason there are times when i m listening to a song and then out of the blue it just cuts off why does this happen? i can be enjoying a real good song that i added to my up next listen and minutes later it just shifts songs without notice really annoying over all i love spotify fix this problem and i ll be golden :"
"58842","Spotify",2014-12-25,4,"great app love this app much better than pandora in my opinion because you can make your own playlist with your favorite songs only fault is that you have to buy a premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want you can only shuffle otherwise you have a limited amount of skips but more it seems than pandora they have all the songs i want even the most unknown to the people around me over all a really fantastic app update: there was an update on my kindle fire hd and now i can pick whatever songs i want to play whenever i want to play them "

"58855","Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um well well sometimes i will go on it and it never loads what i mean by this is that i only get a gray screen also sometimes there are ads that i don t mind but they pause and can t play so this means no music now back to that gray screen i have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again now the music is great and all if you like rock like me then listen to linkin park in the end numb and no more sorrow you also need to listen to headstrong these songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock "

"58863","Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"spotify is cool spotify offers a wide range of music podcasts and audio books the ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me listening to new albums from artists like troye sivan and years and years is pretty neat and the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music the only problem with spotify is some of the glitching i ve experienced with android tablets other than that spotify is cool "

"59912","Spotify",2015-07-17,4,"i love this app but was getting tired of pandora so i hopped over to spotify overall i love it i have the ability to choose the exact songs i want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music which btw is great i can easily access songs artists and albums through the my music section and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations i have hundreds of songs which i can access anytime as long as i have a wifi connection and i m glad the music continues to play when the screen is off i use the app on a firehdi do however have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason i am dropping the rating from five stars to four if i am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time it s most likely to happen while i m on the web the music will sometimes stop playing completely and i have to go back to to the app and reselect the song which btw counts as a and number 34;skip and number 34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough will trigger an add another similar problem involves the adds themselves: sometimes an intro to an add will play fyi i find these intros extremely annoying and useless and the add itself will not play even if i choose to play it other times the add will just stop playing mid way through on both of these occasions i cannot access any music and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program which when i reopen the app i am gifted with another add however through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches i continue to thoroughly enjoy this app and i encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try "
"59913","Spotify",2017-04-29,1,"i wish i could give this 0 stars😤 get rid of upgrade do not get this app it sucks the stupid upgrade that i have to get ruins everything because there is no upgrade anywhere ever since they asked for the new upgrade you have to get they don t let you play songs at least not a song you want to play you can t download anything play any songs on your playlists i ve had this app for 3 years yet they just lost a loyal customer get rid of the upgrade jerks spotify is going down😤"

"59919","Spotify",2015-10-28,1,"randomly alters what you can do with it i used to love the free version of spotify until it randomly stopped letting me listen to music unless i added it to a playlist instead of playing in any chronological order i have to shuffle my music so it is bassicaly the same as any other bad music app that ive tried in order to regain the abillity to listen to songs by clicking on them i would have to pay for a premium subscription just another scam to get people to buy something "
"59921","Spotify",2014-08-08,5,"coolio spotify is amazingly amazing i would say it is much better than pandora and iheart radio you can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on you can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs you can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists all the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio they have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too you have lots more skips than on pandora and i heart you can lots of stations and you can put it as background music you can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing it helps save battery you can also follow groups and singers so you can see when they have new music out i love spotify at loviemonsters "
"59925","Spotify",2016-07-17,5,"love it i used to use pandora but i like spotify better i didn t really like pandora cuz you couldn t listen to the songs you wanted to listen to at that time on spotify i can listen to the music i want to listen to any time i can listen to my favorite artists like melanie martinez twenty one pilots and hasley this is probably the best music app ever 😝"

"60055","Spotify",2015-01-01,1,"deleted free to download and the it deleted free to download and the it costs"
"60056","Spotify",2015-11-02,1,"was good but then the update came so i ve had spotify for a few months now and i ve loved every bit of it a few days ago though it locked my songs and wouldn t let me click on them and i could only press shuffle and only skip a certain number of songs not cool spotify if you want to keep your users and keep your ratings high please go back to the older version everybody likes that one better i m going to delete my profile on spotify and find a better app spotify is turning into pandora"
"60058","Spotify",2017-06-05,5,"its better than anything i actually use spotify un my ps4 to hear music while gaming this app is awesome because it also has playlists that have the música u da music u want so u dont have to change the music everytime its awesome 😎👍"
"60059","Spotify",2014-06-26,1,"sucks never ever get this spotify for kindle fire hd because it won t let you press the song you want to play you have to always press shuffle play if you want a good app to play music i suggest pandora don t get spotify "
"60062","Spotify",2015-11-06,1,"really? so this app used to be awesome you could listen to whatever music you want except there would be ads which is fine because i didn t have premium i still didn t want to get premium because i don t necessarily feel like paying 9 bucks a month just to listen to music but recently they changed everything now you can t listen to a freaking song without hitting and number 34;shuffle play and number 34; and after that it gives you other songs that you don t even like and it doesn t let you listen to your own songs now you can t skip either and you can only listen to 1 freaking song on your playlist then it starts playing the suggested songs which you can t skip seriously? now it d just making it so you have to upgrade what s the freaking point anyway? you can just use youtube and make playlists don t get spotlight unless you get premium "
"60065","Spotify",2014-07-28,2,"read this before getting app if i could figure out how to get premium i d rate it 5 stars without premium it s terrible when you try to activate a premium feature it just tells you that you can t activate it it doesn t even tell you how to get premium and i can t find the premium option anywhere unless you know how to get premium do not get this app because it will be a waste of time "
"60072","Spotify",2017-06-03,3,"great on laptops sucks mobile had the app on my phone wouldn t let me play my playlists at all only on shuffle play like it better on kindle and on a laptop no problems there "
"60075","Spotify",2015-11-05,4,"eureka where have you been all my life? i was introduced to spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it i have a very eclectic taste in music and spotify allows me to sample search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment i particularly like the discover function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections but does delve into areas i had not previously encountered that route has introduced me to performers i had never heard of in the past and my past is pretty extensive also spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that i particularly like i use only the free download so i do have to listen to short commercials now and again and they are repetitious but since most of my music listening is via radio that is no biggie i highly recommend spotify to music listeners of any genre>"
"60076","Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"omg it s the best and nothing else is it works well on a tablet so get it it may ask you for a email"
"60078","Spotify",2017-07-02,5,"a great service up there with the rest of them let s me listen to song i haven t heard in years it s cheap to be able to listen to just about any song or group you can think of and create your own play list "
"60079","Spotify",2017-02-19,1,"terrible this is stupid and you can get the premium number this suck"
"60080","Spotify",2014-06-22,5,"nice service i like that there is an app for kindle for spotify because it is instantly addicting not having to pick out songs to play yourself i notice the app plays short ads where for some reason i don t if i use the web page on my pc maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads "
"60084","Spotify",2017-09-07,5,"music i love this music app i can listen to my favorite songs any time i want "
"60087","Spotify",2016-05-05,5,"spotify works great when others dont"
"60088","Spotify",2015-11-22,1,"was awesome it was a good music service until they made it like mobile where you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want especially sucks when you listen to bands who s albums are like books: meant to be listened to from beginning to end not out of order "
"60090","Spotify",2014-11-24,1,"??????? was happy for one day with this app loved it the it decided to only give me the option to shuffle there is no longer a play option for individual songs i don t want to sit here and wait for the song i want to hear to randomly play "
"60091","Spotify",2017-07-14,4,"great app great music app love the weekly discovery feature and the daily mixes "
"60092","Spotify",2016-07-30,1,"can t use it i tried signing up to use this app and i can t it won t let me do facebook sign up or email : guess that was aa waste of data to download"
"60094","Spotify",2016-03-21,5,"very good the premium version is very good "
"60098","Spotify",2014-08-04,2,"its like free i tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you instead it says shuffle meaning they mix up the songs you hear if you go to a premium choice which probably costs money you can have the freedom to choose and select these sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop its like free but at a cost when cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was we know you have to pay for cable but we don t tie you down with endless commercials has anyone watched cable programming lately? now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads pandora is the same don t want to pay we interrupt your play it s all about the money and getting more "
"60101","Spotify",2016-06-13,3,"was awesome this app sucks when i installed it the app wouldn t respond it was maybe the lack of internet in my house but the app is awful "
"60102","Spotify",2015-02-18,5,"worth it free or premium spotify has an amazing selection no doubt the ability to create your own playlists surf from one related artist or group to another in other words discover new music economically by listening to the entire track and to listen offline premium only it s a coded special file so don t think you get to keep it permanently is truly great for the listener however the artists are severely underpaid services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally if you want to do them justice be more than a complacent consumer and tell spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from hold premium hostage only get the free version until they change their ways "
"60103","Spotify",2016-06-17,5,"i love it excellent "
"60104","Spotify",2017-06-16,5,"the best there is i ve been using spotify for several years now and i have to say it s my streaming app of choice first of all you can find almost anything on it from music to even things like guided meditation or audio books so it s the first place i search when i hear about a new artist or song or if i m looking for an old song or an artist i used to love but lost track of over the years and lots of people from celebrities to critics will post special playlists you can choose from as well i m constantly reading articles that send you to a new playlist worth checking out i also love being able to use downloaded playlists offline if i m driving or flying too the app itself is pretty foolproof though sometimes searching can be a little bit tricky and you still can t alphabetize your playlists which gets messy nothing else works as well or has so much to offer yet "

"60114","Spotify",2016-11-18,4,"i like spotify a lot spotify became my go to app for streaming music i like the variety and flexibility i like spotify best when it works with my devices it does not work on my kindle fire i have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues they do have a tab that says feedback but it is a goat rope the app works great on my samsung devices but it does not work on amazon devices go figure "
"60115","Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass i love my music and i love having it all around me at all times and i feel like with spotify you can go on any device log in and listen to all your favorite playlists and albums and singers and i swear i m not trying to sound like a commercial or anything i just find spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music and without music i would be totally lost to the world so what i m trying to say is spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music new or old at all times and yes it has commercials but only one every 30 minutes and apparently with spotify premium you can have music with no commercials for 3 months for 99¢ i love spotify "
"60118","Spotify",2015-03-30,5,"spotify premium makes this the best source for music i would have dropped out of college fell asleep while driving and been in severe road rage induced car accidents were it not for spotify s nearly constant stream of music for me thank you spotify you re the best keep up the good work spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues i have been using spotify premium for over 4 years now i recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem i was having with my premium account and i realize why someone might not like it there are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version but i believe the premium is worth it if your e a student anywhere it s only dollar 5 a month and that s a lot less than a new cd i love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car work my personal laptop and even my phone it s just great "

"60164","Spotify",2014-07-20,5,"i love this app i think spotify is the best music app in the world why should i get this though you ask 1 its toatally free 2 you can get any song in the whole wide world for free 3 its partly a socail media so you can get followers and stuff based on how much other people like your playlists and songs 4 you can even listen to your playlist and songs offline 5 also there is remixs explicit versions clean versions and all of that too so if you still don t believe me try it for you self for frrreeeeee "
"60166","Spotify",2015-09-07,4,"best music app with minor issues this is a really great spotify app for kindle fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion you can easily access all of your options and it plays clearly with very few issues one of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online i always check and am always connected clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track also sometimes when playing for a long period of time you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play i tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song other than that i really like the app and i find it to be the best out of all of the music apps pandora iheartradio etc out there "
"60169","Spotify",2017-08-06,5,"amazing if you love a lot of songs and music well this is the app for you it has so many songs you can make ur own music playlist it has some ads but they barley are on lol i suck at reviews this also has radio this is so much better than iheartradio😊"
"60170","Spotify",2016-01-20,5,"better than pandora for sure i love my spotify i have the free version i use it primarily when i m working on my computer for music background or working out or working when you get to listen to your own personal selection of music you don t have to worry about turning the channel or hoping the next song is better they are all great songs because it s your selection you can make different lists too which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it "
"60173","Spotify",2014-10-14,4,"rock o bye spotify been using spotify for about 2 1/2 years and has always been able to satisfy the only reason i could not give 5 stars is that it seems to lack one thing that a number of other streams provide and that is a sleep timer and/or alarm clock feature other than that it s really good at laying out the new releases discovery tracks mood plays had used a competitor for a bit of time and was happy with there genre/ subgenre ui layout but after some research on spotify found that it has its own app that does lay out those choices so yeah may not give a wake up call or drift me off into a good slumber but would not choose it over any other "
"60175","Spotify",2017-01-25,1,"this app sucks i can t even click on anything "
"60185","Spotify",2016-07-17,4,"spotify is great but has some crazy making glitches i like spotify a lot but it has a lot of glitches when i m putting songs into categories or playlists sometimes it switches to the playlist i m working on if i stay on it a second too long then when i go back to the song list it jumps up to the top of it to the a s and i have to find where i was before this happens a lot and it s very annoying i have found many songs on spotify that i have been looking for for a long time so that is great the classical lists are very good as i have found augustin hadelich whom i absolutely love it has music from the early 1900 s the 20 s 30 s 40 s i have found most of the music i really love but i can t find any good stuff of bob seger s or solo by eric burdon which he has done lately i am frustrated over that spotify sound is fantastic even on my macbook and iphone regular speakers i am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed and i still love itunes i m sentimental :"
"60186","Spotify",2014-08-26,1,"not working on kindle fire i would love this to work on my kindle fire 1st gen but it keeps telling me it can t be installed don t think it is me have downloaded other apps and they work just fine "

"60189","Spotify",2015-06-12,4,"great but i got premium a month or so ago and loved the freedoms that came with it i bought that month with a card from the store now i wish to get another month but i don t have a credit card and was trying to see if i didn t have to go to the store for a card again five stars if it would allow me to pay through amazon the free trial is alright you can get a bunch of music and create playlists an ad comes up about every half hour not too shabby "
"60191","Spotify",2017-08-11,1,"secret overcharges horrible customer service first of all i ve been a loyal premium user student subscription for the last two years i thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions as well the other features provided offline streaming discover station etc however beware of spotify s horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally first i noticed that i was being charged a full price subscription dollar 9 99 for several months despite still being a student the automated email response by spotify s customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year and must afterwards be manually renewed there was no prior warning for this and i was charged dollar 30 more without the possibility of a refund despite still being a student i even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused second good luck using spotify conveniently abroad if you wish to change your method of payment while abroad your credit card must match the country you are in which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel spotify does not offer advance payments i e 3 months or more so this problem is difficult to avoid customer service is horrendously slow 24 hours to receive an automated email response and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly "
"60202","Spotify",2015-04-04,5,"beyond expectations i found this app on a vacation in france after pandora told me i couldn t use out in europe unlike leading music apps/radios you can create playlists listen to already made playlists or my favorite just search up particular songs artists or genres usually on pandora our iheart radio you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice after using this app i have found absolutely every song i ve looked for but one it works great but like all others needs wi fi or cell service but it s still totally worth it 5 stars "

"60266","Spotify",2016-01-27,5,"great for music however there are some problems with it overall it is an amazing program i would say that it is the best of its kind the most annoying part of it for me is that i think that they play more advertisements than necessary i know the advertisements are in part to support all of us who listen for free but it still seems like they play more than they need too usually i use it on my kindle and this brings me to my biggest problem with it if you have the program open in the background while reading sometimes the music will just stop after the advertisement plays then use have to open spotify back up and restart the player this can be incredibly annoying sometimes i will have to do it every 10 minutes now that i gave the bad i will let you in on the good spotify has an incredible library of music to listen to and it spans across all genres to go even further though they have full discography s of all sorts of indie/underground bands that you may have never heard of spotify is a great program and i truly believe that any music fan would love it so give it a try now i know that this review may seem negative but i just want to add its only program i will use for music like this i wanted to give it 4 in a half stars but since i couldn t i gave it 5 because it is way closer to 5 stars than 4 please give it a try "
"60269","Spotify",2017-08-12,2,"good concept continued weak execution spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save downloads continue to randomly disappear forcing people to have to download again and again a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks also they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres e g reggae it has other functionality issues too all of them seem eminently fixable yet they re never fixed "
