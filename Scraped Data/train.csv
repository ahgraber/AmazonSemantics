2,"Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it is just not worth payhing a year in advance for it. Lots of product but I just did not use it enough to justify spending over a dollar one hundred dollars a year on this. Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can not pay monthly which sucks. Maybe if they started charging monthly I would sign up again. The free two days shipping on products was goo thought. But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."
3,"Amazon",2017-10-03,5,"Amazon Music is great, I do not know why I did not get it ... Amazon Music is great , I do not know why I did not get it sooner. love it."
4,"Amazon",2016-04-27,4,"Glad to be able to get the music as a Prime member Love that you can download music as a Amazon Prime Member. Just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs. That is the only reason I did four stars. I am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people, so just would have liked a little more explanation. Love having the music though."
6,"Amazon",2015-08-17,1,"Not happy In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She does not have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify. At least that is a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile."
7,"Amazon",2015-06-17,5,"Amazon does it again! This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"
8,"Amazon",2017-10-04,5,"Five Stars Love my country!"
15,"Amazon",2017-06-19,2,"fiddle-y and annoying. Maybe it is better from my Chromebook Tweaky, kept having to back out of the app to change stations, fiddle-y and annoying. Maybe it is better from my Chromebook, but on my phone the app was a PITA and I probably will not use it."
18,"Amazon",2017-06-13,5,"Works well Works well"
20,"Amazon",2013-11-20,5,"Great all the way around Great songs,sound and great price. Not only all that but you earn as you buy. I earned one song of my choice for buying this cd. and the song you pick automatically just downloads to any device you want it too. OH first install this MP3 on your device. I installed it on my Android phone"
23,"Amazon",2016-12-02,5,"BETTER THAN ITUNES! AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"
25,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Amazon music for Android I plan to work with it a little more, but so far am not impressed. Too complex. Too many steps involved to listen to music, in spite of the emails telling me was a great offering is available to me as a Prime member. Pandora is much simpler and user friendly."
28,"Amazon",2017-08-09,5,"excellent excellent"
29,"Amazon",2017-10-14,5,"Five Stars Very nice"
30,"Amazon",2017-05-15,5,"Five Stars It very good"
32,"Amazon",2017-08-08,1,"Shame, shame, shame... I can not get it to work. It keeps trying to use my UK account instead of my US prime account. Customer service was less than helpful. it is a real shame."
34,"Amazon",2017-01-15,1,"IF, IF, IF this were accessible by dial-in , it would be GREAT. But it is not. So sorry. I am not rich enough for data usage. IF, IF, IF this were accessible by dial-in , it would be GREAT. But it is not. So sorry. WHEN will all the radio and music industry EVER learn that not everybody on planet earth can afford giga bite upon giga bites to download simple music to enjoy. GO GET a life in the real world out here will ya."
35,"Amazon",2017-03-01,5,"Five Stars nice jams!"
36,"Amazon",2016-11-01,5,"Five Stars easy to use - great selection!"
37,"Amazon",2016-09-07,3,"it is nice that comes for free but not as good as other music streaming services it is okay they have a pretty good music selection, that is my expense or at least with the music listen to Spotify it has more options YouTube Red has even more, but YouTube can be annoying because the videos take up a lot of space if you are saving them offline. But its nice that this comes with prime because I would get Prime anyways."
39,"Amazon",2017-05-16,5,"Solar Escape Outback Men's UV Hat Love the music."
41,"Amazon",2015-03-01,5,"Amazon Music with Prime Music is a great addition to my prime account Amazon Music with Prime Music is a great addition to my prime account. It provides a very nice selection of all types of music and the ability to select individual tracks. Well done, Amazon."
42,"Amazon",2017-07-25,5,"Five Stars All good"
43,"Amazon",2017-09-13,5,"Love it! Love it!"

54,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Five Stars perfect"
59,"Amazon",2017-06-03,5,"Five Stars it is so nice!"
64,"Amazon",2015-08-20,1,"Bad on a current device, but why would I put this on a current device? I can not give negative stars, or else I would. There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1. The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player. But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android. Useless app.It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog. I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."
65,"Amazon",2017-09-14,2,"Okay just checked my drive which i just reloaded three ... Okay just checked my drive which i just reloaded three days ago. On a 1twogb drive per month allowance that i end up with time left, I now have 10gb left after two and 1/two days. When you have to open apps to run other apps"
68,"Amazon",2017-10-25,5,"Five Stars works"
69,"Amazon",2017-07-21,5,"Five Stars Great"
71,"Amazon",2017-03-04,5,"Five Stars great"
78,"Amazon",2016-01-20,3,"it is good On a small device it is hard to navigate. It also does not remember what you did the last time you were on, so you have to repeat everything. Sometimes slow to load and buffering issues, but that may also be the fault of my provider. Overall it is good."
89,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"great service all kinds of music great service all kinds of music. would be great if it had a voice recognition to search for music while you drive"
107,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Not happy with Android app I do not know what the core problem is, but I have a Samsung Galaxy Sfive AT and T and I have another app that can track things like when apps restart multiple times, consuming resources like RAM memory, response time, and temperature, and for whatever reason, this and all the other Amazon apps have periods where they will restart anywhere from five to forty seven times in a five minute period. Amazon, you gotta fix this, it is not right to be slowing down a competitor's product."
108,"Amazon",2017-03-15,3,"Three Stars Liked it better before changes."
110,"Amazon",2015-05-15,1,"No lollipop support The app only works once per install on my 2nd Gen Moto X running lollipop. After a reboot the app consistently reports that my library is empty until I uninstall and reinstall. I am not a novice user. I have checked my authorization limit. I have even reset my phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixes this app. The fact that this problem has existed for months now shows that Amazon is not committed to maintaining this app and therefore not maintaining their music service."
111,"Amazon",2017-08-31,5,"Five Stars Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. five stars!"
112,"Amazon",2017-02-05,5,"Great app for prime music Great app for prime music"
113,"Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Prime time Amazon music is awesome! Since I am a prime member, I have free access to all kinds of great music. If you do not have amazon prime you should get it. The free shipping and music is definitely worth it!"
118,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"It should be free to download Some songs to download you have to buy , so again whats the point of been a prime member ? Amazon is trying to squeeze every cents out of us.<U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E65><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E34><U+393C><U+3E34><U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E32><U+623C><U+3E31>"
123,"Amazon",2016-01-29,5,"no problem I do not understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma happy"
124,"Amazon",2015-10-19,1,"Awful I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat."
128,"Amazon",2017-05-29,5,"Music App is BOMBIN! it is awesome to be able to take my music anywhere!!"
129,"Amazon",2017-03-15,5,"Good deal Wonderful selections, great sound....fantastic Prime benefit."
130,"Amazon",2016-09-25,5,"Great solid app with tons of features Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps."
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix Great its part of Prime"
137,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Worst update ever!!! This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely. I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menus, and too may ads. And I do not know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
139,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Best Music App Ever!!! This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."
142,"Amazon",2015-03-30,1,"I should have know Amazon Prime Music/Kindle/Video was too good to be true I should have know Amazon Prime Music/Kindle/Video was too good to be true! Like Netflix, RedBox and any of the others like it, there are always loopholes/limitations. Every movie, song, book I have tried to download, it was not included in the Prime package. I can just as easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same applies to music/videos. Looks like the only thing that I am going to benefit from by purchasing Prime is the free shipping for my Christmas shopping."
145,"Amazon",2017-03-06,5,"Love it I am enjoying my music"
147,"Amazon",2016-10-05,5,"A lot of good music This even beats itunes! You can get an artist or song with their search!"
149,"Amazon",2016-01-15,5,"Amazon Music App is the Best In Its Class. I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials. Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate. Immense library of music. Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices. Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app. Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!"
150,"Amazon",2017-01-01,4,"can not remove only the duplicate songs. Very cool, but there is no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."
159,"Amazon",2016-11-27,4,"I dislike the updated user interface I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user."
160,"Amazon",2017-05-11,5,"I like it It works"
161,"Amazon",2016-01-21,5,"Great. Have used it on the go . Works great, choice is vast, service is clear and... well, I use it a lot."
163,"Amazon",2017-09-30,4,"Four Stars good music"
168,"Amazon",2016-06-22,4,"4/5 Has a lot of music you would want it is improved now that my phone can control all music and can manage the equalizer without an in app setting but there are still intermittent pauses or breaks in music every so often. But overall I like this app a lot."
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five Stars Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
183,"Amazon",2017-01-14,4,"Four Stars Great app, has plenty of music."
184,"Amazon",2017-09-22,1,"Waste of time. Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expected way more from Amazon."
185,"Amazon",2017-03-14,1,"One Star The music should be free with the prime membership."
187,"Amazon",2014-07-04,1,"do not get this app I am a prime member and looking forward to listening to Prime music in addition to the music I bought. This app crashed and did some bad things to my Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet. This app does not work.i do not recommend this app."
188,"Amazon",2016-04-06,4,"Nice perk for prime members For prime members, this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices. I was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime. I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists. Also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card."
191,"Amazon",2014-10-04,3,"Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads. The Lady Gaga Artpop album I bought was half the price of Google Play app. I also noticed that Google Play matched the price when I went back to compare their price. However, Amazon Prime gift cards in the stores start at dollar 25. Whew , Wow ! it is a high price to pay for one album if that is all you need. I do not have a credit card and am on a limited income. What happened to the days of the dollar ten iTunes card? Overall though it is quite good!"
192,"Amazon",2016-01-12,5,"Best music app! This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you are devices. There are stations recommended for you and playlists you can create by adding music to your library. it is definitely my new go-to for music. it is like combining Pandora and an MP3 player. Best of birth worlds!"
196,"Amazon",2017-03-11,5,"Five Stars Excellent results."
200,"Amazon",2014-06-17,2,"Maybe good on other devices I have Amazon Prime, but the app would never give me the option to sign in. Also the music downloader would not work in chrome on my PC and even the music I took the time to put in the cloud would not show up in the app. I deleted because it would not work on my device. LG G2. I feel like it might have been a good app if I could have gotten it to work right, just based on what I saw. This is the first app I have had trouble with."
203,"Amazon",2015-07-26,5,"Great elections. Use it on my phone to have music in the background anytime. Great elections."
204,"Amazon",2017-03-20,5,"Five Stars Love it"
206,"Amazon",2016-07-07,5,"if you are subscribing to any other music service you are losing out If you subscribe to any other music service and video service like Netflix or Hulu you are going to kick yourself for the price of commercial free Hulu you can get Amazon Prime which includes all the music you can download or stream all the movies you can watch and free Amazon two day shipping all for one low price. Fantastic deal"
208,"Amazon",2016-12-25,1,"I think of myself as quite well technicall aware person... but this all is the most horrible one i have ever encountered!!! the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but five months passed and nothing.realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!"
210,"Amazon",2014-08-18,3,"Spotify is still a better deal. I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce. Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they Amazon still want you to purchase music. If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you will like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead. Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you are going to run into problems. Seriously, at dollar ten dollars a month dollar five for students first time Spotify is a far superior product."
214,"Amazon",2014-07-12,4,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works! This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error number five thousand twenty 'Not connected to net odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. it is a shame because of the amount of music available."
216,"Amazon",2017-09-05,5,"My best friend Love the selection of music. Amazon Music is my best friend. it is with me where ever I go."
217,"Amazon",2014-12-14,5,"I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders ... I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders etc, but Amazon Music is such a complete system, when you have prime, I have been moving to it. Thanks Amazon."
218,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Amazon is Great! Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I do not have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of two hundred fifty songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
221,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Easy To Use Love it! No problems with the app, and always easy to find my tunes."
226,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"good quality. Desktop app is nice Lot of music, good quality. Desktop app is nice. But can not cast to chrome cast, and not as user friendly when it comes to offline stuff like Spotify."
228,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Good music selection and easy download Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes."
229,"Amazon",2015-05-27,1,"Losses track of library I use this to run with. Only problem is everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out, sign back in, and redownload the songs in my playlist. Then as soon as I disconnect from WiFi it loses my songs again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very updating bug."
238,"Amazon",2016-01-25,5,"Super Job with Amazon Prime Music! I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music! I have just started using this service, but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch! An endless selection of artists stations as well. Great job Amazon!"
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App needs some improvement. I use this app all the time. Unfortunately, it can not be used safely while driving.On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel.A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
249,"Amazon",2015-07-29,5,"I LOVE BEING AN AMAZON PRIME MEMBER! When I first started this membership, I was skeptical with the service. two day delivery, free prime music, free prime movies. But boy was I blown away! My wife and I enjoy the Fast and Speedy delivery! When they say Guaranteed in two days THEY MEAN IT! The free prime music and movies are better than what I bargained for and for what I paid with that one time payment, you will see you get Soo much more! I am just regular guy from NY that found this membership to be a great deal!"
252,"Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffers, and stalls For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it does not transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I am not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
255,"Amazon",2017-03-13,3,"Needs easier connection to Samsung Multiroom. Nice to have on the phone, but it does not work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I did not find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home."
257,"Amazon",2016-09-28,4,"Wow! Totally Great"
264,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"Would be great if it worked... On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
272,"Amazon",2017-11-03,2,"Only if you are dedicated to the Amazon ecosystem Spotify is easier to use"
275,"Amazon",2015-12-02,4,"Great service A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days."
286,"Amazon",2016-01-02,5,"I love this app. This app has worked perfectly for me since I installed it. I can download music and also stream from my library with no problems."
291,"Amazon",2016-03-01,1,"CANCELLED Could not make this App work on my device, canceled the order."
295,"Amazon",2015-01-05,5,"Got to have Amazon Music OMG!!! The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used."
302,"Amazon",2016-01-28,1,"amazon sucks Terrible interface. Horrible when driving. Terrible blue tooth compatibility. Playlists dont always transfer. Terrible ability to scan for new music. Synching sucks. Slow as hell. A failure and disgrace for amazon."
307,"Amazon",2017-05-05,5,"Five Stars Good music selection. No streaming issues."
308,"Amazon",2015-10-22,3,"Not impressed. it is not horrible, but it does not have near the music selection that spotify does. It wants to charge you for so much."
311,"Amazon",2016-03-26,5,"Music,music,music!!!!! I love music and this is the best I have found. I can not think of any song or artist that I haven't been able to find. Rock, r and b,pop,easy listening rock /opera,metal. It is awesome it,s not like the generic music apps. this thing has so many options and no commercials. it really does listen to me and follows my lead. cool"
312,"Amazon",2017-07-22,4,"Four Stars nice"
314,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars I think it is great! Better than Pandora."
316,"Amazon",2015-08-26,1,"Worst app and service ever there is never any good ... Worst app and service ever there is never any good music to download without paying for it. I would be upset but its included in prime."
317,"Amazon",2017-07-19,3,"Three Stars Does what it says on the tin."
319,"Amazon",2015-02-06,3,"mediocre music service I will vote in the mediocre as ok because that is all it deserves. The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of books I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle. Otherwise, the Music app is below par. Clunky download/upload application and the service does not have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels. it is good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that is about it."
320,"Amazon",2016-05-30,5,"Amazing app! Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you should not have this app and should not be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music."
327,"Amazon",2014-12-31,4,"good- but annowing Prime option screen my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I do not have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us do not live in a city where it is everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. that is it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen."
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime! This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music my play list and stations or other playlists. Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would have given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
329,"Amazon",2016-11-03,4,"I am so glad they brought back the lyrics I am so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were. Although I wish like with Google music, when listening to a station, you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better."
335,"Amazon",2016-04-27,5,"Love it! Who can not love this app? I use it more than any other streaming apps. Skip songs as many times as you like with no restrictions. Download songs to device, save it to the cloud or just play from Amazon to see if you like it. I can not say enough about this app. it is great!! Sign up for prime and you will be loving it too!!"
338,"Amazon",2016-03-07,5,"Love Amazon Music!!! Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercials!!! My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However, you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership."
339,"Amazon",2016-03-24,5,"Very impressive I have tried many music players like this in the past, and this is by far one of the most impressive ones. It has an easy search function, and is smooth with no ads if you are prime user I am assuming. And it saves your recently listened to stations in one easy to find list. All in all I am quite impressed with this product."
341,"Amazon",2016-03-31,3,"if u want to find music u love and play it on your laptop i use Roku, and the playlists are hard to sync. if u want to find music u love and play it on your laptop, or phone, its great. if u want to listen to pre made playlists, its not great. if u want to sync to your roku. not so good. and you really cant listen to music downloaded from other sources like u can with google play."
342,"Amazon",2015-04-17,3,"Pros and Cons I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it is not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."
343,"Amazon",2013-10-08,5,"Thank you Amazon !!! I received a great gift from you I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs. It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs. At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!! I did not see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me. Thank you Amazon !!"
346,"Amazon",2013-02-03,5,"wont open on Samsung Galaxy II --- RESOLVED. I am Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get Exception number 151 and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I have written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"
349,"Amazon",2014-06-24,2,"useless, app keep saying i have an issue in my prime account while prime management Web page States there is no issue at all Really was excited about this addition but the app keeps asking me to renew my prime subscription and to go to the main prime Webpage to see the problem, when entering the Webpage there is no problem. In conclusion I cannot listen to my added music by using the app"

I ended up deleting it off my phone, but that was not because it was a bad app. My phone just does not have a lot of storage so if I find an app that I do not use often, I quickly delete them."

386,"Amazon",2016-11-14,3,"Great app, but it is got some bugs Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes does not actually download . Even though it is check-marked as downloaded, it will not let me play it and it gives me that annoying Internet connection required . it is happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything a bit, then displays it correctly"
387,"Amazon",2014-06-05,1,"Amazon , release an instant video app for Android I am ticked. Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices. Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content. There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening."
389,"Amazon",2017-07-29,5,"Five Stars Great app!"
390,"Amazon",2014-12-22,1,"Glitchy and will not close Galaxy S5 I have had this app for about three weeks and it continues to disappoint. Below are my major complaints.will not shut off - if I pause the music, ope my recent apps and click the and number threefour;x and number threefour; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this three or four times to get it to close.Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads twelve times. I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now."
397,"Amazon",2016-02-12,4,"Great music app I really love this music app. I like that I can search and find almost any song. I hate using the Pandora and other apps because you have to wait forever to hear the song you really want to hear.The app does seem to force close every couple of days. Most of the time it works flawlessly. Another benefit of using prime."
403,"Amazon",2017-02-28,1,"Junk As few features they have for yhis app you might think they would work, unfortunately often they do not. Feels like this app is just a marketing ploy to make people think they are getting more from Amazon prime then they will."
409,"Amazon",2017-07-18,3,"Could be more intuitive. The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion. I have one album downloaded, and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."
411,"Amazon",2017-11-08,5,"Five Stars Love this. I can listen to music while I study without all the annoying adds."
413,"Amazon",2016-12-31,3,"it is okay, but prefer Spotify's larger selection. We only use it occasionally, mostly for Beatles stuff. Much smaller selection of music than Spotify."

418,"Amazon",2011-08-27,5,"best mp3 player, and if it could play drm files it would be perfect Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. it is easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety even though it is already large in this genre. another problem I have which is really more to do with Apple with it is that it can not play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."

Amazon sent me an offer for dollar three and zero one hundredths in free music so I went to the MPthree store and accidently hit the buy button rather whatever button I was supposed to hit to get the free offer. Okay, fine, it is only dollar three and zero one hundredths but then I could not even get the MPthree app to work on my Galaxy three Android. I get error number 45, which I tried Googling but got no resolve. I will stick with the I Heart Radio app."
437,"Amazon",2017-04-24,1,"Greed has cost you a customer. I will be cancelling all subscriptions. This has been the worst business decision Amazon. I used to love the app and buying music through you. Now you have gotten greedy. I no longer can get any music i download via the mobile app to play on any player but yours. YOur app is ridiculously inferior to other apps. It is slow no matter if streaming or not...In fact, usually all i see is the gray circle of death rather than get to listen to music I OWN. i do NOT stream music. I am cancelling my subscription. IN addition, now when trying to download to my pc...there is NO option to download all. Instead, i have to click EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY ALMOST five thousand SONGS. SO DONE."

444,"Amazon",2013-03-03,4,"Good Not Perfect I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet. Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing. It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with. While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices. An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it. So far it is working well without too much difficulity."

I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I was not too worried about having enough music to listen to. However, the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites. I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out.

With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and Add to Now Playing . Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it. Please bring this back, Amazon. Knocked off a point for losing this feature. Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics. Bring back Add to Now Playing like Add to Queue from Google Play Music."

I love the music streaming but I do not like the movies and books prime memberships. It does not suck but it is not good enough either.

Which made it useless since most android phones have what like four gb of internal storage. I have tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I am one of the five people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I am lucky the music will start up again with no interaction like its buffering and this is not me streaming. I playing the music I downloaded . I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."

1012,"Amazon",2016-02-13,4,"Better than it used to be, and much smoother playing than Apple music, but still leaves much to be desired Well, one thing I can say is it certainly works much more smoothly than it used to, and the lyrics on-screen feature can be quite a bit of fun, and helpful, but the lack of features like Spotify's old Starred playlist been awhile since I have been over at Spotify and the fact that it is missing so many good, standard album tracks or that Amazon expects you to pay extra for them? Really?I am sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately four albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."

1037,"Amazon",2016-05-15,4,"just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app I do not use it as much as I should seeing that if you pay for a Prime Membership, one should use the service. Thing is, that after you shut it off, the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.Second, it is hard to find a specific album... let us say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you playlists of groups similar to the Doobies. So I will get my South City Midnight Lady and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. surprised"

1055,"Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"amazon has let me down i updated this today and didnt realize the slap in the face I would receive. the previous policy was to buy an album in a year's time from amazon and your new amazon music and your old imported music could live happily ever after. not anymore. now they want a twenty five dollar yearly subscription just to keep my already imported music on there. i love most of the things you do amazon, and this cloud player was previously my favorite. now instead of beaming about this service, which i have done for the past year or more, i will be expressing my extreme disappointment."

Amazon Music is now the only music app that i use."

1063,"Amazon",2015-05-17,3,"Needs Favorite channels, then I will really like it. This is a pretty decent streaming music player for my Amazon music content. I like that I can get channels with my Prime membership, but this app does not have a way to save favorite channels. It shows recently played channels, but that only gets in the way when you are experimenting. It really needs Favorites"
1068,"Amazon",2014-11-13,3,"Fix it Quick! This could be a great app, but the last update broke a lot of the best things about it. Hopefully Amazon will get it fixed pretty quickly. I use it on my Microsoft Surface to upload music to the cloud so that I can access it from anywhere.Creating playlists has never been so easy! unfortunately the last update seems to have broken this great feature."
1069,"Amazon",2014-09-25,5,"Made a ten hour playlist in about an hour! This service is outstanding! No more scouring around grabbing potentially dangerous material from Pirate Bay, not to mention the endless hours taking all of that and making playlists! With Prime music, just create a playlist, open their pre-made playlists, and with one click save the songs/albums you want from theirs to yours and DONE! Amazon Prime is the shiz, period!"

XBOX music is superior in every possible way. Even the XBM Android app is better than this POS. VERY disappointed. Considering canceling my PRIME membership now since price increase and now this slap in the face. This should have spent another year in development, at least."

I still recommend it because of the selections and extensive musical tastes supported."
1175,"Amazon",2016-09-07,5,"Prime's free music is a geat perk One great perk for Amazon Prime. Prime lets you download or cloud many great selections of music artists all for FREE. I say free because we use Prime's free shipping at ninety nine and zero one hundredths a year. Bravo"

This is all about David Bowie right now.Amazon did a great service in making sure Black Star was listenable for free. I will grant that. They did not have to, and that is a credit to them.But given that he would just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free? Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise. If I now want to listen to Bowie I have got to buy it from you? Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we are talking about here.I will gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now. Right now? Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free? For a few days, and then ended it? would not that have been the high minded thing to do?"

1372,"Amazon",2014-06-18,2,"I want the old version back! The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list. On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the now playing screen inside the app, but they do not work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth. The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first. This is beyond annoying! And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state. I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do. This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public. It makes me regret downloading the update."

1391,"Amazon",2015-10-25,3,"Ok but not a good as other music stations Not too bad but lacks a large variety in the classic country genre. When listening to their radio during a work day it seems like I listen to the same songs two and three times in an eight hour period. I switched back to Pandora for my music streaming needs."

1393,"Amazon",2015-11-13,1,"it is ONLY FOR THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT HOLDER If your spouse pays for Amazon Prime, you cannot use the streaming Music service even if he or she does not use it.

1427,"Amazon",2012-02-17,3,"Better, but... While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song ten times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song five tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO."
1432,"Amazon",2015-10-27,5,"Five Stars I can not live without it.."
1436,"Amazon",2015-12-03,2,"Uninstalled If you download songs on your device with Prime music, it stores them in locked format so you can only play them through the app. They will not play through your usual music app or on your pc. My guess is that it will not be the case if you buy the song. Either way, it is not a versatile music app, sucks your battery, and it is not even nice-looking.Only good part is that it sincronizes well with the amazon app and you can import the mp3 already on your device"
1438,"Amazon",2017-01-25,5,"PLeasantly surprised and a nice bonus for being an Amazon user Surprised I am liking this so much, for I am a Spotify girl. I find it latches on to my taste better than some other music apps I have tried."

1520,"Amazon",2015-02-05,5,"Works every where! The Best music purchasing service since Napster circa 1999; works on everything I own. I buy and a copy of the purchase downloads to my home PC! They music plays every where but it is nice to have a copy just in case. Love Prime Music.I just wish Prime Instant Video would learn from this app."
1525,"Amazon",2017-02-09,4,"Only four stars Only four stars because Amazon should come with a self help section for people who are addicted to next day door step one click service."
1527,"Amazon",2016-10-09,4,"I dont have to pay extra to stream music I love Prime Music, streaming is tricky with artist not wanting to be on certain services but most of the artist I want to hear is on here so it is great."

1531,"Amazon",2016-06-11,5,"Great app! Perfect to making customized play lists for running!"

1537,"Amazon",2014-07-05,2,"Disappointing... The application fails randomly and frequently. I have friends who have no problems with this app, but then I have a multitude of difficulties and am left to wonder why. The service would be great if the player functioned properly. But until the day the application functions correctly I cannot rate the Prime Music player any higher than two stars."
1538,"Amazon",2017-02-21,3,"Keeps playing songs that I do not like after I dislike them Keeps playing songs that I do not like after I dislike them.. and I would like to see more to pick from. I been looking for some AC/DC"
1540,"Amazon",2017-05-10,4,"Pandora junkie Way better than i thought it would be! And that is coming from someone who listens to Pandora all the time!"
1544,"Amazon",2014-09-19,1,"App fails even after tricky install. Per a chat with Amazon Technical Support, I had to load the Amazon Store app so that I could use that app to load this one. Then, it still would not work. They had me uninstall and reinstall, but same errors. THEN, the support agent told me that it was a known issue with my LG L9 phone... after spending 30mins troubleshooting."
1545,"Amazon",2015-10-27,5,"Five Stars Love the vast selection!"
1547,"Amazon",2016-06-07,4,"Four Stars Only real complaint is the limited library selection"
1548,"Amazon",2016-09-02,4,"Works pretty well, the navigation can be a bit vexing ... Works pretty well, the navigation can be a bit vexing on mobile, but the music library is solid, and building mobile playlists trumps spotify's free mobile app."
1551,"Amazon",2013-03-31,4,"Tech Savvy is a Must First, I had to download the Amazon Appstore. Then I had to download the Amazon MP3 Player. After I downloaded it to my smartphone, I could not find it. I had to open Appstore, open the menu, select downloaded apps, then open the app on my phone. It took me a while to figure it put and the procedures are well hidden. Once I opened it on my smartphone, I could listen to my ninety nine Piano Masterpieces fo ninety nine cents on my smartphone."
1556,"Amazon",2014-07-31,4,"Diggin' it Love this free service and the app is pretty good. I would suggest that it remembers what my last refinement was if I was sorting by Artist last time, do not friggin bring me back to Albums every time. Other than that small annoyance it is good.I have Prime so I have got a pretty decent selection of music I have added to my library."
1557,"Amazon",2016-06-24,5,"Five Stars A must have for Prime members that love music!"
1560,"Amazon",2015-03-15,4,"OK player, quality So So. Predictions here for music that I like were not very on the mark, as far as the playlists went.quality could have been better , definitely has some competition out there . But I would say good addition to Prime membership for no additional money ,even the Prime membership went up AGAIN!"
1565,"Amazon",2011-03-31,5,"Works great! The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I have been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem."

1568,"Amazon",2016-03-31,2,"The service did not work with my Samsung six phone ... The service did not work with my Samsung six phone. I feel this is an issue with my phone. The battery had to be charged after the download. I attempt the process twice and had the same issue."
1572,"Amazon",2012-12-27,3,"One Caveat This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with four and two tenths lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."
1573,"Amazon",2016-07-16,5,"Way better than I thought Way better than I thought. After years of using Pandora, uuugh, the ads. Love the Prime stations for genres. Skip all you like, repeat, great selection for any setting."
1575,"Amazon",2016-05-10,5,"Good So far so good, you can listen to music that isnt normally played on internet radio which is awesome, and you can always buy a song if you like it i just like it for its better variety."

Also, the shipping is very quick!!! Hats off and a bow to Amazon, so glad to have found this incredible site!"
1582,"Amazon",2015-09-29,5,"Streaming Tommy Emmanuel I am new to Prime Music but not to Amazon Prime which I use to order EVERYTHING! I was pleased to see how many Tommy Emmanuel tracks were available for free streaming. I will undoubtedly be ordering more TE music soon. Very pleased so far."
1587,"Amazon",2016-10-12,5,"Love it! I listen to it all day when I am home. And just learned that through the Bluetooth connection in my car I can also play Prime as I travel. Love it!"
1588,"Amazon",2016-06-15,5,"Five Stars Easy to use and convenient to have on my phone"
1594,"Amazon",2014-07-14,1,"Ugh. This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you did not purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your large music library is not from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."
1595,"Amazon",2017-09-05,5,"Five Stars Absolutely fabulous. Hits from today and from years gone by."
1596,"Amazon",2016-02-04,2,"Mobile Unfriendly What does a genre channel play the same songs at start of every play session? it is as if I have an old school mix tape and it is the same every time?Haven't tried via PC, but have higher hopes."
1597,"Amazon",2017-10-12,4,"Good App I really enjoy this app with my Prime Membership!"
1598,"Amazon",2017-03-17,5,"Five Stars Great! So far I have had nothing but good experience with this product and the firestick."
1599,"Amazon",2015-04-20,3,"Good, but could use a better interface. I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials, but listening to a particular genre is not so easy. It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also, not all artists are available, so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."
1600,"Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"The best music service we have used Love this prime service. We use it all the time. Especially nice now that we have the Amazon Firestick and can play music through the TV."
1601,"Amazon",2014-09-16,3,"It is such a disappointment as I like to listen to music on my ... I downloaded the app to my android tablet as well as android phone, but the music downloaded to my Kindle Fire does not sync with the other two. It is such a disappointment as I like to listen to music on my cell phone while I take a walk. If there is any way to sync the music with my android products, please let me know."
1606,"Amazon",2016-02-22,5,"Music all day... I love that I do not have to think too hard with the Prime Music playlists! There are all types of playlists and moods to suit the listener. I have been recommending this to everyone with a Prime account!"
1609,"Amazon",2016-09-28,5,"Five Stars Awesome music"
1612,"Amazon",2015-07-20,1,"AMAZON PRIME MUSIC RIP OFF I think it is a rip off that Amazon make you buy multiple Prime family memberships to get their music. I do not recall it being this way in the past. Now we have two Prime Memberships in our house just so we can each access Prime Music via our smart phones."
1613,"Amazon",2016-08-28,4,"four Stars for ninety percent Great app, but still only have ninety percent of the songs I am looking for. Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all, but until then.. four stars"
1618,"Amazon",2016-04-03,5,"No problems experienced here I have downloaded four hundred songs and have never had a problem, except when I filled up my SD card. I had no trouble downloading to the SD card, finding music I wanted, or listening to it. I am happy."
1620,"Amazon",2016-08-22,5,"This APP made me enjoy my workout even more I AM SOOOO EXCITED ABOUT THE LIBRARY. I have been able to replace a lot of my music collection that I have lost. This APP made me enjoy my workout even more."
1623,"Amazon",2014-11-26,1,"As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon, its Prime Music's desktop version sucks. So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms. The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I am required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."
1624,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Wonderful!!! I just absolutely LOVE Amazon Music, and with the added benefit of the Prime Music it is just wonderful!!! it is so easy to use and shop. The songs and albums are very affordable and you can not even imagine all the free music available with Prime. Love it!!!"
1626,"Amazon",2016-12-31,5,"Truly enjoyable! I enjoy Amazon music... The station choices are excellent and I like having free music available to add to my listening library."
1627,"Amazon",2016-09-10,4,"but the album sowing the seeds of love was. Other pay services have their entire catalog Lots of material gaps. For example tears for fears was there, but the album sowing the seeds of love was. Other pay services have their entire catalog."
1636,"Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music App Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice."
1640,"Amazon",2015-06-10,5,"So much music! Have found new music, as well as most of my old favorites.The play lists are great too.So Much music, so little time! I bet if I turned my selections on and just let them play it would take days to finish. Just love that!Thank youCheers"
1642,"Amazon",2017-05-29,1,"I could not try because you dont accept saudi credit card I could not try because you dont accept saudi credit card"
1647,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"Try it-you will not be sorry. So many albums and playlists to choose from in all genres, and all for free as a member! I use both video and music-a really good deal for less than dollar ten a month now, in my first year."
1648,"Amazon",2017-06-25,4,"Like it a lot. I like it a lot compared to other apps. Wish I could add whole albums to playlist."
1653,"Amazon",2017-07-19,4,"Four Stars I would give five stars but you do not provide enough smooth jazz artists."
1656,"Amazon",2016-06-19,5,"Five Stars Free music, sometime selection is limited"
1657,"Amazon",2016-04-26,5,"Features are above average All the features available exceeded my expectations -- from lyrics, to instant downloads after a purchase of physical copies of music to the display and layout of the music library."
1660,"Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music is better than Pandora Commercial free Radio. Skip any number of times. Many different genres to choose from. Amazon Music is better than Pandora, better than Spotify, and better than Sound Cloud."
1661,"Amazon",2015-10-07,5,"worth it! Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!"
1664,"Amazon",2016-12-23,3,"Not too bad... Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster Formerly Rhapsody out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you have already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I have found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the Downloaded section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the Unlimited category. Anyway, I gave it a try for one week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra dollar two per month is worth it."
1666,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"Love, love, love it!!! I downloaded Prime Music on Prime Day and just love it! Enjoy all the playlists that Amazon's created that make it super easy to pick several favorite songs in a similar genre. can not wait to download more music so that I can ROCK my upcoming vacay!"
1668,"Amazon",2016-03-02,4,"Really like the playlists and stations Really like the playlists and stations. Would be good if more recent stuff was included but when you look what you are paying for Amazon Prime and all the other benefits, not bad value for money."
1669,"Amazon",2014-04-19,5,"Love this app I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay dollar one hundred fifty a year for the service. I did not remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money.I am SO happy with this app. Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I do not have to pay a ridiculous amount or anything at all to use this service."
1672,"Amazon",2015-07-21,5,"Music on the go We enjoy being able to listen to our downloaded/purchased songs via Bluetooth in the car! Lets me choose what songs my kids can listen to."
1673,"Amazon",2015-06-18,4,"Fantastic but please read My last CD order was damaged CD case only.

1695,"Amazon",2015-05-01,3,"Not for my phone. I am sure it would work wonderfully if I had unlimited data or maybe if I was using an amazon device. But for my galaxy, I find that it consumes too much memory and streams away my data. I uninstalled for this reason."
1698,"Amazon",2015-12-23,1,"Will not work Keeps telling me and number 34;currently unavailable and number 34; when I try to download this. I am a prime member and have been a loyal Amazon user for a very long time. Please fix this issue so I can have my music!!!"

The app crashes and the buffering time is awful. I am waiting for some sort of update or fix."
1782,"Amazon",2014-11-09,1,"Frustrating Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I am extremely irritated with this."

As a bonus any music that you purchase from amazon does not GO AGAINST YOUR STORAGE. This provides a nice incentive to purchase music from Amazon.

1958,"Amazon",2015-11-20,4,"Get it. Worth the perks of prime. Only listened to a couple of albums and I have to say I am impressed that it is packaged with Amazon prime. I do not have to wait for the songs I want to hear. This is very important to me."
1960,"Amazon",2014-10-19,1,"Mac version of the Music Player is GARBAGE The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can not speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently read: almost always hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we are forced to use this player to download any music we have added to Amazon Music, I have gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.Other fun issues:Badly matched songs completely the wrong recordings - we are talking live songs being replaced by studio versions! You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the files you have uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You will not know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you are screwed at that point.Other than that, it is GREAT."

1990,"Amazon",2017-05-31,3,"Meh... it is okay. Maybe I am hoping for too much. it is functionality is nice. I like that I can choose Offline Music and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection to my car stereo is lacking. The full range of the music does not seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I am playing to headphones and so it is cutting back on the bass a bit. I have found some not many! music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can not do that with the Amazon Music App. It also does not show the time tracking of the track that is playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they would get on board with the Google Assistant programming and make it so I can tell OK Google to run certain commands within the app."

Edit=> For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently has not chosen to do so.But that is not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord you can use the one for charging. With your Windows PC and android device on signed on to both, both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC. I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named Amazon MP3 Mover that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.On copying my music from my PC to a folder Music I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit skip ."

I have even given them the firewall logs of my phone to show what servers, ports, times, etc the app is trying to connect to. That way it makes their jobs very simple to troubleshoot by simply looking at an error code on that server. They have had sixteen months and can not seem to do a simple task such as that. I am a seventeen year Network Engineer and do this kind of stuff day in and day out. My PRIME account is useless but yet I paid over dollar one hundred for sixteen months now to stream music.....no dice. I want a refund.I have spent over dollar two thousand dollars on amazon mp3 music and I can not access any of it.

That data cap will get ya When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free two day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I am still poor sad but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I do not even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had thirty years prior to make a living."
2403,"Amazon",2015-12-06,5,"Best app on the market Best music app on the market. I can listen to many good Christian songs and even download them on my phone through Wi-Fi to listen to later so I do not have to use my data."

2470,"Amazon",2017-05-29,5,"Well worth the time to install easy to navigate and use"
2474,"Amazon",2014-07-27,4,"A great app with one major drawback. This is a great app for taking advantage of the 'Prime Music' benefit. The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it were not for this I would rate this app five stars."

2745,"Amazon",2014-12-31,1,"Amazon Music App thumbs down. Down loaded the app and found out it uses a lot of memory about the same amount as the whole Operating System on the phone. did not like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it did not need to access. did not like that at all as it is giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I do not want to give away. Then found out I could not delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I do not need to give you and you do not need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app is not very intuitive to use. I will not be reloading it, and would suggest avoiding it, as it is a memory hog and bloats your data rate needlessly."

I can be surfing the Web on my phone or checking my email without listening to music and it crashes interrupting what I am doing. Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my musichave over three thousand five hundred songs mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over five hundred songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating three hundred of themover eight hundred additional on my SD card. So I hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I do not select report the crash the music still plays, however I can not see what is playing. I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal and a 64GB SD card. Found the best work around is to force a stop on the app and delete cache, restart the phone then try again to play music.Is this anyway to listen to your music? do not THINK SO!!!!

This used to be my favorite Amazon app. I was very excited when the prime music became available, even though the music selection was very limited. However, in the past month or so I have hardly between able to use the app because it keeps crashing. I get error messages constantly, I can not download items or delete items with the app freezing and its even screwing up the album cover thumbnail with the artist putting a Beatles album cover with a Rolling Stones album for example. Often it takes a bunch of random songs and throws them together in an unknown artist album. What? I hope Amazon fixes these issues soon, otherwise I will be deleting the app and finding one that actually works."

By downloading this App, paying for the cloud storage, and uploading my entire library from one computer, and combining that with music from another PC, we finally have all of our digital music available to play on the Echo Dot.We also needed to agree to become an Amazon Household which was one of the key ingredients in pulling all of our music together.

4529,"Amazon",2016-02-01,3,"Unfinished Product There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing. I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there is no way to undo this action. Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error. it is also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on. Rating the song on one station should not affect the other. If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I am already an Amazon Prime member. number AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me."

4976,"Amazon",2014-10-14,2,"not what I was hoping for. I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I do not want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."

I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years.I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist even with a name like Todd Rundgren the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."

Not possible.The upgraded player is terrible! It locks up my Asus tablet, cannot find my downloaded music - even the music I have purchased from Amazon and will not play my playlists.Geez, Amazon!

9710,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Zero stars -useless for mobile purposes, purchases still go to internal memory, deleted all play lists on my device. The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine, but I feel like I have lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising listening whilst in motion.You now have to stop, go to additional screens with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!, and take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc..Unacceptable from both a safety car and /or usability standpoint exercise.When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile eg: hear a song in a store that you like- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. !!!My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it is an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you are sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is.Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I now know that I should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc..Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.I do not sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi.When I am on a road trip- it is my bandwidth that is used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I do not need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I am at home, fine. But it simply does not serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it is incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I will not be using their app will not be running across products to buy."

Now mind you these are all songs I purchased on amazon. I do not even know what other songs I can not enjoy because they have been mislabeled and I can not find them. Please fix this Amazon so I can enjoy my music!"

10865,"Amazon",2011-04-19,5,"Great App, a couple changes suggested I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player. I have put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that are not mp3 to mp3. Its not necessary but if it did do that I would not need to open iTunes for much of anything.Great updates."

I then get thirty seconds of silence before the next song plays.I have other online streaming music apps on my Android phone SiriusXM, Pandora, TuneIn, and NONE of them exhibit this annoying behavior ... so it is not my phone, and it is not my network connection; it is this buggy app.Dear Amazon: you are supposed to be providing me with entertainment, not agita."

Amazon tech can not get it to work either. This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they are consistently late but they are late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS. ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!! Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
10941,"Amazon",2014-10-27,4,"A Must for Amazon Prime Subscribers This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available. Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus seven tablet and Android phone Galaxy S 5. Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services. The pre-selected playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good. I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account. I have not purchased any songs or albums. The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use."
10946,"Amazon",2016-06-07,1,"do not Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. did not get the song version right, cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!"
10949,"Amazon",2014-10-15,4,"Mostly great it is almost fabulous. I do not have an iPhone so I can not get my iTunes unless I am at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I am out and about. My one star less is because there is no way that I have found to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I will wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I am enjoying my tunes happy"
10953,"Amazon",2016-07-30,5,"A must have for prime members Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library."
10954,"Amazon",2016-06-08,5,"Get Yo Jammin' On! I absolutely LOVE this feature! This app is AMAZING! I really do not know how i listened to music before this! If you have Prime, or your thinking about getting Prime, get this app. You wont regret it!"
10955,"Amazon",2014-02-18,2,"not what i was expecting To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
10956,"Amazon",2011-08-24,1,"A piece of garbage App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes fifteen seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning interruption point was not savedAll this on our two phones different models so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
10960,"Amazon",2014-10-21,3,"Money Talks, Eh? I think it is great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone. Since it is bundled with Prime Instant Video, I am not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the dollar ninety nine and zero one hundredths that I am being charged. When I want to buy something, I am told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee I live abroad. However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card. do not you think that is a bit hypocritical?"
10963,"Amazon",2015-01-10,1,"I would give it zero starts if I could. AWFUL app It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5. I never could get it to recognize my amazon account, so I could not stream prime music or even retrieve albums I have purchased. It was a huge resource and battery hog too. After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it. Canceled my prime membership too."
10970,"Amazon",2017-06-13,5,"Fantastic little program! Love this player when I am not on a computer. I can listen to music anytime I want with headphone or ear plugs!"
10971,"Amazon",2016-01-27,1,"It is the worst music app yet It is the worst music app yet.the update pop up will not quit.i just deleted the app..it only about money to this website. an you guys need to catch up with eBay on the fees ypu chatge an keep the customers money for twenty one dayz like them.imagine the money from interest ypu collect on other people's money."
10972,"Amazon",2012-08-01,5,"serves all of my music needs I have been using this app for a year on my android phone Verizon droid razr. I uploaded all of the music I own aprox 15gb to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android. I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download. A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me."
10980,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"Amazon Prime Music I am excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. it is early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I am curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I will go with three stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. it is Amazon, I am sure it will be a great product in no time."
10984,"Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Nice, but room to improve Nice idea but still room for improvement. Android app user interface is not as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist does not exist or has eluded my search so far.That said, the audio quality seems fine and it is a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership."
10986,"Amazon",2011-04-26,1,"Not what I expect from Amazon I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can not find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they do not know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I do not want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.Great idea but the app is not ready for prime time."
10988,"Amazon",2013-02-21,3,"it is free, and it works with my cloud music collection While it is pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options it is very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches."

Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to free music with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
11006,"Amazon",2014-10-09,5,"Amazon Rocks. Just want to say Thank You Amazon.Since I love music so much, you made it so easy to listen to them.I love the many choices I have to listen to, not limited to just certain ones.So easy to find and navigate and explore.I even told my family and friends to join up. They sure wont be disappointed at all.Keep up the Good Work.Love Ya Guys."

11024,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Better than Itunes I completely changed from Itunes due to their many restrictions. I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices. So Amazon music is the only place I now purchase from, and it is saved in my account for me to access at all times anywhere."
11026,"Amazon",2017-03-31,5,"Five Stars great gift"
11032,"Amazon",2013-02-13,4,"Amazon MP3 to the rescue There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I have got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who do not use their inside voices on the commuter train."

11047,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"Ejoying The Benefits of Prime!!!! I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash.

Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
11052,"Amazon",2012-11-10,5,"Streaming on Nexus7 I use this app on my Nexus7 and have had no problems. Streams my purchased music and personal uploads to my tablet with no problems."
11053,"Amazon",2014-06-16,4,"Good way to stream music I will admit this is not the best music streaming app, but if you are a prime member, I would say it is a must have.

11055,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"... music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to I listen to a LOT of music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to.

11056,"Amazon",2013-02-18,5,"Fun....... What a fun little AP !!I have it on all of my electronics. SO far no glitches. It was difficult for my tablet to get itself onboard but once it was........... super! It was a tablet issue not the AP issue. TRY IT!!!!"
11058,"Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Not for me, even though free. Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks and albums. Just no way I am gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it is free for Prime members.Going back to Rhapsody."
11061,"Amazon",2014-10-19,2,"Not bad, but could be a lot better. A bit dissapointed with Amazon music, especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members, even if it was all included, it still wouldnt be that good, They are missing a lot of amazing artists, Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
11084,"Amazon",2011-05-09,1,"Update Destroyed Awesome App- Moto Droid two I was using this app a LOT to listen to music but after updating recently, all it says is 'network error' or 'error playing song' on both 3G and WiFi connections. crying I will change to five stars if it gets fixed"
11093,"Amazon",2014-10-23,5,"Great addition to amazon prime Really great collection of music and it is organization only thing that I would change is adding a feature close to Pandoras music mix to give you a saved playlist of music close and varying from the original added song or artist."

11107,"Amazon",2015-01-21,3,"works good Works pretty good. I was a little annoyed that I had to download it from the Amazon app store instead of the Google play store on my one plus one phone. I also would like a little better method of browsing music"
11108,"Amazon",2011-06-07,1,"crashes when playing from cloud drive cant play music stored on cloud drive without crashing. so what is the point of storing your music in the cloud if you cant play it? one star until it is fixed"

I got rid of my spotify to save two dollars a month but I am not sure it was worth it! I think I messed something up signing out? How is that possible with the cloud??My music is just gone from my phone! it is on my computer but I can not even get to my subscription on my phone!!?? I am signed in. I have searched and searched Amazon and Google trying to find answers and Nothing! So disappointed!"
11678,"Amazon",2015-03-22,5,"Five Stars Nice app and Prime Music is a great deal"
11679,"Amazon",2015-01-13,1,"If its not broke, fix it until it is!! I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had meaning songs I did not download from Amazon. I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device why would not they be?, yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I am offline. Even albums I have purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc, yet for some reason the app does not want to play them anymore unless I am connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for offline play if I can only play them when I am online? I do not know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I am not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the eight - ten hours I am at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library does not work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in six months it will probably break again."

11688,"Amazon",2015-04-13,2,"Permission to what? Ok, I do not have alot of experience with these sort off things. But I just got my update notice, and it scared the heck outta me. I had no idea that their permissions allowed them to have as much, if not more, access to do as much as I do on my phone-and other devices. Why do we have to allow them to, set up accts, delete accts, use all our google accts at will, change and delete apps and other data, and on and on... Am I a bit more of a dummy than I thought? Why on earth would they need people to agree to things I would let my own mother have access to? Well, maybe mom... Lol If anyone can help me make sense of this, I could really use the eye opener. But I really can not see myself going for it... Shaking my head..."

11692,"Amazon",2017-03-06,4,"Good except for one issue Pros shocked kay music selection. Had a fair amount of music that I enjoy mostly have metal/death metal added, no other genre-Free with Prime Subscription-Offline listeningCons:-If you want a lot more to choose from, you need an additional subscription-Having lyrics up causes memory issues tons of lag on my device after a short period of timeFinal thoughts: Extended music library should not be something that costs extra. And if you insist on charging extra, mark down the price please. Overall, a nice app that does what it is supposed to."
11694,"Amazon",2016-04-21,1,"What happened, Amazon? Stopped the ability to play DL Prime content without verifying first, which is not the point of offline playback. Offline recordings cached well with a data connection, but like I said in the first sentence this is not the definition of Offline playback.Cleared cache, reinstalled, etc. to no avail. Guess I am paying for Google Play again even though I already have paid for my Prime."
11698,"Amazon",2016-12-30,1,"Worst Music Service I have Ever Seen This service has been atrocious. Only iTunes is worse. Although iTunes can handle more than four0k songs...... I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I am forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can not use it at all. I have uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over four0K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I am supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with four albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can not stand this program."
11699,"Amazon",2016-04-04,3,"Only one small glitch. This app has a fair amount of music. Amazon music unlimited does have a fair amount more, but it is a good selection for a free app with a prime membership. There is a small glitch that causes the app to not play the song you selected at first when you change albums, but when you select it again it works. It has music stations and albums to download. All and all it is worth a download if you have a prime membership. If you do not have a prime membership I would use google play music, because it seems to have less glitches."
11701,"Amazon",2016-10-12,1,"Was an excellent app till a recent update, now it is crash city. Worked fine until recently and now it crashes/stops working 4-5 times a day, slowing down my LG G2 while it does so.

This is a computer for crying out loud. can not you TELL ME what has not already been downloaded? Present me with a list? DOWNLOAD ALL???Drag to a list to download? I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house. My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just does not work AT ALL out in the world. I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO. And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.Sadly, Amazon does not care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.Buying the music is dead simple, and I like to support the artists, and listen to the music I love. Buy getting it to my devices.WOOF, what nightmare!!!"
11704,"Amazon",2014-06-12,1,"it does NOT work on Kindle Amazon.does it AGAIN, tempting us with services they CANNOT provide.If you have some other device, MAYBE it will work.

11714,"Amazon",2014-11-30,1,"Worse than that Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.1. I expended over a dollar one hundred in your store to get a 128GB memory card. I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesn<U+0092>t allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded. I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating. At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, I<U+0092>m in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone. The start the whole process again.2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card. Your app makes them part of the library. Worse than that, I can<U+0092>t delete them all at once or better, just delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone. At times I had deleted over twenty voice mails one by one from the app library. That how stupid it becomes.3. Same as number 2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime. I discover songs that I don<U+0092>t like and I don<U+0092>t know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.4. I can not play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming. When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a Exception number 180 codeIt is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour. That is why you hire software engineers and geeks. Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time."
11716,"Amazon",2016-05-20,1,"Could use some editing I can not move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. it is pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it is a serious space hog and there just is not enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can not be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I will be more than happy to use it."
11718,"Amazon",2017-09-13,1,"Now trash app like others before it. As of the latest 7.1.2 version this stand alone app records audio without permission and no way to turn it off. I have no use at all for this feature . This is not an Alexa, tap, or even a Kindle app, this is on the Android version used on phones. No choice for consumers means no value to consumer. Time to move on and find a better player that let us me choose how I consume my media. Last two updates have had spotty connection. This was last nail in the coffin."
11719,"Amazon",2017-06-08,4,"Amazon Music Use this app almost daily. Love that we can create our own stations to listen to. Totally like there are no commercials to listen to. But there are two complaints I have though. If you put a song in twice by mistake it will not let you delete one of them unless it deletes both from the app. There needs to be a way to just delete a copy. Also when I travel I may be listening to directions and turn it off . As soon as I restart my car starts it comes on / even if I do not turn it on. And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on. There is just a glitch were it comes on without turning it on that could be fixed. But I love the music and so do my grandchildren. We all have our favorite stations. Highly recommend this Amazon App!"
11721,"Amazon",2013-12-07,1,"the latest build broke app used to be a terrific app, but the latest build has made it remarkably useless. i see the new update comes with the ability to share what I am listening to facebook. thanks, but no thanks. i do not need or want people to see what I am listening to. what i want is the old player whose widget worked and that did not lag when playing from the cloud."
11728,"Amazon",2014-01-17,1,"Incapable of storing music on SD card, which is idiotic This app insists on putting all your music on the phone's internal storage. There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.This problem has been known for YEARS. The developers have deliberately ignored it. They simply do not care about how useless this idiotic, pointless restriction makes the app.Amazon is pretty good at a lot of things, but when it comes to this app, it is amateur hour."
11733,"Amazon",2014-09-27,1,"There are better apps out there This app is an absolute mess. If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time. For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app which worked great, this an upgraded version of that app that is just completely missed the mark.I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud. So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those. that is really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.My current issues with this app:- Freezing - This app freezes constantly. I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work. Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.- Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens. it is actually more like I hit it twelve times before I give up. Finally when I accept that I can not skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past twelve songs.- Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works. And it never fails, it always stops working when I am on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.- Playlists that do not shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.- Always have to choose repeat and shuffle. Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with. Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order. The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance. But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast. The only reason I continue to use this app is because I have invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music. I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.If you do not have a huge investment in Prime Music and you are just looking for a music app, definitely look elsewhere.If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review."
11740,"Amazon",2015-09-27,1,"Barely functional This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I have got that done there is no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by say Artist I have got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching is not terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, m there is no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I am moved to a different search tab. This is not rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you are this app is doing is not better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it is laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. there is a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I am forced to use it when say interacting with my Echo."
11743,"Amazon",2014-07-07,1,"Great concept, but essentially unusable in practice! I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the two day shipping and for the last year for streaming video. When the price jumped twenty five percent , the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card purchased via Amazon Prime! installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the increased cost."
11746,"Amazon",2015-09-08,1,"garbage This app is difficult to use and fails often. I have never used an app that made it this difficult to play music. It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it is not user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more."
11747,"Amazon",2013-08-18,1,"No Download Location Setting Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched. Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well. There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."

I am no stranger to downloading music, I have been doing so since the Napster days.Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. it is bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me! . Wrong. it is genuinely terrible.Just today, I purchased twenty or so songs, but in order to retrieve them oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than twenty new songs, I now have two hundred duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space."

I have reinstalled three times. I have uninstalled the update twice. I have refreshed about ten thousand times. Nothing helps.

I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music happened once in a meeting which was not cool. In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it.

The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own. After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again.

11782,"Amazon",2016-11-18,1,"As of this moment, the worst music app in the history of music apps. I used to love this app when it was still an orange icon. The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes. I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes. It was much easier to navigate while driving. The latest update ruined that. It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can not even really use it while I am driving. Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that is a problem.This latest update did not even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it. It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums. So instead of one Christmas album with fourteen songs, in the albums list, you have fourteen albums, each one song in length because of the different artists. Ridiculous!Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs. Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album. No other songs, just the one song. Go figure. what is worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether. For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon five the Animals album along with the lyrics book. Since there is a Prime version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book. I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on. Because it was the prime version, it was not in my normal list of offline albums. So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.The controls are my biggest issue with this new update. What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now fancied up to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums. The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone. Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently. THAT song is still there. Everything else is literally wiped out. I am done. I am going back to iTunes. Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."
11783,"Amazon",2017-08-23,2,"Amazon Prime Music - I use it because it is free and without commercials otherwise I would not bother. I get the Prime version with my prime account for free otherwise I would not use it. The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app Pandora, Slacker, etc. is much better in every way.The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible. My guess is that it is because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they would have to pay the artist and do not want to in a free service. Example: The other apps have a top pop station where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent. Amazon Prime Music - not even close. Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts. I would add say it differently....they are created by experts who are limited by the music available."
11790,"Amazon",2015-12-25,5,"The latest release of the best fifty Beatles hits is terrible because the sound engineers ... I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best fifty Beatles' Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality, but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control. I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I do not understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault. Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV. Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities. I have also revised my star rating accordingly."

Sure, those 3rd parties are not pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that is probably because Amazon does not want to share.Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers. Not only does their weak app store show how they are catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."

For example, if I download My Life from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play Only the Good Die Young even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it is on music from the device only so that is not the issue.

11833,"Amazon",2015-02-28,1,"Why can not I organize my music like other music apps??? This does not meet my expectations. I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not. In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I am looking for. Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck. It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close. If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer. If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck. This app does not let you pull up by composer. Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app. I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title. I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums. Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to. I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books. Why can not this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that does not have a musical background. Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too. However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books. The code would not be that difficult. Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you are good.

There is nothing special about Amazon music unlimited that would make me want to pay an additional dollar seven and ninety nine one hundredths fee to get what used to be included with Prime at no additional charge. As far as the music app, it works okay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control. I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can not add anything else without paying an additional dollar twenty five a year, another Amazon gotcha. They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbook. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks.

Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out ok and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it is losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify. Any searches take 10's of seconds to display anything and then when you click on anything it takes an age to open up, if it bothers at all. This is running on an absolute beast of a PC so the issue is not hardware. Currently this piece of software = WOEFUL."

11845,"Amazon",2017-05-03,1,"Resource hog I have been an Amazon Prime customer for quite some time now. When I open up the Amazon Music app, it uses anywhere from forty percent to one hundred percent of my resources and will lock up my Virtual DJ program and sometimes my entire laptop. This is on a laptop with an i5 processor, 16GB ram and a solid state hard drive and that is all I use it for. I do not have any other programs installed on it. There is absolutely no reason why this program should kill a laptop in order to play or download a song. I have also noticed that not every song you purchase and download from Amazon is set up to be downloaded through the Amazon Music app, some are still coming down as a zip file. There needs to be a standard for downloads and then stick with it. I will stick with Amazon for a little while longer and if it does not improve, I am done with it. There are too many other options to buy or listen to music out there. Come on Amazon, you are far better than this."

I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results.The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can not listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping.The selection is limited.Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes.

I hope amazon does not raise their prices as so far, prime is worth the small increase. I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies. Prime movies, however, has such a small offering I ususally just skip those as I do not want even accidentally trapped into further pricing. We own our own movies, plus have Netflix and Grandma goes to the movies with the grandkids so we are cool with amazon on the movie part. There has been times in the past you could log on to amazon and there was no movies in prime ...so we got used to it. Last month we ordered three complete boxed sets of movies so that will keep us busy."
11865,"Amazon",2014-06-13,2,"Works on Some Devices, Not Others Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in airplane mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded did not show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you have already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for thirty days. Advice: Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."
11867,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Amazon Music Unlimited Review Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available. However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent. The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms. Play queue being an example. The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I am forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked all competitors have this functionality.Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon. Okay is not good enough."
11868,"Amazon",2015-08-10,1,"This app is intrusive, difficult to use and unnecessary. I do not want to stream music but I do want to download digital music I purchased from Amazon. This app did it. It also found every other MP3 file on my computer and added them to this app. I deleted them all from my hard drive and Amazon Music still has them listed among the albums I just purchased and downloaded. I just want to play music in my car from a USB drive. I do not need or want this nonsensical app.After moving the recently purchased albums to a USB drive, Amazon Music decided to download them again. I look at the settings and there is apparently no way to turn this off.This app is going to make me spend hours doing something that could be accomplished in minutes before Amazon forced me to download the app to buy music. As soon as I get my new albums copied from my hard drive, I am going top delete this app and just not buy digital music from Amazon any more."
11873,"Amazon",2012-10-24,4,"My go-to music app! UPDATE: My original review was circa two01two. My how times have changed. The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music. If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA two01two: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps. Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March two01two. Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. two stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
11874,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Great quality and selection, poor sorting and searching tools First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year year is visible once the album has been selected, but I have already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading. This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. it is common for me to view all albums, and it is three indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.I have also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the my recommendations screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list specific example below. Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it is a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it is not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is The Nexus by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that The Nexus is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not."

11895,"Amazon",2015-11-02,4,"Great App; Perhaps More Rare or Obscure Tunes Added to Available Songs I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I have never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."

This app works less well every time ihave to use it. On my thirdvattempt to download my music to new tablet and half the mp3s simply cant download correctly, even though they downloaded just fine to my previous tablet six wks ago.

This is ridiculous! If one purchases Prime for a household, then everyone in the family should have access to the music. Music was a huge reason we purchased Prime. It was a great disappointment when we discovered only one person in our household could access the music. It made our overall opinion of Prime less attractive for our family."

Loading songs is tricky do not like calling a concerto a song, seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references on a Windows computer, and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files.

This thing does not even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time?

Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda... undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind.... then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of downloadable songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you are from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free with pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your aol.com email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device... its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices"

It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation. So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory. it is like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it. They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps. You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card. But it does not always work. It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs. While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure. I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do. So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can not seem to get it right. Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.

11953,"Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"Not bad, unless your device has small built-in storage, or you have poor data connection. UPDATE:I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this is not a bad thing. But the problem is when you do not have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can not do anything but force close it.Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.___________I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. it is actually not a bad app, even if you do not have Prime or do not purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that is already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it is much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.I will also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. it is really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we would have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."

Obviously there is a phone home check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!Otherwise, it is an ok app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway"

Joined Prime Music this year, took a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today. Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy. Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law. Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library. What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format. Odd, they play on everything else I own. Most likely a licensing or royalty issue. Not at all happy now. I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit was not uploaded, do not own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them. I do not like surprises, do not think anyone does."
11995,"Amazon",2012-12-13,5,"Great MP3 music player I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily. It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player. Easy interface to use and browse your music.My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there is not one on the original album. I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence! and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause. Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well. Try listening to Wagner: The Ring Without Words and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts. I would give this a five star rating if they would fix that problem.UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review. Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other. I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."

Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second hit the home key or switch tasks I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I many times have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a five star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now especially for Amazon, who does not have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song and there are so many competitors Google Play Music, for instance I can not justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs which took almost a day! then deleted. you have lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."

12021,"Amazon",2016-11-13,1,"Pitiful Really. I am fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I am talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this does not happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages a couple of screens long.This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really does not want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I do not want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that."

I do like the fact that I can choose between my personal library and the Amazon Prime library. The only thing I wish were different is the fact that there are some songs and artists I can absolutely not find. This is probably due to song/album/artist rights and more of an artists choice than an Amazon issue, but it is still a bummer."

I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, and it did not even load all of my music back into the cloud, including Prime music I would added to playlists.I had hoped the app would let me listen to the tons of music I have purchased from Amazon, and for it to be a friendlier alternative to iTunes, which I dislike on principle. It is entirely frustrating when I can not listen smoothly even at home, with strong wifi, on Amazon's own devices and apps. I hope it gets updated soon, because this is unacceptable."

Also, I used to enjoy being able to swipe my finger from right to left to go to the next song, but you have ruined that too by causing a dialog box to come up every time you touch the album art. I have cancelled my yearly cloud subscription and will be looking elsewhere to enjoy my music. you have destroyed a perfectly good app in what appears to be an attempt to make more money.

In my case, my 8GB phone Moto G LTE will run out of space quite quickly.Athough my android Android 4.4.3 KitKat shows the move app option, it does not work!I am seriously looking into a different ecosystem which has an app that allows me to store music on the external micro SD 32 GB.

If there was a way to upload more legally purchased music to the cloud for playback, I would be sold. This aspect of personal music storage is a huge selling point for Amazon Prime Music versus online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have. What I would love to see is a way to sync or play music from the cloud that I have purchased elsewhere either via cd or digitally.

How does an app this small use one hundred fifty eight and four tenths percent of a 4K video rendering monster. How, just, uh...It just blows my mind that Amazon has produced such an epic P.O.S. Seriously, I can not imagine a company that sells music, failing in such epic proportion at producing a decent piece of software to manage and play music. How awful is the Amazon Fire? The Kindle? Echo? I do not know, why would I ever buy hardware from a company that can not write software to manage their own content. You should not either. We, the consumers need to start making our collective voices heard by not buying into the failed ideas and policies of corporations based solely on greed and if complacency is to be considered, perhaps even sloth."

Now since the update, it apparently will not read from the SD card my other players still do, so I know they are there and there is no way to direct it to look in specific locations.I will not upload my entire collection to stream as that would be a waste of data and the limitations on Amazon MP3 make that a non-option anyway.

Lately, songs purchased through the app appear in the app as on the device but not when using the Android Music Player.

Why is it so? Because when trying to create playlists, I can not read an entire id tag because it is too long.

From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc. I previously used Pandora and I <U+00A2><U+00BE> Radio. Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better! I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping. It was well worth it. As a whim, I decided to try the music app. I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love! I was quickly creating my own playlist. I have created quite a library with so many different types of music. I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone. I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy. I find all of the process easy. The only warning is some songs that are free are rerecorded so watch for that and play samples before purchasing. Those songs are the minority, but can happen. If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library. It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews. I haven't shared their experiences at all. Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc. I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app! I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim. Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music. I simply search for artist and songs. Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love. I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also. I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free. So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices. This is a great gift in itself. I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."
12162,"Amazon",2014-07-21,1,"Eats data like it tastes good. I have been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years. I have generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I am not super tech savvy. My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it is a pain in the rear apparently my files could not be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album would not. My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I would have to re-learn where everything was again. But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to four.0.four.Which has sucked. I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed. I have found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason. I am not a big data consumer. My average data use over the past year or so does not usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month. I am on Wi-Fi more often than not at home and at work, so I am usually only streaming 3g/fourg in the car. Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I am close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over seven hundred mb of data.In four days.When I am not using the app, I close it. It restarts itself. I close it again. It restarts again. And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off. Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I have never had before, and I am not just disappointed with the app. I am pretty well disgusted with it. If I am in my car, I can not fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it is still buffering. It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I have now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi. Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I have used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I will not likely abandon it right off the bat. I will take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library again, and move on. In the meantime, I am peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app will not just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I have previously enjoyed and recommended to others. That will not be happening again."

If you like to listen to different music genres and do not want to pay a bunch of money to have it then give Prime music a try."
12201,"Amazon",2015-09-05,3,"Needs a few simple but vital improvements I like the fact that I get to listen to music comercial free with my Prime Membership but the app needs a few vital improvements to get a five star rating. 1. When clicking thumbs down, I wish it gave the option to permanently exclude the artist from my station. I do not like Nickleback and I keep pressing thumbs down only to have another Nickleback song play later on. 2. When creating Playlists, I wish it the had the capability of slecting songs from your cloud library AND your offline library for the same playlist. 3. My favorite station never stays up top and sometimes I have to search for the station I was listening to an hour ago. Can we favorite stations and create a list? 4. When listening to stations, I often will hear the same songs over and over within an hour or two but yet songs I hit the tumbs up for could take days until I hear them again. that is just baffling!"
12202,"Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"quite buggy I was looking for a cloud/PC app that would allow me to ditch GooglePlay's music app on my PC and android phone Samsung Note3 is what I presently have. GooglePlay will allow you to upload your entire library from your PC, either iTunes, Windows Media player, etc. Its pretty good, all the songs uploaded and you can create playlists and download those playlists to whatever device you are using.Amazon's does that, pretty much. However, not all songs uploaded. I tried rescanning and rescanning, and ever time it finds a few more songs to upload. One album of mine in particular it absolutely refuses to upload. Nothing is wrong with the format, or any of the locations I tried moving the songs to in order to try an upload... just tells me there is not anything new in the folders to upload. And no, they are not in the amazon library at all with me just missing them. I checked the entire darn thing.Also, it uploaded quite a few songs multiple times. Some songs will not play all the way through. I can not seem to find a way to move an entire playlist to my device instead of just streaming the music using my data that I am limited on. Since I do not have a wifi connection at work, this is pretty much useless for me.I like that I can use amazon prime music and get a lot of songs free, but since I can not get the app to work on my computer anyway tried many times, and I am tech savvy enough to be able to do that kind of thing Amazon music is not for me just yet. Amazon, I hope you can fix these items, you are so close! happy"

I have also noticed, the sound quality on Amazon music is way better and louder then when I listen in the Apple app. The bottom line: Ditching Apple iTunes like a bad habit, switching everything over to Amazon, and I may even add a cloud subscription so I can upload all of the stuff I have purchased from iTunes over the year to have it in one place. Please, please, keep it good and continue adding more music, and do not feel the need to copy Apple. Apple let its success got to its head and is on the decline, this is a breath of fresh air."

On the bright side I have been able to listen to a wider selection of artists, I love listening to all these Broadway soundtracks too. Just a great overall app."
12222,"Amazon",2011-09-15,3,"Frustrating because promising This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone an Atrix. I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers though the tagging and Unknown Artist issues still pose problems, and I love the browser interface. However, the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality. If it worked as it is supposed to it would be spectacular, offering the capability to buy a song from the store, then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly. It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up at least while you can stream it over wifi. In practice, though, it just does not offer the experience it promises. It force closes about sixty percent of the time I try to use it. When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly and usually then force closes. Music playback often skips. This last issue may be android's fault, as I have noticed it in other players, though never so badly as in the amazon one. However, I do not experience the other problems in different music players. Until Amazon fixes these issues, this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application. it is an exciting idea, and the interface would be excellent if it just worked."

I have emailed to request a complete refund, and will up the rating once this occurs.Note: I attempted to verify the bitrates on the album pages, but I was directed to AmazonMP3's app, which did not offer any product details.I realize that I am being very OCD here, but as a huge fan of both Amazon and the Archeophone Archives products, as a consumer, I want the best quality possible. Give me that at a good price, and I am very happy to spend all my fun money here happy ===I bought four mp3 albums for the first time over the past few days, featuring acoustic-era phonograph music. Given my past experience with Amazon, I was greatly dissatisfied upon listening to the albums because they are 256kbps and I was expecting, if not lossless FLAC, then at least full-320kbps.It may not be much of a difference, but as a fan of this music, I am VERY disappointed on principle alone and would love a refund of these four dollar eight and ninety nine one hundredths albums.

Now it locks up or it just does not play music at all -- it attempts to play, but then skips to the next song. Real frustrating. I am satisfied with the music selection -- I do not expect to have everything, so that is ok. Love the playlists and the flexibility of arranging them on my PC. But Amazon really needs to work on this cloud issue.

This app is, instead, what you run on an Android phone/tablet. With that being said:This app is crap. it is entire focus is to get you to BUY music, rather than stream music from your Amazon Cloud Drive. The app is incredibly commercial-centric. From the moment you start it up you are given two choices/buttons: Cloud Drive Music or Store. Each time you boot it up, you get the same two stupid buttons: Cloud Drive or Store. The Store is ever present, regardless of where you may be within the app. what is more, the app continuously crashes hangs on my multiple devices: LG Optimus Slider, Motorola Triumph, and XOOM tablet. Regardless of whether you are using Froyo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, etc. EXPECT crashes and hangs.

Now instead of trusting that the entire album has been downloaded I need to double check. It is not my network connection nor the network. I run in to these problems at home, work, even when running 4G as the only wireless connection. I now have a note three and these same problems persist. Not impressed at all.There are other issues with the app such as when the red exclamation indicating a download error icon appears on the Song line. Quickly touching this icon should take you to a pop up screen asking if you want to retry or cancel the download. Half of the time when I hit that button the player opens and tries to play the song.

I paid for the larger storage capacity, but so far I have not been able to upload even the amount I am allowed for free. The uploader constantly crashes. Then you have to restart and deal with all the duplicates from the first attempt. If I can not get my thousands of tracks uploaded, this will be of little use to me. The only reason I bought the space in the cloud was so that my new Amazon Echo which works MUCH better could access most of my music collection. If I can not get the collection into the library in the first place, what is the point?"

You should really start paying attention to users."

I have been using a lot of the music streaming services but this particular service from Amazon I like much better because of several factors:1- The amazon prime subscription allows me to listen to unlimited music of my liking and get awesome deals at amazon!2- The stream quality is great, no pauses or lags3- The service is basic and easy to use and has a wide selection of music, playlists and features to suit any needs!"

It took me a while to search and find that Amazon has changed/upgraded the app and changed its name. Thought about downloading the new version....but would it overwrite all of my existing playlists? LOTS of those to lose. Also there were references to fees and charges for the new version of the player. Called customer service and of course got transferred around before getting the information I need.What an unnecessary waste of time. Instead of sending me an email before the switch, touting the latest features and more selling opportunities for Amazon, they made me mad, wasted their customer service agents' time, and BTW, I STILL do not know what the new features are.Useful to know: you cannot export a playlist from this player, or even print one for reference."

And now, uploading music requires an awkward manual process. Also I agree with another reviewers who says the app is intrusive.

I started listening to it being diligent to rate the music I like vs the stuff I do not like, then all of a sudden I start hearing artists like Justin Timberlake, Avril Lavigne and Jason Mraz. WTF Amazon. Do you guys not know when the 80's were? How hard is it to write code that tells the station, if the song was not released between one thousand nine hundred eighty and one thousand nine hundred eighty nine then it is not 80's music....Your stations suck, and I am going back to the free Pandora.

For some reason this app only lets you download music to your internal memory.What does that mean you ask? Well, Android users have this awesome feature where you can add memory to your phone using a micro SD card. Usually we add these for apps like Amazon Music because music and video can take up a lot of memory. Especially if you are a music lover. For some reason this app does not allow you to save music to you SD memory, just your internal, which is usually only sixteen gigs or so.If your device has a lot of internal memory then by all means go crazy with this app, it is pretty awesome. But if you have not that much internal memory to spare THEN AVOID THIS APP! IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORY LIKE THE KLUMP'S AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT!Until they fix it then I will change my rating."

12417,"Amazon",2011-08-24,5,"Best of the Best I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app. I have been hooked since. I have an approximately six GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected. While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid. Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer. All of this for the same price and often cheaper as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service. I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the two GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. do not get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors. However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says Free for a limited time ... makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great or if you do not have a unlimited data plan."
12418,"Amazon",2016-10-06,5,"This works! I like it, especially as an alternative to itunes.It took me a while but I finally migrated all my apple music over.Now I can listen to my cloud library or prime music in the car with very little data usage."

12439,"Amazon",2012-04-25,2,"I want to like it... but I have to say the program on my Droid two is sluggish and locks up occasionally. Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly. Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that will not drain your phone battery and stay charged for much longer. I do not see the point? You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists: Welcome back to one thousand nine hundred eighty nine when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud instead of making a mix CD or tape. No automatic playlists based on a song you like. You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist. I use Itunes and MediaMonkey with some apps installed to help create auto playlists. Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud. What a hassle. There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists. Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator on the browser-based cloud player. I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums.... I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library. I do not know if it is even possible.Uploading songs: Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud. Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists. There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I do not miss anything. And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything. it is a chore and takes a long time. Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres: I am a nut about tagging my music. I will tag my music separating the tag with a ; for each tag. Amazon does not recognize this and now I have seven hundred thirty six different Genres. Useless.Pluses: You can buy music on Amazon and it is there ready to stream on the app immediately. If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything and I mean a lot in my music library."

This throttling should be set to two devices at an absolute minimum to support the typical family. We have four kids and do things separately all the time. We do not want to clog up our phones by downloading the songs every time we want to listen to them, so we the use of the CLOUD. We also use Amazon for all of our Movie storage, via Rokus. The whole idea of having an App and the cloud is to PREVENT this downloading business.

Maybe one or two of my playlists will appear in the Recent Playlists section.. and that seems iffy at best.Also, even when the lists appear... it seems that AM is pulling the music from online, not the downloaded music I have. This is annoying as hell as i get skips, etc that there should be no reason for.The recommended stuff lists are of no use to me... but there is no way to kill it.I think once my free preview of the service is done... I am letting it go."

When I am below my limit streaming is good however, when Metro starts to throttle my band width because I have exceeded my limit, streaming is intermittentnot usable. However, during these low band width condition, Pandora still streams extremely well, seems that Amazon could fix this!As a work around I decided to store locally, however I noticed that YOU CANT store on your external sdcard. At this point I have stopped purchasing from Amazon MP3. I would love it, if they could fix the external storage problem. Since you are forced to store on your phone's internal flash memory, you quickly start having issues with system performance ie no space for mail..and so forth.Great product if you have unlimited 4G.

Sadly, now that you have changed it I will be looking for a different player."

12523,"Amazon",2015-02-02,5,"Music, music, everywhere! I am really thrilled with Amazon Music. I started with the app for PC so I could enjoy my Amazon Prime Music benefits on my computer, but then added Amazon Music to my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire. I am really sold on this, and here's why:Being a Prime member, I can add a wide variety of music to my cloud storage for free, which is exactly what I did. Hundreds of songs - FREE! Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I have purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I have purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I have not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I am not sure it is possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use. To be honest, I thought it was really straightforward and easy to use. One complaint that I saw says you can not use your newly-purchased music unless you download everything again... I bought some new music yesterday and I downloaded just the new music. It was very simple to figure out and download. Perhaps the complainers had an older version of the app?If you are a Prime member and love music, I think you will like this app. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
12524,"Amazon",2015-09-08,5,"Love prime music Love prime music, have it on every device and it works wonderfully. Ironically, I can not get on in my kindle, so I will probably buy a regular android tablet next so I can actually use this app on my tablet instead of having to use phone or computer."

But not from the APP!!!I am at a complete loss as to what is going on.I have tried COPY / PASTE, Manual typing and it always comes back with Wrong USERNAME or PASSWORD .

There is no 'playlist' file that can be transferred or updated to find the newly relocated music. Now you just have a playlist on your phone that has '0' songs in it.Storage location is a must for this type of app."

The complication arose out of my cross platform use. I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go. If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store. I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device. The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3. I highly recommend Amazon's Solution."
12548,"Amazon",2011-09-23,3,"Eh. It has promise. Love the idea. I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is cool , but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:1 Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I am playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity is not an issue.2 Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I have seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very tinny sounding. it is not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.3 Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. Random should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.4 Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere."

VERY STUPID and QUITE LIKE THE TAIL END OF A DONKEY, is my answer.Then, when you move the files, if they are sunc from the cloud, it wants to start putting them back and pretty soon the phones are crashing again for lack of internal memory. Bite us!"

Will be canceling my music unlimited subscription."
12574,"Amazon",2011-12-09,3,"Does not display embedded Post Cast info I am assuming this is the same music player built into the Kindle Fire. I am looking for a mp3 player which will display Podcast Info and subtitles embedded within mp3 files as the audio is played. This is not state it does in the descriptions nor was it able to. So I am giving the neutral ratting of 3. However, the cloud storage works great! I will upgrade to five stars should this app be updated to do this. You are welcome to leave a comment to my review should you know of on which does this.Background info of what I am looking for:My Chinese lessons mp3 files have Chinese phonetic, English translation, and Chinese characters along with the audio. This makes them very useful to learn the foreign language. The size of my Kindle Fire is perfect for studding my lessons. However, the KF MP3 player and this app does not do this.To enable this feature for Windows Media Player, to the following:Right click screen on WMP, mouse over pop up menu Lyrics captions subtitles , click On if available To enable this feature on an iPod Touch MP3 player may be the same for iPhone and iPad, do the following:Settings->Music->Lyrics and Podcast Info - ON"
12575,"Amazon",2014-11-21,1,"Slow and Incompatible with Android five and zero tenths The app is extremely slow to start up. It took approximately one minute to get to the login screen, then it took about another thirty seconds to log me in. Unfortunately, that was ninety useless seconds as the app crashes after that. It looks like the app has not been updated for Android five and zero tenths. If the compatibility issue is ever fixed, maybe I will give this another try, but until then, this should not be downloaded by anyone on Lollipop."

The app does not show up anywhere at all, except in the app manager as running where I would have to forcibly stop it. it is easier to reboot my phone. I think I am done with this app.Samsung phone."

12580,"Amazon",2013-04-10,4,"Not compatible sad I was sad to see that my new tablet was NOT compatible with Amazon MP3. I have Amazon Mobile and Amazon Appstore on it so I thought MP3 would be no problem and...well...it is not even in the appstore for me to get and when I tried from the site,it said it was not compatible. I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download itpurchase it with credit and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. four stars all the way,would have given it five if it was compatible with my tablet.

12598,"Amazon",2016-12-13,3,"will not play most of the time Most of the time it will not play, just says it is loading. that is more like some free service. But since I am paying for Prime this should load and play like a paying streaming service."
12602,"Amazon",2015-05-05,1,"Purposfully Confusing. The only rational explanation I can find for Prime Music being so ridiculously messed up is that Amazon is trying to confuse their users and have them spend money that they would not otherwise. I could not find a way to see tracks which are included with Prime, and stay within Prime. They would insert one or two paid tracks in the search results. The UI is so clumsy and confused, I could not make sense of it. I am software engineer, and have seen many pieces of software - some good, some dab, and some downright ugly. This one is ugly."

12609,"Amazon",2015-07-14,4,"I like it. I think Amazon Music is great as it is included with Prime Membership. There are so many free songs you can download, especially the old rock classics. I do find the format difficult to navigate which gets frustrating. I wish you could download to the cloud and your device at the same time. I hate having to download the song to the cloud and then download it to my device also. Especially if I am downloading lots of songs. It takes sooooo long. Once, all of my songs disappeared from my Kindle and I had to download all of them again. Not fun. Since it is included with my Prime membership, I really can not complain too much."

12623,"Amazon",2016-07-25,5,"Tons of free music I love this app! I have access to a ton of music and can play it on my phone, TV, and connect to bluetooth in my car. I pretty much only listen to Amazon Prime Music. The radio has too much talking and commercials and they play the same songs over and over. I can pull songs from my library or theirs and play what I want to hear. It was a huge incentive to renew my membership."
12626,"Amazon",2017-02-11,1,"The latest version absolutely sucks Takes forever to load sometimes as long as twenty minutes. While loading will send CPU to one hundred percent capacity and then when it does it does not show the music you just requested to be downloaded after purchase.

I have nothing negative to say, and wish I made a profit off of the amount of people I make download this app!!! Prime is worth every penny even just for this app. Love that I can choose songs to listen to, add them to my library.. Tremendous amount of choices. So impressed."
12628,"Amazon",2014-07-22,5,"I will NEVER use iTunes again! It took me about one week to figure out all the the INs-and-OUTs of the app on my iphone. All I can say is that I will not EVER use iTunes again. I have a total love affair with my iPad and iPhone, but I have never had any great love lost for iTunes. Now with this really great application, I will not ever worry about it again...ever.First of all--if for nothing else--there are more than a million songs available on Prime Music. You have to do nothing more than choose the music you want to listen to then download it to your device even prime music can be downloaded to a tablet or smart phone. When it has been downloaded to your tablet or smart phone, then you can listen without streaming. Hours and hours of music, and a whole host of it for free! There are also pre-created playlists that Amazon suggests, and you can add this playlist with a simple click, touch, or swipe of the finger!Then any music you have purchased in just about forever is available on your Amazon cloud. The trick to getting pre-existing music from the cloud to show up on your device is to add a playlist in your cloud which I just titled all my music and then select your music to add to a playlist. Then once it is in a playlist, you can download all your music at once with the download arrow on your device.Also, if you have uploaded music to your Amazon cloud, that music is there, too!After you have downloaded music, if you do not want it, then you swipe the song to the left, and it gives you the option to delete. The same left-swipe option allows you to download single songs-instead all your songs-from the cloud.This application works FLAWLESSLY on my iPhone. A coworker has an android smartphone, and it works flawlessly on hers, too.This is now my go-to app for all my music. I do not use iTunes at all. I can find ALL my music. I also like the various ways I can look at music, either in a list or individually. I can mix so that I am playing tunes in random order instead of hearing the same list over and over again. I can listen to my entire Amazon music library on the computer, through my tablet or phone, just practically anywhere.This app is IT for me. Thanks, Amazon! Job well done...again and again and again.One more thing: if you are having trouble making the app work for you, then try Amazon's help link for the Amazon Prime Music App. Go to Prime Music in Amazon, and keep clicking on links that say Learn more about Prime Music until you get to the Amazon Help. There, you will find a three-minute video about Amazon Prime Music. Also there are additional links in the left-hand column if you are on your PC that will benefit you, too.Happy listening!!"
12631,"Amazon",2015-03-27,1,"Too Much..... I appreciate Amazon trying to get into the internet radio scene, but I would want the option between this and my plain Amazon app that just gives me access to my own bought music. I hope someone on Amazon payroll reads this."

My family and I were in the car driving home from the grandparents, and we started talking about a play we recently saw Joseph and the amazing technicolor dream coat and enjoyed it so much that we wanted to listen to the music again and sing along. I know I have the cd at home, but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there, and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home and kept the driver awake in the process, which was great. It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly. Very happy and made me appreciate the service all the much more already love prime for the free two day shipping and use it all the time. I would recommend it to anyone who would like tons of music at their fingertips without a monthly fee."

12672,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"Amazon Molasses is more like it on Android As a prime member who has bought countless albums and songs from amazon, this app is now beyond useless for streaming. Every time I open it my list of music is empty. The service spends at least half an hour loading my cloud songs every time I open it, and that is even with a strong Wifi signal. Songs are still loaded to my phone's memory instead of the SD card, so downloading the stuff directly to my phone is a nightmare. The only way I can listen to my music is to download it from the site on my pc, then install it on my memory card and use the player, or another one, to listen to the songs. I do not know who is behind the development of the app. But if I were Jeff Bezos, then I would put it into the hands of someone else. There is no reason that my entire playlist needs to be downloaded every single time I open the app. There is no reason that I should be denied the option of saving to the card instead of the phone."

12683,"Amazon",2013-01-25,1,"SD Card disabling killed this app This app was great at one time. I was able to download all mp3 files directly from amazon to a micro sd card. For some absolute unkown reason they have disabled that function altogether. The limited internal storage of the phone coupled with the brutal data allowances of verizon handcuff the use of this app at all.I loved having quick and easy access to my mp3 files from virtually anywhere, but now find this app almost useless. Even went as far as uninstalling the app updates to strip it back down to the original version; which actually allowed the files to be saved directly to the sd card, but found that amazon has completely shut down the ability to sign in.In short....a year ago or less this app was a 5-star. Today it is less than zero."

Ergo I no longer use this app. I just listen to Pandora or Jazz Radio instead.Second, it is a nice idea to add extra free music for Prime members, but for anyone that listens to something other than current pop rock it is pretty useless.

There is a limitation to the Android operation system that does not allow widgets if it is on your SD card. After doing this I was able to use the widget once again.

12816,"Amazon",2013-04-13,1,"The Amazon MP3 app and music ecosystem is terrible. Does Amazon understand digital goods? The Amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word, horrific . Skip this app, save time, save the dollar twenty four and ninety nine one hundredths annual fee, and use Google Music instead. Google Music is a competing cloud service free for up to twenty five thousand songs, and it just works. it is available from the Google Play storeThe Amazon MP3 app is buggy, clunky, looks dated and does not even offer genres for browsing through your library! Bluetooth cuts out frequently when I listen to songs through the app on my tablet. The app design says two thousand nine and it eschews the Android Holo design language for Amazon's awkward Kindle theme. The app starts you off on a screen where you have to select Store or Player , and it does not seem to remember your preference, so you need to select Player each time you restart the app. That adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen, which disrupts your listening experience. The app does not support genre browsing. You simply cannot use your music catalogue's genres. do not bother with the Amazon MP3 app or Amazon's music ecosystem if you do any of the following: 1 purchase digital music 2 consume digital music 3 manage your music library 4 value your sensibilities as a consumer of music.The cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly Web based. You must supplement the Web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions. The desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad. Purchase songs and they are saved to the cloud and made available for free through Amazon Cloud Player. An ok start. Album art is 500px by 500px, also great.The rest of the Amazon MP3 experience is problematic. Album art from purchased songs is massive. A 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous. Metadata is messy. Artists are not tagged correctly and Amazon makes no distinction between the Album Artist vs Artist metadata fields. Album titles have random words capitalized. Songs are inconsistently labeled. I need to re-tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer. So much for the phone app. Oh wait, you need to install a desktop app to download multiple MP3s, and you also need Adobe Air. And you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs. You also can not push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud you need to make a list of each updated song, sign in to cloud player, delete each song, one by one from the cloud, then select each song from your desktop, and upload each song to the cloud. if you thought you could simply delete an album from the cloud and re-upload it, you are wrong..Google Music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience, is well integrated into Android, supports Genres and follows Android's design language. Google Music does this right. twenty five thousand songs uploaded to the cloud for free. Song management is almost perfect.The Google Music app starts up in the tab you last visited, so if you were in albums or artists, it picks up where you left off. You can purchase music, but consuming it is the heart of the app. Amazon's MP3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app's users go to it to listen rather than shop for music. Songs I purchase from Google Play have tagged file metadata correctly nice, Google!. Album art is perfect, Web optimized at 512px by 512px close enough for me. The app has genre filtering and browsing. It allows you to randomize songs within a genre. The cover flow is very spiffy. I have invested time in getting my album art consistent so I could browse music visually as well as through metadata. I can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app. The app uses the latest Android Holo design language, so looks consistent with the rest of the Android apps. It functions great and has a lock screen widget.Pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on Google Music, but nothing like the eighty steps per album Amazon experience. You can delete an album with two clicks. After that, it is six step process you complete once per batch of updates, whether it is an album or one hundred albums. The cloud service is truly cloud based, and the user interface is elegant and intuitive. Like Amazon MP3, you need desktop software to upload music. Unlike Amazon MP3, in Google Play you can effortlessly download an entire album, delete it, or edit its metadata from the cloud, without the need for additional desktop software.The Amazon MP3 app is the opposite of Google Music. Go to Google Play, search for Google Music, and get started with an amazing music listening experience."

13036,"Amazon",2011-04-04,3,"BIG fan of the idea, but it needs some reworking/rethought - MY SUGGESTIONS I love the concept of a cloud drive, especially from my preferred vendor of MP3s, however the player/store needs a reworking. There are some performance issues which I am sure they are working on since this is the initial launch, however my real gripes are with their overall approach to playing music from a their own remote source.Why must shopping/playing from cloud/playing locally feel like three completely separate tasks in one app? Instead of trying to jam two apps into one, and still giving the user that segregated feeling, give this app some synergy! I know that is pretty lame buzzword, but listen...The concept is simple at the high level:The user's list of tracks should be unification of what is online only, and what they have locally... NOT two separate lists. I would like to see indicators of a track's source, but I should be able to make a playlist or at least a track selection that pulls from BOTH sources. This would actually save their bandwidth to pull from local storage whenever possible. Keep the ability to switch to offline mode, but it should not be the default, and it should NOT feel like a separate app/task/list. Much better user experience.On top of that, Amazon could sell much more music through the player by giving us the ability to sample music similar to our own library, or what we just listened to. they have got their similar customers logic down pretty good, why not put it right in the player? do not force it on us, but offer it. As much flack as Apple gets for it is Genius lists, that stuff sells a lot of music. I would think this would be easy for Amazon.My last suggestion may be a pipe dream but for Android two and two tenths users, Amazon really should tie into the Voice Actions events. When I say Listen to Tool or better yet, music I do not have to my phone, the only apps on my phone that support that action are Pandora and Last.fm... Why not Amazon? If it is something I have, play it! If not, give me samples with the ability to quickly purchase. I think that could be a HUGE driver of sales.THINK ABOUT IT DEVELOPERS, THINK ABOUT IT!Lastly, as many other reviewers have said, app functionality dedicated solely to browsing for mp3's should be separate... or built into one of your other shopping apps, not into the player. I know you think that is gonna help sell music, but now I have to click extra times to get to the market because I normally use this app as a player, so I normally just wait till I am at a computer, and sometimes I forget what I wanted to look for. Not an optimal experience for the user or the salesman!"

The only critiques I have are that the app needs to include a Current list of top fifty for each category, in addition to aggregating compilation albums so they are listed as a single album after downloading instead of around fifteen separate albums. Makes it kind of annoying when I want to listen to a soundtrack, and have to create a playlist to do so because the songs are not grouped together under one album."

I almost do not want to buy music from Amazon anymore."
13107,"Amazon",2012-07-16,2,"Decent, but consumes too much internal storage I have used the MP3 app since it was released. I now have about ninety percent of my music collection in Amazon Cloud. The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card. Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage."

Might be the greatest app in the history of the world - but I will never know, since it will not play my Cloud-stored purchases from Amazon and will not update. It just continually tells me there is an update - which is at least one version back, it is saying 2.0.4 - but refuses to either open or update. It just stays locked on Starting download , without ACTUALLY downloading. So I can not play the music I just bought. Amazon, sometimes you really SUCK."

I buy all of my music on Amazon and I like how my music is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere. I use the Cloud Player to listen to music on my work computer. I also like that I can choose what to download to my phone. This app desperately needs the ability to change the download location. I have a Droid Razr Maxx and on some newer Android devices sdcard/ refers to internal memory and sdcard-ext/ refers to the addon SD card. AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard-ext/. I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to, but this app has no option to do that. Instead it downloads to the internal memory. Amazon really needs to add the ability to change the download location of the music. This one flaw mars an otherwise great app."

13516,"Amazon",2011-04-30,4,"Amazon Bring back free music song of the day on the opening menu.

13538,"Amazon",2013-01-19,2,"Bug in Amazon MP3 App for Android I was shocked to see that one click ordering is automatically activated even if it is turned OFF in your account settings. Please look into this bug. I discovered this when purchasing an MP3 album. Sometimes a customer needs to select a particular billing account - credit card, and address, then verify they are correct."
13545,"Amazon",2011-09-19,5,"works great on lg lx2 the app works as it should. although I wish it would allow changing default storage locations. however the music selection and the fact that music cost less than competitive services make up for.any shortcomings."

13735,"Amazon",2017-08-14,5,"Five Stars awesome!"
13736,"Amazon",2011-03-30,1,"A clunky, clumsy mess. Listener interface and functionality are primitive at best. If you are just into uploading mass quantities of stuff and cramming it in the attic for safekeeping I guess it is okay, if pricey, but if you are hoping to actually use this thing to listen to music and customize your listening experirence, wait for something hopefully much, much better."

Once I get all my music on the cloud drive I will probably use this more than my iPod."
13783,"Amazon",2011-06-02,1,"Forced to have this program This program came instalked by default on my evo 4g with no way to remove it. At least give us a way to remove it so the people who do not want it can take it off. What is the point in not giving us a remove option?"

13792,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-11,3,"Good but Frequently Malfunctions This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."

13804,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-14,3,"Not impressed. Not a real big fan of this app. If I want commercials I can listen to the radio in my car. The way everyone talked about it, I had to try it. Maybe I just haven't found the right radio stations"

I think that the application was great at first but then it started freezing.When ever I go on it and try to change the music,it says that it is not responding and to wait or close it!

13815,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-03,5,"One of my daily use apps! I use this app on a daily basis for radio at home. I live in an area that has poor radio reception on all radios in my home. No problems in my vehicles but reception sucks in the house. This app allows me to have a huge variety of stations from the internet via Wi-Fi. The clarity of the music stream is awesome and it is highly customizable with favorites. I really like this app and recommend it"

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ~ five *'S..."
13826,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-30,4,"Generally good music I enjoy the app, but just wish it contained more episodes of Casey Kasem's American Top forty countdown. Also, some of the classics stations pop, country, rock, soul, etc. do not actually contain music from the genre they are supposed to, which can be an annoyance."
13828,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,2,"No way to stop the music This is a good App,but I have two mayor complaints:first,I selected some type of music and selected one broadcasting of the same one,and it never sound.It looks like non existent,so this is something very annoing;second,once you are done hearing the music there is no way to turn off the site,you have to turn off the ,in my case,the kindle Fire.Also,wrong.Usually I try to hear music at the same time I am reading,so I have to turno off the whole sistem,not just the App."
13830,"iHeartRadio",2014-11-07,4,"Can listen to my favorite morning show I started using the iHeartRadio app when I could not listen to the radio at my new job.

13832,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-19,5,"AMAZING! I used to use this app all the time. My brother constantly insisted on me switching to Pandora, but I loved listening to the radio anywhere.

I have been using it for years and will continue. it is had been glitch free. My favorite option is building my own stations. I would definitely recommend"
13848,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-28,2,"I suppose But I prefer to just listen to music files locally as I do not like listening to hit music. I use it for streaming news and sports on the go though. iHeartRadio app also does not offer every station available in your area. Just the ones that are licensed by ClearChannel."
13851,"iHeartRadio",2012-05-09,2,"will not connect with Facebook it is funny how the Amazon version of this app won' t connect using Facebook, but the Google Play version will.This is not the first time I have seen differences in the offerings of the two app stores. Unfortunately, it tends to be Amazon that falls short of the mark. For those of you with Kindle Fire that might be interested in Google Play apps, I would suggest finding out how to sideload the apps. it is not difficult, and it gives you another - and sometimes better - app source."

13858,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-10,5,"great app!! I love this app honestly. it is a great alarm. And sleep timer. Also the music is amazing. I am in a different state, and now I can listen to my music from back home. But I think they should add a extra thing to where we can make a playlist of songs and be able to go to that sometimes. But I hope you take this to heart. Rate five for sure."

When I found this app, I was shocked to see the ticket on there. Now I listen to it every morning and even got some of my friends hooked on it."
13885,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-28,4,"iHeart User Not Ideal I do not use this feature. It is difficult to depend on. Most technical minded people will be better than I am at this, I am sure."
13887,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-02,3,"All it does is crash three stars. Not because I can review it, but because all it does is crash. Since i will not dump on an app if i can not use it, and I will not go overboard about one that will not run I pick the middle ground."
13891,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-23,4,"Iheart iheartradio! The thing I like most about I heart radio is I can simply type in what I want to hear and it is there quickly. I like that I can go back to the oldies, play the latest and most popular, or just mix it up."

13903,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-23,5,"best radio app ever do not listen to the people that say u need a Facebook account cause u do not. All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones u make. Definitely worth downloading happy"
13905,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-04,5,"Works great on KindleFire eight and nine tenths good selection of music to listen to. I know that by listening I am willingly submitting to Clear Channel's hive-mind brain conditioning, that is a joke, folks, I just think they control a looot of the media and what we hear, already. But I do like the music and there is a nice selection of stations to chose from.Recommend!"
13910,"iHeartRadio",2013-07-03,3,"Listening to Sports is Good I do not use this app that often except to listen to Kent State University sports. The sound quality is good and continues to play with minimal buffering problems. Only really issue I have, and this could be with the channel I listen to, is that it seem there are about three or four commercials that are played every break. So when listening to a three hours game this can be a little annoying toward the end."

I like it because it is easy to find the music I like by artist or genre and it streams the music requested and some suggested related songs.

13918,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-08,4,"I love Iheart radio for Kindle fire! I get radio stations better than a radio. I enjoy the specialized stations especially Relaxation and meditation radio. I have not yet made my own stations but I can not wait! The alarm is loud and clear. I know I am nit picking but the only fault I can find with this app is I would like it to have multi alarms especially since I usually forget time reading on my kindle."
13923,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-01,5,"great!! Has EWTN !!! Simply awesome... You can find all kinds of your favorite stations and songs and just an all around terrific radio!!"
13929,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-23,4,"Great radio app. I did not have to log in with Facebook. This is a fantastic radio app. It has lots of artists. I intentionally searched for obscure entertainers and found them. While it does have a filter for explicit content, it is an all or nothing approach. The ads are not as obtrusive as they are on other apps. And this has a quick load time."

You should totally get this app!! I hope my review was helpful. Thanks bye"
13958,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-16,5,"better than Pandora I was in the Dominican Republic and could not use my Pandora app. I already had iHeart on another device but just did not use it much. Downloaded it to my kindle and so glad I did. It has better songs than Pandora. Plus, it is free, and they do not hound you about purchasing the ad free version. There are commercials, but very few."
13959,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-07,5,"very entertaining I love this app you get to create your own favorite station and everything. It lets me listen to my own taste of music without all the ads unlike Pandora. Not trying to bash Pandora..I adore this app"

13997,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-14,3,"katy I like this app a lot it is one of the best, plus you do not need a Facebook or email unless you want to save your customs stations but I gave this app four stars because most of the time when I get on this app it freezes and force closes every single time I even tried turning of my kindle completely and turning it back on and it still forced closes?!?"

I was able to listen to radio stations in their area and find out what was going on. While they had no power I could listen to stations they could not get on their portable radios and keep them informed until they got power and cable back. I also really like the custom stations because the radio stations in my area have changed formats."

The stations play well enough, but there is no record, pause, rewind, etc. Also, while I haven't checked exhaustively, the station list appears to be only Clear Channel.

All u have to do to stop listening is pause it. Just a bit of helpful advice."

This gives you better options than Pandora AND your local radio stations! Over all, great app. Get it soon. You will thank me"
14125,"iHeartRadio",2012-04-10,5,"Great radio/song app!!!! This is a great radio/song app. I am not sure about those reviewers who said you needed a Facebook account for this app to work, but I was able to rate songs, create radio station, save stations, etc. all with using an email address and password no Facebook account. I chose not to get daily emails upon sign up so I do not get spammed. I think I like this better than Pandora because I hear more variety and less repeats as well as newer artists. Thumbs up!!!"

14276,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-09,3,"I heartish radio This app is nice because its free. I find the songs repeat a lot on the custom built stations. The song volume is hard to control too. One song loud..one song not loud enough. I like pandora more but, I listen to I heart radio more because there is no limit on the amount of time I can listen. I do not listen to the commercial stations on I heart radio."
14284,"iHeartRadio",2016-02-04,5,"Music for Everyone. I love the various genre channels. I have three different show tune channels available. It has all the variety of the paid streaming services and then some."

14300,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-30,5,"i love this app This game is so addicting and fun, I cannot stop playing it after a high score because I am always wanting to beat it. it is not as irritating as Flappy Bird considering you feel a lot better once you beat your high score in this. You can put down Flappy Bird but you can not put this game down."
14302,"iHeartRadio",2017-02-22,5,"Five Stars I listen to several stations everyday. Crisp and clear. No more AM radio for me."
14306,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-18,1,"iHeartRadio Does not make the grade. iHeartRadio is not a user friendly App. It is difficult to set up and to navigate. I can not stand an App that feels it is necessary to send you a message at all times of day or night to tell you absolutely useless information. I have uninstalled this App and hope that the developers will make improvements."
14308,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-17,5,"Mostly works, okay for a free app. Great app. A bit buggy, but at least it mostly works. I realize all tablets are different so I do not expect perfection from all apps; I was totally unable to connect on the browser with iheart.com, until this app."
14309,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-08,4,"not as good as prior version I have used this for as long as it has been available. The latest versions do not allow the user to save favorite stations unless they have a facebook account, which I do not. The prior versions allowed this, which is obviously a timesaver so as not to have to go searching through multiple cities and stations to get to the ones I wish to listen. Otherwise the selection is quite good and I use it quite often."
14310,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-21,5,"Best app ever. Always trustworthy an does not cause any viruses or anything like other radio apps .This is a great app. My recommendation hands down"

14315,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-06,5,"awesome I really like this app because one number you get to listen to all the radio stations you like on your tablet or phone and is perfectly free and two number you get to switch on your apps and still listen to your favourite radio stations while playing on your device/phone so if you like music this is the app for you."
14317,"iHeartRadio",2017-08-13,5,"I recommend I am enjoying the music and watching movies on my fire hd tablet.I recommend both"
14321,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-27,3,"decent app I think the developers are going in the right direction with this app. One thing that still puzzles me is when I search for specific song then it will sometimes choose similar song and not the song I was searching for in the first place."
14326,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-07,5,"Love this program! Anyone who has not tried iHeart Radio is just out of touch. What a great idea! You can listen to local area stations for whatever genre you enjoy, or one of the eight hundred other stations in the US. There are preset stations, my two favs are Today's Mix and Smooth Jazz, or you can create your own station. Just plug in an artist or song, and the program will find you music in that genre. I think this is pure genius!!"
14327,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-04,5,"Love iHeart radio I did not know what to expect, but it was really easy to select the genres and it went straight to the radio stations I listen to. Very easy to choose the specific station. I really like it, so I can have it on the go."
14332,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-31,3,"It works great on my Kindle but I had to remove it ... It works great on my Kindle but I had to remove it from my phone. When the last update came through it started playing without me starting the app and would not stop till I removed the app."
14335,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-16,5,"I heart radio I like this station, mainly because I live in the country and I get few stations without static on my Bose radio. Mainly I use to listen to talk radio, which in my town is an am station.Being on my cell phone, means I always have a radio with me."

My father left me a hell of a collection that I enjoy tremendously. This is a perfect radio station for my entire family. If you are a jazz buff like me this is the smoothest place to be."
14365,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-01,5,"Great Audio Great radio stations as well as the great feature to be able to create your own station.

14384,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-11,4,"Responsive I like this app better than Spotify-it does not keep trying to force me to log into facebook. Also it seems more responsive to my preferences. The only thing missing is that it does not seem to save my favorite songs anywhere."
14385,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-19,5,"Awesome I love love love I heart radio! It is the best with creating custom midi stations. I can every type of music every song every artist that I love to listen to. Radio stations in other states and cities just totally awesome."

Really cool app. I honestly think it is WAY better than Pandora. five stars all the way."
14393,"iHeartRadio",2016-06-18,4,"good does not save thumbs up on the previously listened to songs but but provides good music quality and related song genres"

14405,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-26,5,"but I love it now I never used iHeartRadio before recently, but I love it now. I grew up in Houston, TX and moved really far away when I was 17. One of the top ten things that I missed was my old radio station. With this app I can now have my favorite station on the planet no matter where I am."

14424,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-03,5,"The best app for music If there a music app said easier to use, tell me. The definition of plug and play is iHeart Radio app. Recommend to any music lover. If iHeart does not have the genre, artists or song, does not exist or not worth listening."
14430,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,4,"Great music! Great music but you need to have speakers in the headphone jack to listen to the music pr else it is really quiet. So my advice to ClearChannel who created this would be to make the music LOUDER so we can hear or make the stations turn it up. Now my advice to the buyers would be keep calm and listen to your music with speakers."
14432,"iHeartRadio",2015-11-18,4,"Pretty good. Very good sound quality. No way to remove recommended stations from their list. I like Tunein for its facility in searching and organizing selections from all over."
14436,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-08,3,"Could use some tweaking I like that I am able to create 'channels' that I like to hear. What I do not like is when suddenly a song, from another of my channels, starts playing, yet the picture shown is a totally different song. For example: Blake Shelton channel is 'playing' and suddenly Michael W Smith comes in. Not that I do not like both artists, but this is irritating!"
14443,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-09,3,"good music but not much else Good selection of music to listen to, but at the end of the day it is still just like a radio station. You can not pick the songs, just the main artist. Creating stations is a joke because each artist has a station. Just another example of a and number 34;choice and number 34; without being able to choose."

14452,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-19,4,"Overall great, but could use some enhancements. I love this streaming app because of the lack of of obtrusive ads, but I only wish they would let us skip more on a channel or in a day. Sometimes it is pretty bad at predicting what I want to hear, but overall it is a great app."
14454,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-08,5,"amazing!!!!!!!!!! I love love love this app!!!!!! listen to those people who do not have a facebook.............. GET ONE!!!!! this app is worth it. sure just the beginning when u log in it is just a tad bit laggy but other than that you do not needto go out there and bye a dollar one hundred radio. just get this app! you can listen to any type of music or station and you can even scan through the stations if you want. it even shows u the lyrics to some songs"
14459,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-21,5,"the app crashes Now that the app works like a dream, it is definitely a five star app. I love the I love radio app!!I open the app, hit the menu button and bam! I heart radio has stopped. I used to love this app, I switched from Pandora. Now I have gone back to Pandora. Until this is fixed, I am giving it a one star!!!"
14464,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-05,5,"best music app ever We heart it is the best music app ever!

This is a five star music app."

14482,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-30,3,"can not shuffle I enjoy listening to my favorite radio stations on iheartradio. However, I do not like that although I can personalize my iheart with stations for my favorite artists, I cannot shuffle the stations to make listening more enjoyable . I will continue to use Pandora except when I am away from a radio and want to hear my favorite talk shows."
14484,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-05,5,"Five Stars Love having free music, and being able to get a variety of stations."
14492,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-12,5,"Better than Pandora! I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it is better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora, when you are first starting out and you want to make your own station, you can not just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not, it is going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it will give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that is it. Mind you I am not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it is best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
14495,"iHeartRadio",2015-12-05,1,"commercials highly outrank music More commercials than music. can not change a station without an account. Accuradio was perfect until Amazon hacked it off device now stuck with this trash"

14506,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-09,2,"Not as good as Pandora Just a large corporate attempt to clone there version of Start Up Pandora. Canned music with their spin. When the came into the Charlotte area and purchased most of the radio stations the music they offered was limited and very commercial. Gone forever Independent Radio. Only one still on the air WXRC ninety five and seven tenths Radio as it used to be."

14566,"iHeartRadio",2014-11-03,4,"good app I have really enjoyed this app. For work I have to drive most of the day and this app comes in handy when I can not find anything good on the local stations. Occasionally have trouble with the app turning off on it is own. Love it otherwise!"

When I launch the app, all I get is a white screen. I have to uninstall and reinstall in order to make it work, and I have to do this each time I want to use the app. I am going to use Pandora or Spotify instead."

Being an older male, it is very pleasing to be able to listen to a large variety of music without having to navigate around unecessary features designed for MP3's and other devices that most older adults would not even think of having. I hope they come up with a desktop icon or app to make this even more special."
14606,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-29,1,"wont uninstall It will not uninstall. I wanted to have my kindle charge more quickly. Now it say it is installed but it is not.

14643,"iHeartRadio",2013-07-29,3,"Confusing Maybe I am just not familiar with using this app, but I find it very confusing to use other than the local radio stations.

14646,"iHeartRadio",2012-04-26,5,"the best app I have downloaded to date... Very nice all around all the buttons work without fail Radio stations for every major city from Anchorage Alaska to NY NY.

18977,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-21,4,"Nothings truly free people. The Face Book requirement sucks, but here's my answer... CHEAT! I am glad I read the reviews of this app. It looks like the only major complaint is the FB for certain functionality. I have a FB account and get annoyed when I see popup notices that my old Highschool acquaintance is currently listening to Paranoid by Megadeth , you get my drift, and I hope that will not happen to me if when I sign up. I am not sure if linking the iHeart Radio to my FB will do that and I also do not want to find out the hard way. This is also EXTREME social media and somewhere in the fine print of that legal jargon nobody fully reads, they may probably get your authorization to access your contacts and more. My answer to this possible dilemma is, create a ghost FB account. I have backed out of a few cool apps in the recent past because they have required FB, it is about time I conform to the masses, but not let them win happy So go ahead and enjoy this app and do not worry about the FB aspect, just cheat."

I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type. I have found stations through the internet on my home computer, but was not able to enjoy it at work. Enter iHeart. At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem. Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference. The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I do not mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I did not give them five stars is when I am traveling, the buffer is not large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you are driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."
19336,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-11,4,"love it but it could be better... I love that I can listen to radio stations from all over without the icky advertising like Pandora. However, it will not play when I am using other apps. This is a pain."

25260,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-22,2,"way better then a mp player I can enter a song from when in high school and find it mostly. My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music."

I will keep at and see if I can not find harmony with it somehow!"
25313,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-13,5,"I Heart IHeartRadio I listen to this app everyday. I have it both on my android phone and my Kindle Fire.

25315,"iHeartRadio",2016-11-26,4,"Great Music I love this app, it would be great if I could listen to foreign music, like Korea pop, on this app as well. There is also an issue with the sound on the kindle, it keeps going out while the music continues to play."

25351,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,1,"The Kindle app is a bit frustrating I have this on my phone and I do not have problems. I like to use it on my Kindle too, but once it is launched and playing I cannot get the app back up. Music plays but the screen is blank. At first I thought it was because I had used another app and tried to come back to it, which seemed logical if a bit 2009. However it does not really matter, once the music is started the only way for it to stop is when it times out or I shut my kindle all the way down. No liking or disliking songs, no changing stations, or even knowing who the current artist is. Is anyone having problems like this? I make do but I would love an update to fix this.The good news is it is stuck on a custom station made from my favorite band. that is something at least."
25352,"iHeartRadio",2012-06-11,5,"I Heart Radio As a former radio DJ for many years I enjoy listening and sampling stations around the country.

25355,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-07,2,"Not as good as could be. But okay. I have set up several of my own stations but have not been real happy with the repetitiveness of certain songs. Seems like it focuses on just a couple of the artist's songs and replays them fairly often without digging deeper into the catalog. I wish it had more features and that the streaming rate could be checked. Also, a record button would be nice."

25421,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,3,"thump thump You know at times some of the station just repeat the song or songs that were just played before the same song the just repeated. Get what I am saying, lol. Otherwise, it is a cool app."
25424,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-02,1,"IHEART RADIO THIS APP WAS DELETED LONG, LONG AGO-- AND I CANNOT RECALL THE REASON. MOST PROBABLY THE REASON WAS THAT IT WANTED ME TO GO ONTO THE INTERNET, OR BUY SOMETHING, OR GO ONTO FACEBOOK, OR....... WHATEVER. WHATEVER THE REASON, IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED."
25426,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-21,3,"iHeartRadio I Think.... Occasionally I listen to public radio. I tune in to stations around L.A. and San Francisco. I enjoy listening to the DJs chatter games. However, do not enjoy the noise of ads."

25638,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,4,"Four Stars: Please read information below Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there is no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it will automatically choose songs or stations to play next. it will also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can not like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can not save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist. This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you do not like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that is the truth. I am here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...there is nothing really to expose."
25639,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-24,1,"sucks!!! I love music but when I get a song in my head, I want to hear that song.

25706,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-29,4,"Great app with one exception Wonderful station, with one exception that I will get to in a bit.Lots of stations from my local area stations to decade specific genre stations. I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore. Very few ads really, just occasionally when I change stations. Limited number of skips available per day, but meh, just change the station if you really can not stand that song.Now for the reason I did not give it five stars. This is an older version five. The newer version seven allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated. This version is buggy or it just does not work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire. The version seven app from Google Play loads fine on my tablet and smartphone for that station, just not this version for Kindle Fire."

25723,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-24,5,"Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora! I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? it is free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can not say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can not listen to stand up comedians, and I can not figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I am stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I do not listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I did not think it was an app problem. it is smooth, does not take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"
25725,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,5,"Great app and the execution so far has been flawless. So far this streaming radio app has performed flawlessly for me. Unlike other apps that perform on occasion this app has been reliable and I appreciate the variety of genres available. Love it!"

I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet. I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day. I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription. I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it. The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc. Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire! I would highly recommend this App to family, friends, and acquaintances! I hope my recommendation will entice anyone who reads it to try it out."
25748,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,5,"So much music I am in my fifties and recently downloaded this. I was pleasantly surprised by how much music and the variety that iHeart has. I can listen to music from my high school days at work and then find something a little louder once I get home. With the huge collection, I could probably find music from when my folks were dating."

25753,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-24,5,"Worked great on one device...will not work on the other This device is incompatible with my current Android Device. Kind of a shame, really, since the radio station I like to listen to does not have enough wattage out to reach my home. It worked on my previous Android Device beautifully.EDIT: Since getting the new Nexus Tablet, I re-downloaded this app. Now I can listen to my favorite Spokane, WA, radio station again...and Nights With Alice Cooper :D"

Meanwhile, I am happy with everything, especially the variety on my 'created' station. Also wanted to point out that FACEBOOK is your choice, not required."
25774,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-06,4,"it is a great music app. The app is amazing for listening to all of your favorite artists. The only thing that I do not particularly like is that you only have a limited amount of skips and that is kind of a bummer. Overall, though, it is a great app."
25775,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-29,5,"iLike I was looking for a little radio to listen to AM talk shows in the morning. My son told me to just download this app on my Kindle Fire, and I was like..wha? I did not know this existed, but he downloaded it for me. This works great on my fire, and I can walk around the house with it just like a radio. The sound quality is great. I am very happy with this app!"
25782,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-04,5,"Getting Better I have always preferred this over Pandora because the ads are less intrusive there are no commercials in the radio except for random times when you first open a custom radio station. Even then it only happens once, but most ads are pop-ups within the app itself. There is also no premium version that you have to pay monthly, therefore you are getting best quality already... for free! Also there are not only custom radio stations, but real radio stations all over the U.S. and Canada. Another plus over Pandora is the fact that you can and number 34;tag and number 34; a station does not matter if it is a real station or not as your favorite so that you can easily access it instead of searching for it every time or looking in your recently played section. As far as I know, there is no limit on the amount of favorites that you can have. The more you use the program there is an online website at www.iheart.com the better it gets to know you do that it can predict your search! Even better is the fact that it has gone through so many updates and bug fixes that the layout is not only easier to navigate, but also a better quality app."

I have this app on my two thousand twelve Nexus seven currently running Android Lollipop 5.1.1, a BLU Win JR running Windows Phone 8.1, a HP laptop Windows 8.1, and now on my new Fire HD seven.I noticed that this app is a bit slower to load while streaming and possibly prone to skipping I usually have it running in the background/screen off so not sure, but I did run this app on both the Nexus and Fire side by side on one of those Perfect For radio stations and noticed that the one on Android loaded new content a bit quicker, but I think that is because the Fire takes the time to remove any buy here links that are not Amazons. My guess is that there is a bit of code that looks at the next song on the playlist and if it is not available at Amazon, then that song will get automatically skipped."

Weather it is the apps one uses, or if there in no proper signals which is frustrating digital! Got to love it!. It still is an awesome app because it has the best stations to choose from and of course setting up your own stations and being able to purchase music you like. It may never be a five star app for me until it can get a clean signal that stays clean for longer than thirty minutes. It always fails when your listening to something interesting conspiracy much!!!. But it is probably my fault for its failure to totally satisfy me. Still it is worth the download."

25823,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-12,5,"Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio feature after seeing them featured online-through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area. Anyhow, as in Pandora, iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally, iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as I<U+0092>m listening to their music. I have over thirty music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance, the don<U+0092>t stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However, here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna, pet shop boys, deppeche mode, tiesto, armin van buuren, calvin harris, 2am ambient, pitbull,dancin 90s, Britney spears , adam lambert, euro-dance, Darren hayes, foofighters, the 90s unglued, one republic, lasgo, Swedish house mafia, ellie Goulding, Fergie, robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see, the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."
25826,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-01,5,"Why I like iheart Radio I like the fact that I can pick the type of music that I like,and that it gives me a variety of what I love to listen to without having to put up with stuff that I do not like,so I recommend this site for people who love music. So I give it five stars."

I was able to set up the kind of programming that I wanted.The stations were quick to come in and sound quality is very good.I am an over the hill user in that I have seen seventy a couple of years ago so my progamming tastes are dated.Even so I found the music and programming you might expect. Artie Shaw still sounds great.BUT. iHeart does a tremendous job of visuals to go along with the music.Visuals add up to excess bytes of info quickly.I had to uninstall the APP as my data usage count surged in just a few uses.If I had a good internet connection with more data per month I would be back to iHeartRadio it is a very good product.It is much better than most of the internet radio apps that I have tried. It is a good one.I wish I could keep it."

Not just one short group, but two and sometimes three of them. I like to listen to my choice of programming and do not care about Justin Bieber top five or whoever else they want to plug. Needless to say I will be finding something else and switching."

25857,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-13,5,"Very torn on this rating.... I loved the way my son has been able to use this on his iphone, so that is why I wanted it on my tablet, but it has not been as great for me. When I tried to open it, I had to answer a bunch of questions, and it forced a sign in either through my Facebook or email. I was going to choose Facebook, but then found this is yet another app that wants permission to pretend to be me, and I will NEVER permit any app to do that. So, back to the sign in. It proceeded smoothly with the email option, but once I got in, it basically took over my tablet. I could not use anything else, and I HEART RADIO basically froze on my screen. I had to completely reboot to turn it off. Doubt I will use it again on my tablet, which is a pity. I do like the product, though. My son has it on his iphone, which plugs into his car system by USB, and I love the created station option, which lets us pick a genre, and hear the kind of music we prefer without ads and chat. it is great for road trips."

25886,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-16,4,"Good app, a few glitches Overall this is a really great app. I would have given it five stars except there are a couple of things that bug me about it using it on my Kindle fire. For one is the commercial you are forced to listen to every time to power the app up. it is fairly short, so it is sufferable, but it is still annoying. The other thing is that the radio will just go off for no reason. you will be listening and then all of a sudden nothing. Also, I was a bit confused by the create your own station aspect of the app. I typed in one of my fav. singers and thought it would play just his songs, but it did not, it plays anyone that is a similar genre, which is okay, just was not what I expected. The app is great especially since it is free and you can take your radio station anywhere in the house with you, which is nice if you do not have good radio reception."
25891,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-11,5,"Great App I have been finding all kinds of music I had forgotten about. I just found a genuine oldies station out of Minneapolis that plays music from the 50's and 60's. I live in Georgia so this is the only way for me to tune in to this great music. XM radio is too expensive on my retirement income."

25940,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-13,3,"Not the best radio app for a Kindle, but it is OK. A decent app, but not the very best for radio listening. It does load quickly on a Kindle HD but the interface is a little clunky and takes too much user action to search and the station list, domestic and international, is very small compared to other services.Recommended stations automatically pop up and the developers should take a look at whatever algorithm they use for this feature because most of the stations recommended for me are way off the mark when compared to the stations I have been selecting. it is frustrating.Icons and text are a size geared more for smartphone screens rather than Kindle screens. For a Kindle, it would be more efficient and easier to use if they were smaller."
25946,"iHeartRadio",2017-09-22,3,"it is ok its super choppy, its always stopping and starting, and sometimes i have to press play again, but i can not find anything better."
25952,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-07,5,"iHeartRadio is great. I live and work in an area where the radio stations are few and they talk alot.I work in a metal building and the radio stations are very finicky about coming in and hanging thru the day.I was using Pandora and I did not mind them having an occasional commercial, but it totally locks up on commercials and I lose my music. Very annoying. I am constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial. So I downloaded iHeart. it is great. It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle, but so far it was well worth it and it did not cost anything to download the app thru Amazon. You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account, but it works great. I recommend it. I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."
25963,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-04,4,"Local station for The Big Show I do not like the hard rock played on the local iHeart station, or any station for that matter. But the local Columbus, Georgia,,,and surrounding Alabama..station one hundred three ten2.9 runs the John Boy and Billy. Big Show six days a week from sixam to ten am EST. And I faithfully listen to the show. I can get it on my Android phone and iPad as well! So I rate a four star to iHeart for having the programming flexibility for airing the Big Show. Other people I know say the same and that iHeart should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for twenty hours and all day Sunday, when the Big Show is not broadcast!"

I am unable to select the radio channels I listen to such as my local PBS channels. The classic rock statin I listen to also can not be selected. I wanted to use IHeart Radio on my TV in my living room because the radio reception, especially for AM radio, in my area is really terrible. I was also not able to find certain talk show hosts on IHeart radio either. Very disappointing."
25970,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-19,4,"Great app!!! I love this app. It gives you different radio station to listen to. Even the ones outside your local station. it is easy to use. You can save your favorite channels and there is a search box to look for specific ones. The two cons for me are the commercials that comes on when the station is first turned on, in addition to the commercials that comes on with the regular radio stations, but it is only for less than a minute so that is ok and that it only works using WiFi or internet access. With this being a free app and it being convenient on my kindle fire and tmobile phone I can not complain. I will give it a five star if those two cons were pro. it is still a great app though happy"
25975,"iHeartRadio",2012-04-25,5,"Great Radio App This App works well! You can listen to your favorite radio stations through your cell phone or tablet! I love to be able to switch from the radio in my car, to continue listening on my phone when I get somewhere. Also, if you are out of town, or have a favorite station in a city that you used to live in, you can access those stations through this app!It works a lot better now than it did when initially released. I have very few problems with it. It usually builds up a slight delay from the actual radio station, but that just allows you to skip some commercials if you restart it at the beginning of a commercial break!I highly recommend this app to people that enjoy listening to radio stations without interruptions after leaving their car or home!"

While I used Facebook to register, it does support an e-mail alternative. I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said, the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can not receive locally. The app installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.Recommended!CFH"

26549,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-21,1,"Iheart radio app I am pretty disappointed in the Iheart radio app. I have loaded it on my iphone and tried it out for several hours. I tried to get Christmas music and it did not do very well the first few songs were rap versions of Christmas and it would then not let me skip the ones I did not like. I tried instrumental which by definition should not contain any vocals and within a couple of songs came up with vocals I was able to skip the first few then I hit the skip limit. I tried several other stations like Mannheim steamroller and soon had rap again. I then tried Trans Siberian and ended up after a few songs with some pretty heavy hard rock and techno rock. Which is fine but not what I had asked for. I had a lot better luck with Pandora in the past. I may have to reload Pandora and use it instead."

Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."

26724,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-26,4,"I like it as a whole I like it as a whole, but I find it a little hard maneuvering around songs. It may just be me because others I have talked to did not have any problems."
26725,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-05,5,"Filled with stations we love to listen to My kids love to listen to Christian music and Christian radio stations. They got some cheap MP3 players from a relative for Christmas and were all excited until after the batter ran down the first time we could not recharge them. I spent a great deal of time trying to decide whether to replace with MP3 players, ipods, ipads, ..... We already had a kindle and we are all sharing it, so after some consideration and test driving iHeartRadio, I decided to get them kindles."

26731,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-21,2,"throwing things annoyed it is a great app when it actually works. For some reason, every time I try to open it, it tells me iheartradio has stopped , I have spent more time trying to get it to work than actually using it! Done everything tech support has told me to do, even tried uninstalling. If this is supposed to be the best radio app ever it sucks. I am very VERY disappointed!! It got two stars for the sheer fact that the UI was good and easy to use and when the app worked it was great and played all my favorites. Fix the force close and you have five stars from me."

26746,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-28,4,"Pandora is better I downloaded this app because of buzz on the radio. it is pretty cool because you can get local radio stations which in my location, do not come in on the real radio. I, however still prefer Pandora to this and hardly ever use this app anymore."

Now to the whole Facebook thing you do not need a Facebook to access this app you can you use your yahoo or google account to listen to your music and save a station . Did i mention its free !! Definitely worth it worth what you ask that is the point no sticking your neck out to listen to music great right"

26796,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-22,5,"THE BEST I had Pandora for the longest time until I found iHeartradio, now I use this ALL the time so many radios, you can listen to radios that are going on on the actual RADIO :0 not by setting the am/cm but by choosing them by name, and then, like Pandora you can listen to song and artist radios but unlike pandora, you can make stations and number 34;Favorite Stations and number 34; that you can access from the menu on the side. I use it for relaxation, and exercising. .Best Music App Ever."
26799,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-09,4,"Best radio App out there. I was a Pandora user like most of us, that was until they had a six song limit or whatever it was. I HEART is a good App that is one hundred percent free and you can find just about any radio station you are looking for. I moved to Houston about two years ago and Houston is where I reside now. The one thing I missed most was the music. I found both of my favorite Hawaiian reggae stations on IHEARTRADIO. So I am able to keep up with the new jams comin out of Hawai'i! it is a blessing!"

26810,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-09,5,"Amazing!!!!! I believe this is way better than Pandora or Slacker radio. So far, I haven't seen any limits in skipping or time. It rarely buffers, skips, or crashes. I also haven't seen one song play twice and I have found many new bands that I have never even heard of that I absolutely love! I look at all of the bad rated reviews and they look like personal problems or user error. Nothing wrong with the app itself."

It works so well, it is amazing. For example, I like to hear a few people on KFI Lost Angels--I mean, Los Angeles. Well, I can get them here, on anything! I may even try to get them on my 'lectric toothbrush.

My parents would play it in the car, house, records, my brothers and sister would pretend to be in a band and use out funiture for drums, keyboards, etc., I was always listening.

When I am not gaming, writing, reading, or just want to listen to the internet radio I turn on my iHeart. I select the genre and stations thta I want or the app can make suggestions for you.I usually pick a few local stations for hard rock and some distant stations also. You dont have to log on to your Facebook Account when setting it up, just skip for later."
26935,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-08,5,"AMAZING!!! This app is amazing due to its ability to play the music you love based on what you like and do not like. They base your music stations on the type and likeness of music you choose. If I were you I would download this app right now. Its free and you do not even have to create an account to listen to you favorite music."

It does not just ply a song you like once and never play it again, it will actually play the songs you like. The other best part is you can have alot of stations and out of those you can make favorites and they will all be in their own section and easy to get to."

I read the reviews to see what everyone else was saying first though. I did not realize you had thlo log into facebook. Sure, I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio, but it shows what you are listening to. I am not going to download it because I do not want my friends to know what I am listening to. If you want my opinion, just get Pandora. it is free and all you need is an email."
26988,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-19,5,"Pandora sucks I Heart radio the bome This is way better than pandora now bc u do not need to upgrade to the paid app for the advertisement at the bottom or any commercial free .or do I heart radio support commercial .but so far it is pretty good app to me"
26991,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,1,"WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait fifteen to sixty seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process. Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps.. With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can not find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal. It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating. I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all. If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch. It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to. An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

I was listening to three days grace, when it started playing Nickleback, which I personaly do not enjoy. Also, there is a daily skip limit, so when you get a bunch of songs you do not like, you can not skip all of them. In the end, if you want to listen to specific music, this is not for you."

27632,"Pandora",2014-02-05,5,"Highly recommended I have been a Pandora user for quite some time. I use it on all my computers at home and at my office. I appreciate the fact that I can input the artists and style of music I prefer. If something is played I would rather not listen to again I can input that fact. I can listen to my playlist randomly, or select a particular artist/style to play. I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I am reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle. I have tried several other downloadable music sites, and have found Pandora to be the most versatile and have the greatest choice of music as well as being the easiest to use."

27635,"Pandora",2013-02-04,4,"Like it! Panadora is one of my favorite FREE apps. I use this app all the time when working out, and I love the variety of music they have for free on here!

27639,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain I guess that is the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."

It does not do anything else because it does not have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient."
27682,"Pandora",2013-07-14,5,"1st app This was my 1st app on my new KFHD and I love it. The device has good speakers and with Pandora you can program your favorites. Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that is not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it and esp at no cost."

I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it is gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening.

28203,"Pandora",2015-09-03,5,"I like this much more than I thought I would I like this much more than I thought I would! I have tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly. I do not want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that is exactly what this provides. Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data that this does not use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data. There are a ton of visual advertisements!!! But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I do not see them. I do not know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."
28204,"Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Better than Slacker, in my opinion. I like this so much better than the Slacker app. It just seems like Pandora is a lot better at picking music that I like instead of Slacker. Slacker will play some raaaaaaaandom stuff!

29021,"Pandora",2014-03-27,3,"A little more annoying then useful I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I do not like and that are not even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."
29023,"Pandora",2014-08-12,5,"Best free music available on the web Best free music available on the web. I have it now on my smart TV's and my Smart Phone and computer.

29105,"Pandora",2013-12-08,4,"Good as far as it goes Good selections tied to one's choice of artist, although one would like more controlafter a first extended listen. A thumbs up for a song tends to spread the choices even more, asit increases the branching links rather than narrow the range."

Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. never received an error message before upgradingit got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer. I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they would never delivered. Granted it was only four or five dollars at that point, but i do not have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they did not deserve that money at all.Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

30211,"Pandora",2016-12-25,4,"Four Stars Great App"
30217,"Pandora",2013-03-10,3,"not as good as they use to be. I love the fact that I can listen to just about any type of music I want. I like old rock music, but when I am at work I can not listen to rock because I work with seniors so I put in big band or musicals and the seniors love it. The only problem is that they play to many commercials now."
30218,"Pandora",2016-10-06,1,"One Star Did not buy this product"
30220,"Pandora",2014-04-13,5,"WHAT DID i EVER DO WITHOUT MY PANDORA???!! I love everything about my Pandora. I have been able to be free to create my own unique music store and set it up however I want and with all the music I want at any time and with very little commercials. And it is FREE!!!"
30223,"Pandora",2016-02-04,4,"Good, but limited to the west Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
30230,"Pandora",2013-01-23,3,"it is free but has some annoying features Advertising is necesary to pay the costs of the service but in Pandora's case, it is invasive and annoying.When creating a latin radio station, I gave several options of musicians but Pandora kept playing the same cheap mexican american music.Not really impressed with the product."
30236,"Pandora",2014-01-06,5,"Pandora I love Pandora on my Kindle. It is convenient and easily accessible. I is free, and I can take it anywhere. I will be flying and know that I will be spending lots of time in airports, so it is nice to know I have Pandora available."
30238,"Pandora",2016-07-26,2,"Pandora is not my faviorte I prefer Rhapsody. Easier to navigate..."
30239,"Pandora",2016-02-24,4,"more hints I do like this game, just wish they would give more hints after each level"
30245,"Pandora",2017-03-11,4,"Good, could be great Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to normalize the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up and thumbs down seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few deep tracks , just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"

30390,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"LOVE! Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe should not hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons thumbs or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it is great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"
30393,"Pandora",2016-08-10,5,"Thank you I am glad I have this! No problems."
30394,"Pandora",2013-04-12,5,"Performs as expected As music stream services go, this is a good one. I only use the ad-supported version, and I have seen the ads to be very wela placed, and do not interrupt the music so much. The app has helped me find artists I have never heard about, and their music has been a joy to listen."
30398,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"Music it is great being being able to specifically listen to exactly what I chose with little to know interruption ! it is like never having to flip a record or turn over perpetually to hear all the same artist 's music!! It 's priceless!!"

30438,"Pandora",2014-07-14,5,"Love Its free music who would not love it! One request though is there any way you can make it to where you have an option of listening to just the person you want instead of having many other bands."

30777,"Pandora",2012-12-19,4,"Music with a bang. I chose this radio because of its great diversity in music choice. Ive only used it a few times, but the artists available are aplenty.I do question wether or not one has to rate each song like other online radios, for the music to continue its playing. That gets a bit tedious."

I love how it finds songs I like, even though I never knew before that I liked them.

30838,"Pandora",2012-12-30,5,"Review for Pandora. free music= awesome. you can make your own music station based on artist, genre, or even individual songs. You have a limited number of skips, though so use them wisely. I recommend making many stations of the same kind of music and switching between them to minimize on skip usage."
30845,"Pandora",2013-06-14,3,"Having trouble navigating and also expensive I am new to my kindlefire.

31510,"Pandora",2014-11-25,5,"I enjoyed it from start to finish If this is a referral for Pandora by Anne Rice, then I definitely give it five stars. Pandora describes the life of a Roman woman of the upper class two thousand years ago. It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Pandora is one of Anne's vampire books but like all her vampire books, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities."
31511,"Pandora",2014-06-13,5,"Its the greatest! I love Pandora. It lets me select from many favorites, I especially like the songs from the 60's 70's. The best part is that I can play it on my smart phone with ear plugs."

31514,"Pandora",2016-02-23,5,"Variety is Great I have been using Pandora for years now. I listen to it at work and home. One word of caution - even though it may say music for work be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity. It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting. I would not use music for work if it was an educational setting even in an office. But that is just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down. Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."

31562,"Pandora",2013-10-06,4,"Great app If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you. I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app. However, there are a few problems:forty hour limit: for mobile devices, you get forty hours of music per week. that is a little over five hours per day, which is good if you do not listen to as much as I do I am almost constantly listening to musicAds: not too bad, the limit is what gets me. What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.Sure, they give a couple good solutions. The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that is just for a month. Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right. If you have access to a computer, that is the best option in my opinion. However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer is not on and ready."

31604,"Pandora",2012-10-18,4,"Pandora radio This is a good product. I signed up for the free Pandora radio and I have not been disappointed. You pick the style of artist and music you enjoy listening to and a good variety is provided. I could go without the commercials, but you have got to take the good with the bad."
31607,"Pandora",2016-03-21,5,"what is not to love?! it is Pandora, who does not love Pandora?!"
31609,"Pandora",2013-04-22,5,"Music Rocks I love this app. It is easy to use and lets you choose what channel you like listening to. It wlll give you a variety of different Like songs to the type you requsted. I do not like that you can only skip six songs in an hour and it MAKES you listen to those you do not like. I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the no commercials aspect, which I have. Also, I listen to it at work and if you do not Like or Dislike evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE do not LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM what the ????I mean really? They pay? No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me. But again the music is good and I do like the app."
31612,"Pandora",2013-04-30,5,"Great App Pandora has been around for a while and most people know how well it works. I use it every morning to listen to music while riding my motorcycle to work. Picking a favorite channel is a breeze and I usually do not have to skip songs I do not like."

32245,"Pandora",2014-07-05,4,"The Pleasure Of Good Music...Pandora I have listened to Pandora music for over a year now, and I have enjoyed the freedom and variety of music offered through this app. It syncs well with my laptop and I know that it keeps a record of all my favorite thumbs up songs. I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on.My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it."

It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track will not play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait. there is one more thing that does not work; it is the search engine for music stations, which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review, I really do not recommend this..."

34643,"Pandora",2015-08-06,5,"Love Pandora! I think Pandora is the best option for listening to music, other than maybe the actual radio. The commercial breaks are not that long, and they are not ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there is no limit on how many channels you can have. there is the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there is always the alternative and unlimited way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can not think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you do not have internet you can not use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!"

35107,"Pandora",2012-11-15,4,"Update Looking for Exit... Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD? The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might Misbehave haha.. it is already misbehaving!! While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can quit instead of forceclosing, thank you.A sleep timer will complete the app and make it five star!I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.If the ads bother you, it is easy to fix, just get the paid app.After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you are not it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."
35108,"Pandora",2013-08-10,5,"Pandora is a Great Internet Radio Service So happy with Pandora. I can listen to just about any song and it is free. Subscription, which frees it of ads is low cost. I do not mind the ads as the are very short."

35203,"Pandora",2013-02-26,4,"The phone/table version of the website application. The application works fine, so or dollar zero it does what it should. The Pandora site itself does not have quite as extensive a collection as I would like, but for the money, I find it well worth it."
35205,"Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"not defective after all I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nook app. However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time. What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it. That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened. Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over fifty and what is supposed to be intuitive to many is not intuitive to me. Anyway, I am thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD. I would have rated it with five stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."

35284,"Pandora",2012-12-05,5,"Love it. I love that Pandora alows you to pick a style of music and plays music that is similar. It allows me to experience music that I may not have tried since the radio sticks to the same songs over and over."
35288,"Pandora",2013-05-10,5,"fabulous You can type in your favorite artist and Pandora builds a station based on that. For great old blues from the '20s, '30s and beyond, try Robert Johnson . very fine stuff."

37610,"Pandora",2015-06-13,2,"which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly Meh. I am tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? will not renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they are focused on a young audience."

My only real complaint about Pandora is that you cannot press thumbs down an unlimited amount of times. It keeps giving me R and B type songs for some reason, and it will not let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."

38385,"Pandora",2014-01-06,2,"good music, but crappy glitches I like the music, it plays a lot of good songs. But for me there are three major glitches to work out.1. It will not let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.2. Half the time it will not let me listen to music, it will say that it can not find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and has not gotten any better, it is done that to me very time this week I have tried to listen.3. When the warning first popped up, it said I had forty eight hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.So Pandora, I am willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I will not go any higher than that because of the glitches, I would appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

38562,"Pandora",2015-04-27,5,"Five Stars Love pandora!"
38565,"Pandora",2013-06-28,3,"A little disappointing. sad I love rock music like Led Zeppelin. I tried to type in Led Zeppelin and my favorite song, Stairway to Heaven, but it shows a lot other music that you do not want to listen to. <U+00B7>You can type in The Beatles then Jimmy Hendrix could show up. You only get three skips to skip a song you do not like. Total rip off. You can not listen to the music you typed in; only random music of that genre. <U+00B7>Also, it does not even let you make a playlist of your favorite music. You will be lucky if you get a few songs by that artist or the one song you typed in. Sometimes even if you do not get the song you want, you can listen to others that you might like. <U+00B7> Another flaw is that you can not listen to the same song again after you listen to it once. You cannot replay nor can you rewind or fast forwarded songs.Waste of time for those of you who want to listen to certain music.I give this 5/10."
38567,"Pandora",2015-03-07,5,"it is great It is has awesome music"

38599,"Pandora",2012-12-20,5,"Easy access to fresh music A pretty solid app, especially if you drop the thirty six dollar for a yearly subscription, it allows continuous play of music based on your input. Like a song or band or genre? Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it will not play it again.it is not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."

39248,"Pandora",2014-12-23,5,"Five Stars Fantastic music selections."
39249,"Pandora",2014-07-26,3,"How wonderful life is with Pandora in the world I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke dollar ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too! happy"
39255,"Pandora",2015-07-15,5,"Pandora is AWESOME! Okay, I admit it, I am addicted to Pandora now. Before I got it I did not understand what the hype was....Why not just listen to the radio? I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I do not like. There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get five minutes worth of commercials at a time. When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth. It has become part of my driving routine. I also connect it to a stereo so I can listen while cleaning, doing yard work, or swimming in the pool."
39258,"Pandora",2014-10-04,5,"Five Stars Love having it on my kindle, to hear music"

39269,"Pandora",2013-09-20,4,"How did it know that? it is very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it is best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. what is really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and do not like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste. I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I am really amazed at how well it works.On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app."

So I was pretty upset about that cause I really like Pandora but I guess I can still use it on a regular computer. Honestly I think a great app for a kindle fire or any tablet would be Iheartradio because its free,you never have to pay and it is somewhat similar to what Pandora gives you and also you can listen to your favorite radio stations. But overall Pandora is an awesome app it just sucks it is not always going to be free."

They are now some of my favorite singers. The only problem are the ads. They are not super bad, it is just that they happen at all. it is just a commercial off and on, or tap the banner below to go to blah blah blah .My advice : just do not skip every single song. It makes more commercials! Also, when you skip, you eventually use up all your skips for an hour. Other than that, it is a great app!"

41944,"Pandora",2013-06-26,4,"Like It a Lot I have been a Pandora subscriber for about two years. For me, it is well worth paying for and it is taken the place of our defunct stereo system. I do not use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music. I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group. Being introduced to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to. The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music. Overall, I am pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days. I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that does not work for me. So far, it is a perfect solution for me."

42027,"Pandora",2016-09-16,5,"LOVE IT and HATE IT Love every purpose intended.... but like when I run out of skips it happens to stations I have listened to in days. And a few times every time I skip it sometimes plays the same song back to back three times in a row. Other than the stupid, small flaws.... I love it"
42029,"Pandora",2017-02-02,1,"annoying it keeps coming on when I am doing something else on another menu. I can not get rid of it unless I completely close down my device."
42032,"Pandora",2013-01-25,3,"Not the best version It plays well but I feel limited in how it plays. The screen is clear but not easy to use."
42035,"Pandora",2015-02-13,2,"Poor Qualtiy and Selecton I find that when you create a radio station that the same songs play over and over again. In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as Simon and Garfunkel. I know S and G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many songs - you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at 'live' events, I prefer the higher quality studio songs - I do not seem to have any choice in the issue. No longer using Pandora."
42039,"Pandora",2013-01-12,4,"hi it is not that good but it a app what can u do lol so get it or dont haha"
42040,"Pandora",2013-01-04,5,"Love Pandora Works great, easy download and streams well.... .. . . . . . . . . . . . ."
42041,"Pandora",2014-04-02,5,"very good music variety Put this on my Kindle and also my computer as I really enjoy listening to music. When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists. You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres. Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect. For example, I can not remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young. Not generally a big deal or problem. I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than thirty seconds and for me are not bothersome."
42050,"Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly Pandora used to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed. You have to go through three screens just to close the program. It does not support the menu button. It turns on and off randomly, so you can not let it idle in the background. Perfect, now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car, leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I am in a meeting or library. Awesome.... Fix your app, Pandora. There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium these issues."
42051,"Pandora",2016-05-16,4,"what was the point??? I love the app but one problem: the comment section. People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information. And I keep saying, do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen. . And people are just being inappropriate. So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."
42052,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"Dont like their official app Too many ads"
42053,"Pandora",2013-09-06,5,"Free music I use al the time instead of playing my radio at home and in the car. This app is a must have."
42062,"Pandora",2016-04-06,1,"Tired of it taking over my camera.... This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone."
42065,"Pandora",2016-05-10,3,"Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in ... I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the dollar fifteen / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they did not have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
42068,"Pandora",2014-05-08,1,"Excited, and then... I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and... It did not work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it does not work everywhere. It just works in the US.Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I could not even use it, so, what is the point?Thanks, and put useful to this review, please.Oh, I think you would like hotspot fm. Look for I, it is free.Thanks"
42071,"Pandora",2013-06-03,5,"pure amazing! This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!"
42073,"Pandora",2012-03-05,4,"Pandora Great Great i love it you can mix your music to the way you like it and its all free.Did i say free."

42086,"Pandora",2016-07-16,5,"Great app for phone: pandora I have been a Pandora subscriber for years and only recently added this app to my phone. The same channels I created for my laptop/desktop automatically are there with phone app. No set up or cumbersome issues to get started with app"
42087,"Pandora",2012-01-24,5,"Beyond Awesome!! I got this app for my T301 and it is AWESOME! I can jam to the radio all day long for FREE!"
42089,"Pandora",2014-05-26,1,"This is ridiculous! I did not even get a chance to listen to music on Pandora because it will load on my Kindle for literally two seconds and then it says it timed out then goes back to the home screen. Seriously! It timed out after two seconds! I would rate this zero stars if I could. I love Pandora the app works on my phone but why not this. I am uninstalling and reinstalling and hope that it is fixed."
42090,"Pandora",2016-11-13,5,"hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you ...

It was very user friendly and simple to navigate through . I think this is a good app ."
42098,"Pandora",2013-01-22,5,"Pandora Media Review I really do like this app. My niece turned me on to this app. It is a great music media app, it to me is one of the best apps for music. I really do like the different genres for music. The music really sounds good on the Kindle Fire HD, because of the dolby audio sound system. I could listen to it all day long. I would and have recommended it to friends."
42099,"Pandora",2014-02-14,5,"Best music streaming app. I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available. They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres. Great job Pandora."
42102,"Pandora",2016-11-11,5,"LOOOOOOVE I love Pandora. It does not repeat songs over and over, it has almost evey artist younwould want. Love this, a total must have. Except for the fact that you habento pay for premium, but whatever."

42117,"Pandora",2016-06-06,5,"I have discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to. I can not live without my Pandora now. Takes a little patience to develop the perfect playlist like a couple/three sessions of thumbs up or down, but it is SO worth it. I have discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to."
42118,"Pandora",2016-12-09,1,"Never downloaded Was never able to download it so how can I review it?"
42119,"Pandora",2016-05-17,4,"sometimes good, sometimes not quite Works well and introduces you to new music similar to the station you choose. sometimes good, sometimes not quite. Still, a good way to learn and appreciate all the great music there is. Just wish in the Classical stations they would play the entire piece rather than movements or excerpts. Guess listening to something longer than a few minutes is very old school."
42121,"Pandora",2017-01-28,5,"love it Great app, works well only droid maxi."
42125,"Pandora",2016-07-17,4,"it has awesome graphics and if you buy one Amazon does have ... After many conversations with represenatives we finally came to a successful ending on the Kindle Fire HDX seven inch. I am still learning how to use it , it has awesome graphics and if you buy one Amazon does have cases for them but it is only for the HDX third generation.And you can put an one hundred twenty go SD card in it. Lots of movies lots of music.Enjoy"

42138,"Pandora",2016-12-19,1,"unable to access I was not able to log in so I did not use the app on my Kindle. Pandora said they could not log me in so maybe it was my mistake but after two tries, I gave up."
42144,"Pandora",2016-04-28,3,"Why I switched to Spotify. A frustrating app at times. It will occasionally pop up an overly that demands you either give the song its showing a thumb up or a thumb down. The only way to regain control of the app with out giving a thumb up or a thumb down is to exit the app and restart it. Very annoying. Paying for premium does not give unlimited skips like Spotify does."
42147,"Pandora",2017-03-12,5,"Five Stars Great product!"
42151,"Pandora",2017-03-24,5,"Beyond a radio stand in; still the best music discovery tool I love Pandora and have been following it since the beginning. I told my dad that it would be everywhere one day and, I will be darned if it is not standard in a lot of cars and TVs now. It still beats all the new services, like Spotify, since I think the system of music DNA they use is better at creating channels that introduce you to new music."
42152,"Pandora",2013-07-30,5,"Hi again, If you like one of them you liked them all. I do not understand why it is a limit on your response."
42160,"Pandora",2013-01-22,4,"only one minor problem Pandora is free, it is great for finding new music in a particular genre. The only problem is, it keeps playing after you exit the app, that is great if you want music while you work on other things, but not so great if you do not, I cannot find any way to shut it off other than turning the whole Kindle off."
42164,"Pandora",2014-06-16,1,"terrible You should not get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game, or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it would not even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs, or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
42165,"Pandora",2016-08-28,4,"Great if your on Wifi Pandora is great for finding music similar to what I like. I use it on my PC all the time. I do not use it on my phone much since it uses the cell data plan when not on Wifi. It would be great if it would download say thirty minutes of music to listen to off-line. Then I could use it on my commute to/from work and such without paying me for cell data."

42182,"Pandora",2013-11-19,2,"BSOD Used to work great, then stopped. I updated hoping it would fix it but made it worse. It used to begin playing eventually after a few times of exiting and restarting program. Now, it usually will not. Also, I play lullabies for my baby when it works and before the update there were rarely commercials. Now loud, multiple ones play at random, which is fine when she is awake, sucks when she just dozed off."
42188,"Pandora",2014-04-12,5,"The most extensive music variety on the planet! Pandora is quite simply the go-to destination when you are looking for a particular genre of music you can dial in and let play. it is never let me down for variety of newer and older favorites of whatever type of music I am in the mood for and the best thing is, you can take it anywhere. I like having it on my phone for portability in the car to hook up to my cars stereo or at home on my computer or stereo. Wherever you are, wherever you go, be it near or far, it is Pandora!"

I am tired of getting a skip limit when i do not want to listen to certain songs on my stations. Also Pandora is apparently not available to certain countries such as Ecuador. So when i was down there i could not even use the service or even cancel my service. Now back in the US i cancelled my subscription. Not dealing with it anymore after being a customer for a few years. Wish i cancelled it sooner. I have thousands of songs on my hard-drive just was lazy to deal with it."

42216,"Pandora",2013-08-13,4,"Music ... Music, yes, but unless you go for more than the free app, you are not choosing your music. It is Pandora 'radio,' not Pandora 'you pick it, you play it.' If you do not like the chosen song, you must still listen to it.It may not be just what I wanted, but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can not hardly go wrong with this one. sticking tongue out"

42224,"Pandora",2014-11-30,1,"Less than a star I suppose this app is okay if one listens to only English music. I listen exclusively to Italian and French music. It is next to impossible to find the artists I love. Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia, Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar. It is useless to me. I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that does not presume and actually reads my search criteria."

It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support. After five minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone. My kids love it; but my experience was awful. iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I have never had a problem with it......guess I will use that from now on."
42228,"Pandora",2015-12-30,1,"will not play on kindle fire Like many other recent reviewers said, the app does not work on kindle fire or at least not on mine and theirs.

42230,"Pandora",2016-09-27,1,"Was a great music media app More music then all the thousands of dollars that I wish I saved VS what was wasted on CDs and tapes, LPs and cassettes and Itunes it is a good app BUT now they stop it after fifteen min.s of play, Ask you if your still listening, it stinks now before it was like a radio with your favourite songs, Now you have to press the button and start it again, Time to get another app, many others, so long,,, Maybe back if you go back to the old way"
42232,"Pandora",2017-01-11,4,"Free and awesome music, does it get any better ? I have had Pandora for years ! I absolutely love it and the selection of channels and variety of music they have available. I am giving this a four star rating because I do wish new music would become available a little bit more often other than every few weeks on the stations you select to listen to. If you are looking for a good music station, I highly recommend Pandora. My absolute favorite internet radio station of all time !"
42235,"Pandora",2016-09-21,2,"Breaks often Often need to uninstall, reinstall and losing all your favorites. When it works, very nice even with annoying commercials."

True. it is very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and does not change. I hope they fix the bugs! I can not complain too much because the app was free, but it is still frustrating."
42241,"Pandora",2013-08-31,3,"Love it and hate it I love Pandora and am a paid subscriber. However, every time I want to launch it I have to go into Apps and do a shut down. It does not always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature. Then it will launch ok. I talked to kindle support about this several weeks ago and they were able to reproduce the problem. They said they would research and get back to me within five days but I am still waiting. I am getting ready to call them back."

42273,"Pandora",2017-07-05,2,"So repetive! It does not matter if I listen to a station for three hours or twenty; I can thumbs up and down all day long and still it plays the same twenty songs by the sameten artist. I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I am so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it is the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. it is torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I will just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about ten stations I made, 5-ten others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I have tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every threerd song. There used to be an add variety feature but I have had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I do not always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it is just a hassle."
42274,"Pandora",2016-03-16,1,"does not work I had two stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs would not play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that did not work. Ridiculous."

It also stops playing music and asks if you want to upgrade to a fee version - you have to answer and then tell it to go back to playing the music. If you want some background music while working around the house this is not a very good option. I went back to playing Pandora on my Blue-ray player because it does not have as many interruptions."

42299,"Pandora",2015-03-02,1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ... When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of three and ninety nine one hundredths per month. All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they did not get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged four and ninety nine one hundredths per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I do not mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."

However eight times out of ten, the app and number 34;is having technical difficulties and number 34; or will not recognize the correct log in information.

I love that i can have this app on my computer and on each of my devises and it will sync with all of them so all of my music is right where i put it. Pandora allows you to listen to music for free, with commercials. I wish that i could choose what song i wanted to listen to but that is OK. You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening. I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from. If you want to you can upgrade to Pandora monthly service for just four and ninety nine one hundredths which is not a bad price if you listen to it a lot and do not want the commercials and you want more skips. all in all this is a great app for music lovers"
42315,"Pandora",2013-09-23,1,"HATE IT!!!! sad to be honest, I do not even want to give this app one star!! Pandora used to be my favorite music app but now you only get a few hours to listen to music!!! Also if you use your six skips, its for every single station!! whenever I used my skips I would just go to another station and be fine.... now I cant!!!

42326,"Pandora",2013-03-08,5,"BEST IDEA EVER!!! I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i did not have to listen to ads anymore. I have never been happier with any other music source. As long as you have internet, this is the way to go one hundred percent of the time. I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire, It is the best thing that ever happened to Music. Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down. If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like. It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved. The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using. It is just too great for words."

I woke up and discovered the screensaver on and burning up the battery, but no music until I entered my password. Maybe there is a workaround? Hopefully would not require yet another Android permission. How much personal data do you guys need to collect? I am sure ad revenue and paid versions generate considerable profit. We know the musicians are not being compensated appropriately. As far as the app's overall consistency I will say that things run smooth and it is enjoyable to hear mainstream and number 34;radio and number 34; hits from time to time. One thing I liked about the old Yahoo Music Jukebox an earlier platform of audio streaming Pandora seems to have modeled itself on was having the opportunity to hear much deeper tracks from artists I never knew about."

42447,"Pandora",2015-10-11,1,"BLAHHHHHHHZAY! C GRADE! Terrible selections - very limited, unless you only follow easy listening or mainstream for the masses. Classical very limited. I searched ?

42452,"Pandora",2016-01-29,1,"I have lost my patience with it. I loved Pandora, but lately it has not been playing properly.

42648,"Pandora",2015-10-21,3,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening.

I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can not. I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I am used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS do not PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that.

The only thing I do not like is when I choose a song from a performer as a radio the song does not play. I have to wait for it to eventually come up. For instance I really, really wanted to hear Over the Rainbow by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my radio. Another song played and I never could get Over the Rainbow. Other than that, I love Pandora and love the ease that I can add it to my car, my tablets, phone, etc. Very user friendly."

43087,"Pandora",2016-02-12,5,"Favorite music app With all the music apps that I have downloaded and deleted from my phone, Pandora is the only one I have kept. If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I do not like a song, I simply hit thumbs down . If I like a song, I hit thumbs up and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I have never heard before. it is nice to shake things up sometimes."

43091,"Pandora",2017-05-31,4,"Music to drive by.... Finally followed advice to try this music site. Using free option for listening. Thought by choosing my singer it would be all their music but includes similar genre singers. Ok but not what I expected."
43100,"Pandora",2012-05-19,5,"great! this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too. this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip six times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying. some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people do not know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and artists that you do not like very well. this costs dollar forty a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora. I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
43102,"Pandora",2017-06-09,4,"Four Stars Somewhat difficult to navigate, especially if you are interested in concentrating on a single artist."

43115,"Pandora",2017-09-30,4,"LIFE= MUSIC I love listening to music throughout the day and Pandora is a great app for it. I have it on multiple devices, my phone, multiple tv's. I like that there is a great variety and you can choose the style that fits you or your mood even. I listen to my 90's alternative when relaxing with the hubby, country through out the day and my little secret lol, old school hip hop when I am alone and dancing in front of the mirror. do not act like you have never done it lol ! I do wish that you could skip as many songs as you wanted to on the free version tho and of course it goes without saying, I wish it were completely free but I am not complaining because it is a great app!"
43122,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"Wonderful I love Pandora because I can choose the music I want or do not want to listen to. I can take it with me when I go other places, and I now have it on my phone."
43124,"Pandora",2013-04-12,5,"best thing since sliced bread I bought me a blue tooth portable speaker soundfreq highly recommend it. Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq. Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone does not like the music i just type in what they like and there happy. I did have problems getting a specific song but it really did not matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version. Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."
43126,"Pandora",2013-01-15,4,"awesome music app great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone, iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/five stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of five or six Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"
43129,"Pandora",2016-12-06,4,"Its very very good! I love it an all but I have FULL INTERNET CONNECTION AND IT SAYS, Sorry waiting for connection Dang it!"
43130,"Pandora",2012-09-22,5,"Love the new update! this new update lets you view the lyrics and I love it! And they play the same ad over and over because that is who payed for it duh !"
43134,"Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Best streaming option. Absolutely the best source of music streaming. Not that there are not other good ones... Pandora is just a little above all of the others. Pandora gives you three choices of service level. I recently switched from some commercials to the lower of two commercial free options. All three are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this mid-level of service for some time to come. I really appreciate the ability to listen off line when there is no good streaming source available."
43135,"Pandora",2016-07-14,5,"I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite ... I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite artists and also the suggestions of artists that are similar to the ones that I selects which introduce me to new artists."
43137,"Pandora",2017-05-09,5,"I love pandora I absolutely love this APP. I downloaded right to my home screen so I have easy access to get to it faster . Great tutorials to teach you how to use this app and so much fun . i love all the genras of music to choose from.If this review has helped you in any way please check yes below<U+0085>. Many Thanks!I would recommend this product to friends and family."
43142,"Pandora",2016-06-30,5,"PANDORA What can I say this app rocks. No pun intended. Pandora has the capability to understand your music choices and with that they get your music preferences down and provide music that you will enjoy."
43147,"Pandora",2017-06-07,2,"Cancelled my paid subscription. I have been a Pandora One customer for four years. Today I cancelled my subscription. Why? Because they went from allowing two devices to stream at one time to just one device at a time. No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can not do that anymore. When I contacted them they did not seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account at a higher rate. I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I would paid for the last four years: dollar three and ninety nine one hundredths and the new account paying MORE at dollar 4.99. No thanks."
43148,"Pandora",2017-07-01,1,"Omg The app said it was trying to connect, when I had full bars. Why is it doing this?"
43151,"Pandora",2012-04-25,5,"Free Music! If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour although it is not unlimited.However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora One for a dollar four and ninety nine one hundredths monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive however, there is still a skip limit with Pandora One. There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for dollar 0.99. That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on for example, only on weekdays. It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a sleep timer that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval currently 15, 30, or sixty minutes so that the app does not play music all night while you sleep."
43155,"Pandora",2011-11-13,1,"Songs never finish I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I am very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
43157,"Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"I love this app I love this app! So easy to use! And free is always awesome!I love to have it playing all day. I love the mix that Pandora generates.I can listen to whatever style of music matches my mood that day!"
43159,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"love cause it has everything i want.i would reccomend to everyone.i have tried other ones and they play what i like."
43164,"Pandora",2017-09-15,5,"Fan for Years I have been a fan of Pandora for years with my computer, my phone, and now my tablet. I get to pick the music, even if we have to go back to the 1940s to get the songs and bands that play real music, not just noise."
43171,"Pandora",2016-03-30,5,"Best music app by far Best music app by far. Easy to create channels for all types of music genres and navigation back and forth between them. I eventually purchased the upgrade so that I did not have to deal with listening to ads between songs. I highly recommend taking that route if you plan on using this as your primary source for listening to music."
43173,"Pandora",2017-11-08,5,"I love it and use it daily on every device I ... do not know why this is here on Amazon, unless they are trying to compare Amazon Prime music with Pandora. OK, I have been a member/customer of Pandora for nine years, and once quit using because of too many ads, when they quit the distasteful number of ads on free I went back and next decided to go to Pandora-One and recently went even further to Pandora ultimate with no ads at all. I love it and use it daily on every device I own. I have no complaints. The music is clear and good EQ, perfect for headphones, all Bluetooth speakers and love the stories of the lives of artists."
43177,"Pandora",2016-03-06,4,"Is it worth it I will be honest Pandora is good at what it does. But it has gone down in quality with all the adds seeing as how every two or so songs I have to deal with four adds each time so yeah it is a good app but do you think it is worth paying or waiting through the adds."
43182,"Pandora",2017-06-12,4,"I love it! I have always loved Pandora. So its awesome to me. But sometimes it stops in the middle of nowhere. I am like Really . But I still love it and you should too."

43190,"Pandora",2017-06-18,5,"The original is still the best. Great streaming channel with a wide variety of music."
43194,"Pandora",2012-08-26,5,"Pandora - so much more evolved than listening to the radio! I love the Pandora app. I can customize it to play the type of music that I want to listen to. I can see the name of the songs and who is singing them complete unlike listening to the radio. No call letters of the radio station being blared at me every minute...just music. You can select whatever stations that you like and give a thumbs up rating to the songs you love to keep them playing when you want to hear them in the future."
43195,"Pandora",2012-12-26,5,"Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire I love love love Pandora and have used it for a few years now!! You can not get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now and not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
43197,"Pandora",2013-09-23,4,"NOT BAD AT ALL Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc. And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night. Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.Still, I do not expect to use it very much. I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music. But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment."
43198,"Pandora",2017-05-03,5,"Pandora is the absoute best for music listening! Love Pandora! Listen to it every day! Love that I can listen to different genre's of music depending on my mood."

43220,"Pandora",2017-05-20,5,"Love music Love the wide variety of music and options!"
43234,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"... long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up It did not take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear not what a local station thinks that I want to hear. The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, fourteen months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
43242,"Pandora",2016-06-09,5,"Music everywhere! I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials are not as bad as you find on the radio."

One good thing about Pandora is that the adds are not as bad they do not show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer"
43246,"Pandora",2016-05-31,5,"easy to use Same as the website, easy to use, my son 7yo has his music playing non-stop on his kindle at home.If my review was helpful, please hit yes !"
43249,"Pandora",2016-09-28,4,"Love music! I really like the variety of music. I have mine on shuffle so I will have a 60's song, then a country, then rock and roll! It is great, except of course the commercials, but there are like gobs of them!"
43253,"Pandora",2013-02-03,5,"A Godsend to Music Lovers! How long have I been listening to Pandora? Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that is how long ago I have been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over fifty two different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to five different Christmas stations which I am embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!. I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there is a wee box of arrows that you click so you can find out 1 Lyrics to most songs; 2 About the Artist; 3 WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing. You also have the ability to Bookmark any song that you like, so you do not have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember Who WAS that awesome artist? And, if you take the small effort to Thumb's Up/Down a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookmarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can not be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.And Yes! , I am a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? happy"
43257,"Pandora",2017-01-24,5,"Best site for music I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
43267,"Pandora",2017-07-22,4,"Great service Very cool. I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice. To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely."
43272,"Pandora",2013-05-20,4,"Great Music App I got this app years ago and loved it right away. This app tailors the music to your liking. Unlike other music apps this one is do not just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts. For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it will not just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper. The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs. You have to purchase it to be commercial free."
43273,"Pandora",2017-03-17,5,"Five Stars Great app"
43276,"Pandora",2013-12-16,5,"Pandora.... plays the best variety of songs that I like to listen to out there Love this app. Works great on a Droid X. We have paid the monthly fee so we do not get commercials<U+0085> That<U+0092>s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time. It has lots of features. Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to. Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much. Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool. Allows you to create as many stations as you like. If you do not like a song in your genre then thumb it down and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time."
43278,"Pandora",2016-06-29,4,"EASY MUSIC This app makes it easy to listen to music and I find it very helpful happy"
43279,"Pandora",2014-03-12,4,"Pandora Media I turn on Pandora from my Tablet and use a jambox for the sound via Bluetooth.. I am a subscriber and pay my monthly fee. Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart. Sometimes it is really bad. I have no problems with Radio Paradise. Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there. Most annoying since it is not December but March. It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars."
43280,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Five Stars Love to listen to it while cleaning."
43288,"Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes I have been using Pandora for about two years now and it is satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I am on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I am not sure if it is just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on highI have unlimited data, so it is not a problem for me. it is free so it is worth it but if you are thinking of getting Pandora OnePremium Membership that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it is a lot better in my opinion."
43289,"Pandora",2017-03-05,5,"Daily Music Choice I listen everyday via, TV, telephone or something. Good variety and will play your choices if you rate the songs."
43291,"Pandora",2016-10-24,3,"No difference I do not see a replay button. The new app looks exactly the same."
43295,"Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora amazes me, and I am a vinyl and radio junkie from way back. do not cheat yourself; try this one! Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it is commercial free if you pay the modest dollar thirty six and zero one hundredths US or so per year. Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you will get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose. I can not recommend Pandora highly enough. If you are tired of normal radio, try Pandora. you will listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love. it is almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go! Try it....I would be really surprised if you do not love it. You define your stations however you would like. Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
43298,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"great app I have been using Pandora for years and an always amazed by how will it chooses songs. I made a six hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song. The only reason I would not give it five stars is because you can not necessarily get the exact song you are looking for, you may have to wait a few songs for it to come up."
43302,"Pandora",2017-08-11,3,"Three Stars it is ok, too many ads"
43304,"Pandora",2014-07-23,4,"Not a bad app, very easy to use and install Not a bad app, very easy to use and install. I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top forty depending on my mood. This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical. Guess what? it is working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset."
43306,"Pandora",2014-05-27,5,"Free Radio Listen to PANDORA all the time, i will say sometimes the songs are repetitive, but that is why it is important to click the thumbs up or down button as you are presented songs you like and do not like. It will start to figure out what you like and give you more thumbs up type of music happy"
43308,"Pandora",2015-10-12,5,"best music app out there, get Pandora one! I have left several reviews for this most bad. These were while I was using the free version. Ads cause it to buffer forever. Music was choppy. Timeouts happened often. After upgrading to Pandora one it is like a whole different app! Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues do not usually stop the music. it is so much faster now it is amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that is not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!"
43312,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"A programable music station catering to what you want to hear! I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I did not know what to expect. I was surprised to find it easy to use and it is free. Not many bargains like this today. You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day. Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music. You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song. You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations. Share your stations with others also. what is not to like."
43314,"Pandora",2016-05-11,1,"Prepubescent creation at best! Do not expect Factual information I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I have come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that is not about that artist? confused That fact is beyond Sloppy it is entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? confused So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."
43318,"Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"*The* way to listen to music An excellent selection of music from all genres interrupted only occasionally by a single short commercial message."
43325,"Pandora",2017-08-02,5,"Easily select the songs you like to hear often I like Pandora when there is something specific I want to listen to and know I will hear the songs I like."
43326,"Pandora",2012-12-30,5,"Great! I love that you can choose what type of music or the artist you want to hear. It will play for a long time and just in case there are no interruptions, the app will ask if you are still listening. At which point, you can choose to keep listening or stop until the next time. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you are back to listening to your music preference. I recommend this app to all music lovers for anytime use!"
43327,"Pandora",2013-01-08,3,"The leader is falling behind When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely loved it. However, over time, the stations became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music ten hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced."
43330,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Pandora We love this!!! Select any music, set up multiple channels for your own person desires, set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike. Its one of the easiest things we have ever had and so much nicer than radio. No commercials, non-stop music, and just what you want to hear. You can not get better than that! I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio, every day of the week."

Pandora is probably going to be my new paid service. I can play and listen to pretty much everything I want too. Sirius has kind of become just like the free radio stations. If and when Howard Stern leaves I will probably get rid of my subscription but even then Howard seems like he is just phoning in his show so I am really thinking about cancelling my subscription with Sirius and going with Pandora."

However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora One for a dollar thirty six yearly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with no ads although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive however, there is still a skip limit with Pandora One. that is why I use Milk Music. You pay less only dollar four and zero one hundredths per month and you will get unlimited Skips with no Ads. I think I am going to say with Milk Music."

43413,"Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"The longer you have it the better it gets I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad one - was that six years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every six or seven songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the dollar four a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."

In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.I am not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me.

43534,"Pandora",2017-02-10,4,"Just downloaded this app and trying it for the first time do not know if its going to be good but my grandma had it for awhile and is able to download any music she wants so this might be better then any other music app I had. I just do not want to pay for anything lmao"
43540,"Pandora",2015-11-11,5,"Absolutely LOVE Pandora! Absolutely LOVE Pandora!! One of my absolute favorite ways to listen to music. You pick your song and it just seems to know what you want to listen to. it is super user friendly and spot on with my selections. Very pleased with this app. I have a Galaxy S6."
43545,"Pandora",2015-01-06,5,"highly recommend For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can not get enough of it. The ads do not really bug me. they are reasonable in length and I find them more tolerable than the raunchy television commercials."
43549,"Pandora",2014-11-13,5,"Pandora is justmy kind of listening. Pandora is perfect listening tuned to what I like in music. There is music for every genre that I can customize for whatever mood I am into for the moment. it is nice to be able to listen to music when you are away from home. You can bring a little comfort into a motel and relax and listen to music you like and it is always good.Pandora is a great station."
43556,"Pandora",2013-09-22,4,"Great way to hear new music! I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
43559,"Pandora",2017-10-20,5,"I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."
43562,"Pandora",2012-04-11,5,"Absolutely Fabulous! Absolutely Fabulous! I enjoy the quality of the music and my favorite artist from new age t trance and dance music."
43569,"Pandora",2014-02-14,5,"great app I love that I can type in a band that I love and it finds others similar for me! makes it alot easier to find music you enjoy and it has the thumbs up or down so that if you really like a song just hit the thumb up and it will play songs similar to its type and if you do not then it the thumbs down! You can add as many bands to the same radio channel as you want and it will shuffle all of those bands for you. I just love it!"
43570,"Pandora",2017-09-05,5,"I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it. Live in a rural community with few stations and few options.I selected my last phone because it plays Pandora so well."
43571,"Pandora",2014-06-14,3,"Music player I installed the app on my pc, phone and tablet at the same time. I checked to see if they were working by playing them. No way to turn the app off , you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing. I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on three devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!! Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices. A good little fix would be a stop button on the App. Oh by the way I am a paying customer!"
43575,"Pandora",2015-01-26,4,"like, not love I like pandora. It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations. Only problem: it can play really cool songs, and it can play really, really bad songs that you will not know why pandora thought you would like. Overall though, it is pretty cool."
43576,"Pandora",2017-05-09,5,"great I like this app cause it helps me sleep and i enjoy listing to the music that they provide me."
43580,"Pandora",2015-05-11,5,"radio Great for all your listening needs very limited commercials. .any type of music you can think of."
43582,"Pandora",2015-05-30,1,"stop wasting your time and go to spotify. Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! dollar four and ninety nine one hundredths a month!? it is barely worth a lifetime membership for dollar four and ninety nine one hundredths and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no are you sure screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership. Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click. It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on. I used to enjoy the free version but did not like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."
43583,"Pandora",2013-08-02,5,"Pandora App Awesome app. Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great. Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best. They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets. Far and away the best. I definitely recommend."
43584,"Pandora",2012-12-06,3,"Used to be very good! Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible. I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone. I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio. I have to say I am not jealous anymore. This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed: 1. Slacker 2. Iheart Radio 3. Pandora Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."
43585,"Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"I love, love I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
43590,"Pandora",2014-12-27,5,"Pandora is a great avenue for real music What we once had I am addicted to Pandora. It has a wonderful assortment of old time music. I love the Big Band, New Orleans Jazz, Boogie Woogie, 40's, 50's, as well as classical, classic Christmas was WONDERFUL, also old countryPatsy Cline and others. Pleasestay as great as you are. I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change."
43591,"Pandora",2014-02-13,5,"I like my Pandora This is a great app that you can configure to your style. You can thumbs up, or thumbs down songs to inform them of what music that you prefer. You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle.Hope that helps."
43599,"Pandora",2015-01-23,5,"Pandora is wonderful! Pandora is wonderful! I can listen to my favorite categories of music across multiple devices easily. The free service only has advertisements every twenty minutes - much better than other audio broadcast venues! If that is still too much, they offer a subscription service which eliminates all ads. Pretty cool!"
43611,"Pandora",2016-11-01,5,"Favorite Stations My favorite stations are Miles Davis and Nora Jones."
43612,"Pandora",2014-04-03,5,"My favorite music everywhere I go. I have unlimited minutes on my phone. I like to use Pandora to accompany me every where I go. I have several favorite stations and switch them to match my mood. One thing I really like is I can set a timer to turn it off whenever I want to use it to serenade me before I go to sleep. I can also wake to music if I so choose. I also use it on my computer but not as often as I do on my phone."
43614,"Pandora",2013-04-07,2,"it is ok This app only allows you to listen to music forty hours a month a some people like to listen to music a lot and it suck that it allows forty hours of listening to music it makes me feel like a kid like I am time on the amount of music I listen to"
43618,"Pandora",2016-10-20,5,"Five Stars Love pnor"
43619,"Pandora",2017-11-01,4,"Make it your own I am so very addicted to Pandora. I only sometimes wish there were a few more skips allowed, but still a great thing all around ! I recommend thumbprint radio !"
43621,"Pandora",2014-04-02,5,"Where can I find my jazz -Pandora I love jazz and cannot tolerate rap and hip hop. Pandora has every genre of music from country to opera. I listen to John Coltrane, Michael Buble and an ocassional Fleetwood Mac and Elton John if I feel like it. The ads are a little troublesome but I do not mind because I get to hear the channels I chose.If you do not want the ads you can upgrade to Pandora One for an extra few bucks."
43622,"Pandora",2017-09-26,3,"it is okay I do not really use pandora anymore,they play old music."
43623,"Pandora",2017-07-05,5,"Five Stars Great streaming music app!"

43651,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"pandora music app is great This app is NOW great! The first time I got this app I could not get it to workwell at all. I could get a few songs to play and then it froze up. All I had wasa blue Pandora screen. I deleted the app for three days. Today I loaded Pandora appagain. Now it works perfectly the way I want, alot of music that I love made upinto stations that I can play any time. Plays on my Kindle Fire HD in the back-ground as I do other web searches,etc. Wow this is great."
43656,"Pandora",2015-09-03,4,"A definite must if you like listening to music but limited number of songs. I love Pandora. I listen to lots of different music, especially latin salsa, bachata, merengue. I would give it a five except that in each venue, the list of music is limited. You keep hearing the same songs over and over. Pandora really needs to offer more songs."
43657,"Pandora",2014-03-07,4,"Enjoy Really like Pandora - have stored on smartphone - especially like custom stations Only problem when connected to car phone and using Bluetooth am unable to access what is playing and the indicate favorite or not unless disconnect from car radio - most difficult to do while driving which is why have in 1st place. Even ads are not disruptive but this lack of control cause to NOT rate a five"

43670,"Pandora",2014-10-08,3,"I like Pandora. Use it everyday I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."
43676,"Pandora",2016-11-21,4,"I love Pandora the music is great you can have more ... I love Pandora the music is great you can have more than one station. You have made this station affordable for people who can not afford to pay for a station thanks"
43678,"Pandora",2013-08-27,5,"All kinds of music Have used Pandora both on PC, Laptop and now Fire. Splendid sound from the Fire; just keeps me either relaxing or rock and roll while working in the home."
43679,"Pandora",2016-05-24,4,"Love the amount of songs available in all music genres Love the amount of songs available in all music genres.Hate that it takes forever to yea or nae your favorite songswhile setting up your favorite station."
43681,"Pandora",2017-08-10,1,"Play lists based on popularity rather than your personal taste. Pandora sucks. Set up a station based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can not stand guns and roses, ac-dc because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless."
43683,"Pandora",2013-12-29,4,"Pandora I do like it, but am having some trouble navigating it. For one thing I can not figure out how to turn it off without turning off the whole Kindle. I absolutely wish Amazon would include at least SOME instruction pamphlet with the Kindle other than how to turn it on, how to charge it and how to swipe. I do not have a smart phone or IPad, so have to really learn how to navigate this device, and it is not as easy as some would have you believe!"
43684,"Pandora",2016-03-25,3,"not a big fan in this day and age I do not really like some one or something choosing my music for me then turning off after inactivity hit me with comercials no thanks its Spotify for me"
43686,"Pandora",2016-08-01,5,"Love. I love Pandora and always have, it is never crashed on me and it does not take as much data as all of the other music streaming apps."
43687,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars thank you"
43690,"Pandora",2015-07-22,4,"Great App with an Annoying Flaw The app is fantastic. I love listening to music when I am driving or working; however, it is very buggy. I have yet to listen to the app for a solid hour without issues. Usually, it just needs restarted, so it is not a serious problem, but it does get annoying."
43695,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"Five Stars wonderful music"
43696,"Pandora",2015-01-07,1,"Good site, but app contains a virus! I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there is nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I will be looking for another app for my Kindle."
43697,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T!I!T!... GET IT!!! Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay dollar four for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and does not have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."
43706,"Pandora",2016-11-28,5,"Works great with Alexa Alexa calls this up on my Amazon Fire and connects with no difficulty. App works great and it is seamless."
43708,"Pandora",2013-10-18,4,"Wonderful as usual The new version of Pandora for Kindle Fire has many nice features like a sleep timer and an option to ask to temporarily not hear a tune you are tired of.I do wish it did not require so many steps to exit the application and the mini-items to click are difficult for my visually impaired husband to see.Otherwise it is as wonderful as ever. I definitely recommend the cheep annual subscription to avoid the commercials and have extended play for hours."
43711,"Pandora",2015-09-05,4,"Is a great music app Is a great music app, and I love that it has international artists as well. Just sometimes I do not really care so much for the selections chosen for you when you create a station around a certain artist, as sometimes I do not want to hear someone else."
43712,"Pandora",2016-12-09,5,"Great Music App I am really enjoying Pandora on my Samsung Galaxy. A lot of great music and very few commercials."
43713,"Pandora",2016-11-19,5,"Five Stars Love it"
43714,"Pandora",2013-03-26,5,"Love the variety of this app! Simply love this app. Am able to create stations based on my interests! I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia and Phantom, classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! does not matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD."
43715,"Pandora",2015-11-30,4,"Great music app! Pandora is a great way to listen to so many different genres of music. I really enjoy listening to a specific channel based on an artist and the other music that is mixed with it are very similar. Overall, it is a great app and I would certainly recommend it to my family and friends. The one thing I do not like is how it goes idle after a period of time. I suppose that is a way of saving battery power or something like that, so it is not too big of a problem."
43718,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"Five Stars I love Pandora, it is great to be able to listen to my favorite music at any time.I lo"
43720,"Pandora",2017-03-29,1,"Service Please Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. there is no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can not we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"
43724,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Works great. Works on my Kindle"
43727,"Pandora",2017-08-16,5,"Five Stars Very good."
43733,"Pandora",2015-01-14,5,"What I enjoy in the evening with dinner. I listen to Pandora daily when my wife and I are having dinner. I like the thumbs up or thumbs down feature because when I give it thumbs up I get more of that sort of music. When I give it a thumbs down the music goes off immediately. I also like the wide variety of music available."
43738,"Pandora",2016-09-03,5,"Just Great Music, Any Genre Pandora on my phone/tablet is perfect, pair the phone with blue tooth speaker at work or home, or blue tooth in car and no advertisements or DJs talking to cut into the music."
43744,"Pandora",2017-01-06,4,"often irritating play the same thing over and over, even on shuffle. play artists i do not like even when i have tons listed that i do like!"
43747,"Pandora",2016-07-16,3,"Goodbye Pandora music....I am now a Slacker! Pandora streaming is off-line and I have become a Slacker fan...Pandora streaming to multiple AV receivers has stopped for the past 30-days and Pandora is very slow to resolve this issue like past ones. Not able to listen to Pandora on such receivers so I now found Slacker Radio and use it via the iPod connection. Music selection with minimal 30-second commercials is free and finding better music selection/rotation than my paid Pandora music subscription. I have become a Slacker and goodbye to Pandora!"
43748,"Pandora",2017-09-06,4,"Easy to install and use on Echo Easy to install and use on Echo. Does not have every song I like so far but just started using it so still working on it."
43757,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Great music - few commercials! One of the best qualities about Pandora is that they play other music in the genre you have chosen, and this exposes the listener to music they might never have heard or been familiar with. The other bonus is being able to listen to a certain type of music on demand and then switch to totally different kind when the mood strikes. I have at least five options I choose from. Plus, my children can have their own stations when they are on the computer."
43761,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"Glitch? I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up not playing them they just pop-up and do not stop until I close the app. I do not know if it is just my kindle or the app."
43762,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Good for background music I have Pandora on my Kindle Fire and I use it as background music when I am entertaining so I do not have to figure out what music to play. So far I have only one station - cool jazz. I used the thumbs up, thumbs down option and I plan to do more with Pandora when I have more time. I am not sure if it is my Kindle or Pandora -- after the music has been playing for a while the screen goes black and I can not change anything any more. The music keeps playing for a while and eventually if you do not tell it anything it stops because it thinks you are not listening anymore."
43769,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"Love Pandora!!!! Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears. Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play. There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another although you will hear a ten or fifteen minute ad infrequently about Pandora. If a song comes on you do not like, just hit skip and it will never be played again. I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
43773,"Pandora",2017-08-04,4,"Four Stars I still love using Pandora, but I am growing tired of commercials and stoppages"
43774,"Pandora",2015-05-15,1,"make an account? Marketing an account is just stupid. I am not saying the app is stupid, but I do not want to make an account just for music. Five stars if this feature was not there."
43776,"Pandora",2016-07-12,4,"I listen to Pandora when I just need a good song to get me through the days events or ... I listen to Pandora when I just need a good song to get me through the days events or through a few work hard days at school to distress from all of that."
43778,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars Great"
43781,"Pandora",2013-12-27,5,"Amazing breadth of music. I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer. I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it would not take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up. Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound. I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour. I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to design a station."
43784,"Pandora",2014-04-01,5,"Superi-ear! it is free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it is free. Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can not do that on the radio and it is still free. I love Pandora. The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."
43786,"Pandora",2016-12-14,5,"Enjoy Pandora Pandora is fantastic. The music selection for each station is so enjoyable and creative. Listening to Pandora is loaded with pleasure."
43796,"Pandora",2017-08-06,5,"Five Stars Great!!!!"
43799,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Make your own stations. We love making our own stations - like Disney for the kids. This way, they can listen to all the music from their favorite movies. Plus, mom and dad can have a station too. As many as you want with different genres. We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV. it is a win-win when cleaning the house or just wanting some peaceful background music."
43805,"Pandora",2016-04-05,1,"BROKEN!!!! The last update broke it. I only get a blue screen with pandora in the center and seven and zero tenths in the lower right hand corner. After that it goes black sometimes locking up my Galaxy S5 phone."

43831,"Pandora",2015-11-06,5,"Free-Music-Streaming Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist.

43852,"Pandora",2013-03-17,2,"do not bother with phone app!!! Read below for a great desktop trick. Used to be the shizzle for the phone. Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream. WTF? And to boot, they are now asking you pay after forty hrs every month. I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc. forty hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their forty hr limit and endless ads. You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review. On the pc you do not experience the above issues however, there is still a lot of ads. UNLESS . . . you know a trick, like I do. And yes, it is completely legal.For your home pc, Google Adam Haile Elpis . Click on the first hit. Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora. In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora. Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things. 1- it allows you to have unlimited skips. 2- it will not download any ads. In other words, it simulates the pay service.you are WELCOME!!!"
43856,"Pandora",2013-04-03,4,"Bugs finally squashed Pandora has been with me since its inception and on a 3G connection on an iPhone it worked GREAT.When I took the plunge into the world of Android and 4G I had a problem with Pandora not wanting to work or was very sluggish between songs. It seems they have rectified that situation and all is good now. I can drive just about anywhere and have my music playing non-stop.A couple of things for them to think about. I would like to see the ads more geared towards the particular user that is listening to music... one that listens to 'nature' or 'classical' is a different creature than one that listens to 'rap', 'rock', 'pop', etc. Regional ads would be great too. I would love to know that my local convenience store that is just down the street is having a sale on some widget.All in all it was a rocky start and I went back to listening to other services for a while until Pandora got their act together and got an update out that fixed their problems. Since then... smooth sailing.Pandora ROCKS!"
43858,"Pandora",2012-06-19,5,"I LOVE Pandora, and use it daily! I have been using Pandora as a paid member, for years since before the 'app' came out. Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I am in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I am in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it is MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service happy"
43859,"Pandora",2016-12-15,3,"I do not see a whole lot of variety in the ... I do not see a whole lot of variety in the Trance and Techno genres meaning that as I listen for two hours to nearly twenty tracks, only five or six musical artists are played."
43862,"Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"Pandora is the best Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear. They will even find similar songs to match to your interest. I started with Johnny Cash, and before I knew it through their recommendations I had many songs by many artists that they play randomly for me. I love it. And, they are adding more regularly. You can not beat this service and best of all it is free."

And best of all it is free, you just have to listen to a few commercials but there are not that many. For some reason when I listen at work it times me out but when I am listening at home I do not get that."
43869,"Pandora",2011-11-07,5,"I LOVE PANDORA, and now I can have it on the go I love using pandpora and this app does the same thing. After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.lag time in between songs is usually pretty good not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection but overall not bad considering that I am driving through numerous cell towers as I am usually listening to Pandora. lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.Nice album art when its playing too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads and very easy to use command buttons."

This allows Pandora to find more songs that it thinks you will like and has given me back songs from my childhood, plus new favorites. Also, it allows you to listen to comediannes and then supplies you with others with the same type of humor, which allows you to discover new comics. THANK YOU!!"

It is easy to change around stations as well just by adding new artists to the starting list for that station. Great to have on as background for work."
43968,"Pandora",2013-08-03,4,"Almost perfect Very good app, but I wish they would allow for better mix of music like dj mixes. There are other app that give those options, like SoundCloud and FitRadio. it is a bit annoying to receive a message asking if I am still there listening, like I am supposed to be holding the phone at all times touching the menu buttons....stop it with the separation anxiety Pandora!!!"

44254,"Pandora",2017-04-28,4,"Got to love it My kind of music when i want it"
44262,"Pandora",2013-12-30,1,"FREE: HALF TRUE I loved the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount of listening hours. The amount was twenty hours. I was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you have ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. twenty hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait three one/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I do not have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered ten more hours...well that is an extra one/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again for free I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a five star rating but I remove one star for being deceitful, one star for putting a limit on an app that was free and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove one star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove one star for their lack of interest in working out a solution that would allow someone who had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I do not wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who do not use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year I remove one star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth one star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information. it is a shame we could not work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."

Then all of a sudden I could not access. It just seems like it is constantly in scan mode during the daytime hours. It returns a message that my station will be back in a minute. At night I can access. But that does not help me at work during the day. If I could access it more regularly, I would give it five stars cause I love the concept."

Can always build a better mouse trap and all that jazz. Havent had any problems with it just not playing lile other have said. Its also awesome in the fact that it will play even when you hit the sleep button on the kindle fire hd, so you dont have to burn that baterry so much to listen to music."
44424,"Pandora",2013-05-05,4,"Love! One of my favorite apps. Only negative things I can this of are that the thumbs down, and up are close by each other, so toddlers accidently press the wrong button. Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They are not as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."
44425,"Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"Best radio option Pandora does an excellent job of playing the music I like. It is better than a theme dedicated radio station because I can mix types of music, such as country and blues. I can take it anywhere on my kindle. Commercials are few and unobtrusive. Superior to subscription satellite radio, this is the best music option for me."
44426,"Pandora",2014-01-28,4,"Pandora is Great My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it is just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it. I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I do not like as well. The pop ups are annoying and I understand I am able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget. How about discounts for seniors???"
44427,"Pandora",2014-03-15,3,"A nice way to hear old favorites. I enjoy being able to find songs that are not played on the radio any more, and to focus on my favorite singers. The visual ads are not too annoying but the audio ones are."

44462,"Pandora",2014-06-24,3,"??? The music is good, the thing is easy to use, there are not too many radio interruptions, maybe three per hour.

Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like ninety eight and seven tenths and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can not pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and authorsput you can not pick the song. Pandora does not have station either, which I am thankful for."

44633,"Pandora",2013-10-25,3,"Great at Sticking to Genre but Too Many Commercials I have switched over to iTunes Radio for the most part but still use Pandora for the kids on the morning drive to school. Pandora does the best job at sticking to your specific genre selection kids, halloween, 4th of July than any other streaming service out there. Great job but too many commercials for me to use as my main streaming station."

44645,"Pandora",2012-11-29,3,"Update of Review - Kindle Fire HDX - 06/2014 Below, you will find my old review for how the App worked on my first gen Kindle Fire. With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.***Old Review 2012***This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. it is part of the reason why I do not subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they do not seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.Update Same day: So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I have changed the rating to reflect this.Another Update Same day: So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall will not fix this. I will reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!"
44649,"Pandora",2012-04-28,5,"Surprised by the low reviews I finally loaded the Pandora app the other day on advise from my daughter. After reading lots of bad an so - so reviews, I was skeptical, but did not think my college student would steer me wrong.I created a variety of stations among different genres and have beenvery happy with all my choices and most of Pandora's too. I haven't had to give many thumbs down. Even stations I have created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!The brief commercial breaks are not a problem at all.If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have."

44691,"Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Very happy It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around. I less frequently listen to my recorded music now. The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service. Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker. Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
44694,"Pandora",2013-08-15,3,"Pandora the app that used to be great I was introduced to Pandora by a friend and fell in love with it. I constantly listened to music on it. then one day I was cleaning my room and had been listening for a while then an artist that I do NOT like came on I tried to dislike it but the song continuedbto to play so I tried to skip it but I had already used the six skips in one hour the app is a great idea yet very expenseive and sucks battery I would have made this a five star review yet I just could not because if all the troubles I have had with this app."

EVERY song on there is incredible - takes me back many years and I can listen to it endlessly. Quality of the songs is excellent, and when compared to other music streaming apps such as Slacker Radio, Pandora is without peer."
44768,"Pandora",2014-06-09,5,"A Great Music App I love Pandora and have been using it for years on my laptop and iPhone. it is best feature for me is the ease of accessing such a wide variety of music from every era and from many artists sometimes new ones that I have not been familiar with. It is easy to use and was easy even when I was a new computer user many years ago. It updates with new features on a regular basis and the updates are always value added without big format changes."
44775,"Pandora",2013-09-07,5,"Loving the Blues It took a while for it to first start up but the app is working fine now, easy to navigate and of course; still the only downside are the ads, but that is because I am too cheap to get the paid version. XP"

44804,"Pandora",2014-08-20,4,"I love this free version I love this free version. Although, it may become worth it to get the monthly subscription so I do not have to listen to the ads."
44805,"Pandora",2014-05-20,3,"make the switch! Switch to Spotify! You can download fave songs to listen while on the road/etc. without burning up data!! Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive, ex. gives suggestions for different stations, singers, etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"
44809,"Pandora",2013-08-20,4,"choosing music I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to set up a station with my favorite artists! I am a country fan and while I enjoy all the different artists, I have ones that I really love and Pandora allows me to listen to them more often. I haven't explored all the options but am enjoying learning and listening. Thank you!"

44828,"Pandora",2014-10-29,1,"Such a let down. ..not the service...just the licenses. I can not believe they let me download this app when it is not even available in the UK. As soon as I opened it it has a warnine screen saying it is not available in the UK. And I LOVE Pandora do not get me wrong. But it was a big letdown after getting my hopes up that I would finally be able to get Pandora in the UK. Total bummer."
44831,"Pandora",2017-02-19,5,"Main Problem......now fixed! I really enjoy Pandora, daily, with all my favorite radio stations. I love the Shuffle feature! My biggest complaint is that it pops on at any time without clicking on it. This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD 8, which I have to Shut Down when I leave because Pandora may come on and use up all the battery. I do not sign out to end the music, only Quit because it is very difficult to sign in. I do not know if this is a Pandora problem or a Kindle problem.Update 4-16-17: After the recent Pandora update, this problem has finally been fixed! Much improvement with this last update, too."

No out-of-sync songs with my listening mood. My musical tastes are wide ranging but I hold high standards when it comes to listening to any genre. Pandora provides a way to get the best of the best. Gotta love that!"
44846,"Pandora",2014-12-27,2,"would like it is own app instead of going thru amazon app Not familiar enough with the phone yet, but 1. would like it is own app instead of going thru amazon app, 2. too many ad's, 3. too many suggested 'other' music I might like, 4. choosing other songs by an artist vs. just what they want to highlight, 5. Music does not stop when I turn off my phone, and 6. not easy or friendly or simple to navigate around the Amazon/Pandora app."
44847,"Pandora",2014-02-28,4,"Great for the Most Part You can not complain about the price, but I would like it so much better if you did not choose other artists for me, or if you would at least allow me to weed them out. The best I can do is drop one song at a time, and that just is not adequate. Most of the music you offer, however, is really great, so I gave you the four stars.Thank you."

44886,"Pandora",2012-09-25,5,"An Important App there is a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none Fix your device?This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can not be rid of an entire artist, only a song.From what I have experienced, this is an app that must be had."

I have not positively isolated the source of these ads. When I do that application will be deleted permanently and I may reload Pandora. I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT. I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it two stars.

They do not play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. they will play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I do not really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music...."

With it is astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections.

44948,"Pandora",2013-04-08,5,"Makes a noisy workplace less distracting I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me.

45027,"Pandora",2016-02-05,3,"music lover Its good so far wish i could play back my fav songs without going through all the radio stations, but i like the continuous play dont like tht they stop u from skipping"
45032,"Pandora",2015-09-13,5,"Enjoy! The app mirrors my smart phone and iPad apps which I thoroughly enjoy. Being able to customize the apply for my listening tastes is excellent. The free version does not have excessive advertisements. Enjoy! PS: Be mindful that the app uses data in the smart phone when used away from WiFi."
45035,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain I guess that is the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
45036,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Music to my ears I love listening to music without having to put in the CD or looking for the CD especially when I am trying to relax."
45040,"Pandora",2012-07-20,4,"Almost Perfect The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it is extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a three minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you are on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it is a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed."
45042,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"LOVING PANDORA! If you love music you should get PANDORA it is the bomb.

45059,"Pandora",2013-09-10,5,"Great Music Service Pandora has successfully made an app that oust all the other music/radio to shame. Only the quick advertisements take away from what is fluid and complety personal listening experience. On top of that Pandora continues to before better and better updates keeping the music fresh and the features applicable to what you look for on the app. Overall Pandora dwarfs all other radio apps."
45062,"Pandora",2016-08-24,1,"Not worth ad free cost for very limited repertoire in CHORALE. Lynn Music superior. Very limited repertoire in each category of music, especially CHORALE.

45068,"Pandora",2012-08-02,4,"I am in love BUT Ok I am fifty one and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me. Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire. I love it. I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist. And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again. It remembers. The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder. The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing. Sometimes I do not want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc. I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."

The music comes in a variety of genres most of which I haven't had time to explore. You can save favorite tracks, search by artist, track or song. I still need to spend more time learning how to use it. But I am very pleased so far."
45142,"Pandora",2013-08-30,5,"STUPENDOUS!!! Pandora is to die for!!!! I have never loved any music service as much as I love Pandora. I have extremely eclectic tastes in music and there is always something I can find on Pandora to suit my mood. Kudos to Pandora for being so intelligent. Their info pages are great. Keep up the good work!"
45147,"Pandora",2011-12-08,2,"Not Available in Panama I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire. The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio. To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.As you can imagine, I am not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face. Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.Omar Upegui R.Panama, Republic of PanamaCentral America"
45148,"Pandora",2012-01-13,4,"Pandora fan for years now I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it is great.Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about twenty seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they have gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."
45151,"Pandora",2015-03-22,5,"Eyeintheskky Love the the vatriety of music. The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you do not like. Great way to match music to individual tastes. Kudos Pandora!"
45154,"Pandora",2013-07-13,5,"Efficient control over what you listen to What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel. You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy. Lots of programs can play one group over and over. Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."

With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home. The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends. We are home."

45171,"Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"My 3rd most used App. I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every ten minutes."

Also I do not like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"

45189,"Pandora",2013-10-30,2,"Annoying, Incessant Ads and Continual Upgrade Harassment Free is a relative term. What price is free dom? In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every two seconds. The curse, if you do not upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they would only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the twond star. We each have different patience levels. You have to decide what you are willing to put up with ad-wise for the free app. Just know what you are getting into."

One of the primary reasons why I like it so much is that I have some control over what I may want to listen to. Definitely two thumbs up."
45361,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Loved having it on while I worked! It came through just like from my computer, phone or TV. I love using it on my fire because it does not use data like my phone."

45369,"Pandora",2015-11-20,5,"The best! I am listening to Pandora right now. As a matter of fact, I listen to it the entire time I am working on my computer. I love that I get to make up my own radio stations and put on whichever station I feel like listening to."
45372,"Pandora",2013-10-09,5,"Rock on!! I have Pandora on my phone, Pandora on my Pc and now Pandora on my Kindle Fire Hd. Does that say anything for this app? It is my fav music app. My kids can listen to the tween station, my man can listen to the Regional Mexicana station and I can rock it out!! So, yes this is an awesome app!!"

45383,"Pandora",2012-05-08,3,"could be better.... Panodora is a really great app and plays po the music I want, but my advice to you would be not to like the songs you like, because it takes it seriously plays that song over and over again. I promise that if you listen to the song area times it will recognize that you like it and play it more frequently. It never plays the songs that you dislike ,though, and that is always a good thing happy"
45384,"Pandora",2017-02-07,5,"Five Stars it is Pandora"
45392,"Pandora",2015-07-21,5,"a great app! every thing works a great app! every thing works for free but you can upgrade and get another feature that gives u the unlimited availably to skip songs u do not want to hear. The free version only allows you to skip four or five per session."
45393,"Pandora",2013-05-09,5,"Awesome! This app is amazing!!! I could not ask for better, why download costly songs when you can download a free app to listen to all your favorite songs without pay. that is pretty cool. The only bad thing is that you need Internet connection to use, and some of the songs are innapropriate. But otherwise...I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP :"
45395,"Pandora",2017-08-01,4,"then I would love this app If Pandora did not have so many commercials, then I would love this app. But, Amazon Music is love for me. happy"

45399,"Pandora",2013-06-17,5,"Pandora Pandora is the greatest invention since FM radio. Rather than choosing a station based on what kind of music you like you now choose an artist you are in the mood to listen to and it never fails to satisfy. I love 80's hair bands for working out, jack Johnson for cooking, Chris daughtry for working and Abba by the pool."
45401,"Pandora",2015-06-19,5,"Awesome This app enables me to listen to whatever I want to it rocks whoever does not like it is totally missing out on the fun it brings you on Friday night party's and random gigs!!"
45405,"Pandora",2012-04-15,4,"SO WORTH IT this app is amazing! especially considering that it is free! I never have to buy music, I just make different channels, that I can adjust to my liking, and have playlists of songs that fit every mood. The occasional commercial, around one every fifteen songs does not bother me, WHO CARES IT WAS FREE!!!!! ive never had problems with loading on my kindle fire or laptop. GET THIS APP!!! five stars."
45411,"Pandora",2016-12-28,4,"does what it should I do not subscribe/pay for Pandora, so I listen to the version with ads. It works well, but can be a little glitchy when used on my phone."
45412,"Pandora",2013-08-15,4,"Its A Very Good App For People That Love Music! The Only Thing That I Dislike About Pandora is that you can only change the so I Love Pandora! Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great! I Would Rate It Four Stars Instead Of Five Just Because Of The Issue With Skipping The Track Only Six Times."
45414,"Pandora",2012-05-18,1,"FAIL! I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I am lucky if I hear more than thirty seconds. I gave Pandora the benefit of the doubt and waited until the latest update... but still the same thing. I am uninstalling. Pandora has lost another customer."

45432,"Pandora",2013-06-13,5,"Its good times...whar more can you say! As a past subscriber to XM Radio I was looking for a substitute for less cost. XM is just too much money unless you travel alot. Pandora fills the spot nicely. Its good on travel too if you have good internet service in your area of travel. I have not tried their premium service, but I am thinking about it."
45433,"Pandora",2015-02-11,5,"Pandora Forever I LOVVVEE pandora with such a wide selection and so many genres why would I turn on the radio? But sometimes I do get stuck listening to the same songs but its easily fixed with a new station."

45441,"Pandora",2012-12-16,5,"LOVE THIS APP Pandora is great. It can create numerous stations of music to your selection. Such as pop/rock/Christmas/country etc. You can also search by artist ot songs.If your not the greatest at finding songs you like Pandora can surely help. The only thing I do not like about this app is that it requires wi-fi. Other than that it is a five star app!"
45444,"Pandora",2014-07-23,5,"Love it! It is a great way to listen to music.It lets you create stations and like or dislike any songs.The only problem is that when you dislike or try to skip a song at the wrong time you get a annoying pop up that you have to respond to."
45447,"Pandora",2012-08-13,4,"Too many adds There are way too many adds. Once in a while an add will come up saying Why adds and then explains. ten times or more in a song you have too close out a mini add and if you miss the x it will take you to the company's website. So annoying!It has a nice variety of songs on each channel that goes along with the genre of music you are listening to."

45457,"Pandora",2012-02-21,4,"stop complaining people are saying that Pandora is declining, but i haven't experienced any problems that everyone is complaining about. my only issue is the commercials and they only come on like once an hour. the songs never stop randomly and pandoda is still working fine fkr me. if you are having a problem with Pandora, either suck it up and deal with it or use something else like iHeartRadio."

45479,"Pandora",2016-07-11,1,"screw pandora too many ads, and the company is way to political. Screw you pandora."
45481,"Pandora",2016-12-30,4,"it is Alright The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I am listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I do not think you should not get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem."
45483,"Pandora",2014-09-12,5,"Definitely improved! Originally, when I reviewed Pandora I gave it one star due to too many commercials. Since I have gotten my Echo I noticed that problem has greatly improved! Pandora listened and now the commercials are manageable."
45485,"Pandora",2012-08-25,5,"Gr8 App! Pandora is such a great app on KF, been using it for awhile now it is really outstanding how selective playlists can be organized for your pleasure. Only complaint is when are you pushing their latest update on Amazon app store, it is available now on Google play do not know why Amazon takes ages for updates on Android apps which are already out."
45486,"Pandora",2016-07-15,4,"Review The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's."
45487,"Pandora",2013-06-24,2,"its bad its ok but if u type in the song you want to hear you wont even get to hear it. plus if you type in the artist you willnget other artists not even in the same genre. I reccomend the app tune In although you cant listen to the song you want you can listen to radio stations worldwide plus its free"
45497,"Pandora",2012-03-30,4,"Love it happy I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I do not like a song, just put thumbs down. But it is kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials happy"
45503,"Pandora",2013-04-04,5,"MUSIC! I love having music and a variety of it. I do not buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or did not know who did them."
45504,"Pandora",2016-04-25,5,"Great! Works like the Pandora on my phone! I downloaded it, fired up my smoker, and listened to Blues music while smoking dinner and drinking Tennessee Whiskey."

45518,"Pandora",2012-12-04,1,"Pandora's broken I really used to love this app but recent updates have made my kindle fire unstable and the ads have been regularly crashing the app. Also, the ads have become more frequent. I could probably deal with if they worked properly and music would resume after they finished. Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend this app."
45520,"Pandora",2014-04-18,5,"cool I love Pandora it gives me a lot of variety. of course there are some advertisements but not so many that you cannot enjoy the music.would recommend"

Now it freezes up my Kindle Fire every few song and that makes it virtually unusable. It will remain a one star until they fix the 'improvements'."
45567,"Pandora",2013-12-17,3,"Pretty good most the time On my kindle fire it skips the last half of the song a lot and pauses randomly, its not that I have bad internet connection because I had all bars. Glitch of some sort but other than that it plays music by the same artist and artists like it."

45593,"Pandora",2011-12-21,5,"Love my Pandora! Interesting that this free radio is called pandora . . . . It is a box full of music of every genre you can imagine. I have Pandora on my home and work computers, my android phone, and now my Kindle Fire!

So I would so its a ok app!!!"
45628,"Pandora",2015-03-18,3,"Why? I would give this five stars but if I type in the name of a song it would be nice to hear that song or at least songs by the same musicians."
45631,"Pandora",2012-01-31,5,"awesome on kindle fire this app loads nicely and is very easy to navigate. it is great to listen to music while reading to drown out distracting noises like the tv. create multiple artist or group radio stations and enjoy the music. it even has a shuffle function. the ads are short and far in between so not a nuisance at all. love, love, love this app."

There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up."
45674,"Pandora",2013-08-17,4,"ok This is a great app. But, it would be even better if you could keep listening to the same song over and over again. That is why I just gave it four stars. Sometimes it does not work, though. Otherwise it is the best music app in my opinion."

45775,"Pandora",2015-04-10,5,"Love it Pandora is fabulous. You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music. It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time."

45810,"Pandora",2011-12-05,3,"permissions Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application- tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates. I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information, or why it has to be pinged so frequently. I understand that they need general location data for advertisements, but up to the minute is completely unnecessary. What is this company up to?"

45871,"Pandora",2014-03-30,5,"One of the best apps ever. I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy.

45886,"Pandora",2011-10-24,3,"song choices are great. Ads played over the songs are not I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying. The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense. Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background."
45889,"Pandora",2013-01-04,3,"I guess I was expecting something more I entered that I wanted to hear Lady Gaga. I heard one Lady Gaga song and the rest were songs from all the pop princesses like Brittney Spears, Katy Perry, etc. Then I entered I wanted to hear Little Big Town. Once again, I heard two Little Big Town songs, and rest of the songs were just numerous other country singers, that I do not really care to hear. I am a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting to hear only the singers I requested."

45913,"Pandora",2013-07-23,5,"Excellent music alternative No commercials just music tailored to your own tastes. It also provides tracks that are similar to your own favorites. The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you do not rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening. A small price to pay."

45958,"Pandora",2012-02-27,2,"What a Shame I used to enjoy this app because it gave me a variety of music from the designated artist, genre, or composer. Soon, it started playing music that was not even related to the station. It is quite disappointing on Pandora's account."
45959,"Pandora",2013-12-28,3,"it is OK but gets boring very quickly. Adds will drive you insane. If I choose an artist for the play list, you are lucky if you will hear that band play at all or maybe one or two times in an hour. Seems to always be the same songs played most times. I guess that is what you get for the free Pandora. Lots of adds and commercials Sometimes it is easier to just put my radio on and switch stations as I go along. However, paid Pandora might be the alternative in order to see if it is still worth it or not."

46038,"Pandora",2011-11-17,1,"it is not as customizable as one might think... For something that touts itself as internet radio, it is customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to one song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you have likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, look elsewhere. This is not going to give you many real options for customizing your personal station .Signed, Pamela T."
46040,"Pandora",2012-03-19,5,"great as always this app is amazing, if you complain about ads, get over it and pay. they have to make money some way if no one buys it. imagine if you did not get paid at your job. this app is the best music app out there and either learn to love it or gtfo."

I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."

As a heavy metal fan some of the bands I like are less popular but I can find them all here. I am amazed some local and lesser known bands are featured on this service. It makes me glad that the ad revenue goes to supporting them in making more great music for my enjoyment."

If I could have found those it would have been five stars. it is very user friendly and I love that it let us me get entire albums at one time or pick and choose individual songs. Definitely recommend this app for music lovers."
47541,"Spotify",2016-11-03,5,"BETTER THAN IHEARTRADIO AND PANDORA BOTH!!!! it is free. Commercial ever thirty minutes, and they have every stone by EVERY artist. Easy to navigate and create your own playlist too. Wish I found this two years ago!!"
47542,"Spotify",2016-05-31,4,"it is worth getting Spotify is worth getting, it does take a while to set up a playlist, but I do have to recommend Pandora to find new artists then deffinetly get spotify so you do not get random songs you do not want to hear."

47550,"Spotify",2015-11-16,4,"Great This app is pretty great let us you listen to any music you want. But it also plays songs that arn't on your Playlist but in the same genre. If you get the whole pack thing that you have to pay for monthly then they only play the songs on your playlist."

47552,"Spotify",2015-02-12,5,"Great app, but needs one feature Really great app, add your own specific music, listen to stations by the the artist or songs like pandora but smarter, and download music from spotify with a premium account. But one feature is that I wish you could pay for premium via amazom store, like a subscription. Other than that, its an awesome app for music."

I can put on my happy playlist when I am happy, for example, and it sets the environment so perfectly. And it has all the classical music I need for when I am studying! If I want something specific, Spotify is my go-to app"
47558,"Spotify",2016-08-15,5,"Awesome This app has all of the songs you like and that you know"
47565,"Spotify",2014-10-26,3,"Okay, I guess... Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can not play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."
47566,"Spotify",2016-11-07,5,"Very good! I think this app is amazing. Its free, with only occasional ads, usually giving periods of ad free music. The app is also easy to use, and has many songs to enjoy."

I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash think of that what you may because I just went to em<f8>ti<f8>nal r<f8>ad sh<f8>w yesterday June 18, 2016 so hehe. But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you do not have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you are listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they will not play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic. I am awkward just get the app."

47876,"Spotify",2016-01-12,4,"Awesome Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can not play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it is the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc."

48080,"Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"The only reason for four stars The only reason I did not give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song."
48087,"Spotify",2015-09-23,3,"Glorified Pandora Used to be really great before they switched it to where only premium members get to pick songs. Now with the skip limits and the only allowing shuffle play, it might as well be just like Pandora. Only Pandora has less ads."

Also, on the web I do not have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It was not really specified as to why I should not have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app. Another issue is that I can not find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it is viable through high-speed internet. The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users."

49891,"Spotify",2016-01-12,5,"Love It!!!! I think this is a great all-around app, although its really easy to hide what you listen to. Only bad thing about this app."
49894,"Spotify",2014-11-03,5,"I Love Both the Service and the App I love music of every genre, from the Jesus Music heydays in the 1970s and 80s to classical to American blues. Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I do not remember why, but it made sense at the time.So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs in general. I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended. I will live. I am happy I have this.Anthony Trendlanthonytrendl.com"

49935,"Spotify",2014-12-30,3,"Because I love Spotify. it is essentially all I listen to when ... Mixed feeling about this one. Because I love Spotify. it is essentially all I listen to when I am at the desktop so putting it on my tablet seemed a no-brainer. And when it worked it was great. The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small Less than seventeen songs?, it would start throwing in random songs, as though you would created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I will make a playlist with a single song because, well, that is how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the suggested songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there was not enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it is still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market."

52365,"Spotify",2015-09-09,3,"MUST READ IF ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD! If you want to get this app, there are a few important things to know:1.The last I checked, they do not have Taylor Swift songs, so I am really sorry for all those Taylor Swift fans out there! I was also disappointed with that.2. You can not play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can not just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET!3. They do not have all songs, but they do have most.4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY!5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like thatTHANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I am sorry Taylor Swift fans, I do not think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it is a money /business issue. -thank you-"

You can get everything from the original, to remixes, to the live versions of a ton of songs. I have everything from 1D to for King and Country! I love Spotify and think it is epic! Once I got my Spotify, I quit Pandora and eventually deleted the app. Spotify is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting it!!!"

53005,"Spotify",2015-12-06,4,"Great. Ehh. Resentment.... I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I would be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user I ran into the same skip limit as if I did not shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I would start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day I Guess This Is What We Call Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 1eight2, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's and 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. that is what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly twenty Playlists with over one thousand seven hundred songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that is how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up four and five tenths GBs of the allotted six and three tenths GBs. There were not enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX eight eight GB and purchased the thirty two GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY thirty two GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that is just based off the experiences I have read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let us say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX eight I probably would have gotten a bigger Kindle external memory wise. What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX eight eight GB start off with a mere five and three tenths GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. coughs Pandora coughs. In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX eight. You can not really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it is only dollar 12.99/month. what is that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I will pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it is features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can not go wrong."

53106,"Spotify",2016-01-10,4,"Nice app, but could use some upgrades. I subscribe to Spotify premium and I got this app for our Fire TV stick. It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works, but I do not like that I need to use a 2nd device to change the songs, etc. Also, sometimes the connection is not stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it is ok, but I think app could use some work.I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review!"

I can find music by mood or era, and discover gems I would have never come across by just a simple search. The feature of following other members' extensive playlists is a great way to reconnect with music that has been forgotten over the years.

55867,"Spotify",2014-10-23,5,"this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ... Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists. Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick. If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you. If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists. Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc. I recommend the paid version If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"

56512,"Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People do not understand this amazing app. This app is simply amazing. it is musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a station or mix and that feature is decent. The algorithms are not great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that do not want to pay for premium service, you do not have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I am aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you do not need to pay dollar nine and ninety nine one hundredths monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they do not email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I have had my account for five months and I do not think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. happy"

57473,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"Not Worth It I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can not choose what song you want to listen to it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can not exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can not see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it is a song you do not like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you do not throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

57553,"Spotify",2015-10-09,3,"Okay The app is a great app, my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music. It has not been like this, and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating changes. I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to, I hate this shuffle play because it will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album, and it gets on my nerves. When I want to listen to and number 34;Freak and number 34; or and number 34;Honeymoon and number 34; by Lana Del Rey, I have to hear other songs of her with remixes that ruin her beautiful songs. It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade, it does not me me. Soo, Spotify does not want me to be happy. Most of the Music apps are on Kit Kat four and one tenths Android and iOS 7-9 Apple and I have a Kindle."

So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and do not put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes"

57645,"Spotify",2015-09-18,5,"spotify is the best With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover or rediscover all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can not really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it is not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

I was very shocked with the songs I did download whom did not display an explicit tag, but once played there were curse words throughout the song.

58307,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best Music App Out There For Streams! Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it is important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music, you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you are a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.I highly recommend to anyone who does not already have Spotify. it is my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I have been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.I would also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?I think so!"

58464,"Spotify",2016-02-18,5,"Spotify is the only way to listen to music I love Spotify! It is the gateway to all things music. You are able to listen to all you favorites, make playlists, and brows music you would have never found without Spotify. I like to use the menu on a song to start a radio station around that song, then use the thumbs up or thumbs down to personalize the sounds I like. I love being able to download certain songs/playlist/ albums in order to use the offline mode that does not take any data from my limited plan. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants all your music in one place."

With spotify you can create playlists of songs YOU want to hear! And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

Btw... if and when u do get the app, it might ask if u want to start a free seven day trial to listen to songs anywhere, anytime... this trial is truly free and does goes through all seven days. U DO need Wi-Fi for the app to work.. but when u are connected it works perfectly. I would give this app one hundred or more if possible anyways...all in all.... this app is amazing for anything. that is why I give this five stars."

Keep your Pandora for hands free listening, Try Spotify to share Music files, or creating Videos."

58779,"Spotify",2015-09-10,2,"New Update This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can not take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can not play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song usually not the one I want and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it is just a crappy update."
58780,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"AMAZING but..... Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it is either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I am worried it will use up my data too. Besides that, it is pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist for free with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!"
58783,"Spotify",2015-12-20,3,"its okay I said I s okay because at first when I got I was so happy because now I could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so I downloaded it to my iPhone but when I clicked a song it would play another song and I found that very anoyoing and once I was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and I tryed to quickly turn it of however when I use spotifiy on my iPad it always plays the song that I want to hear it always plays that song but then there is an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now I do not know if its my only my iPhone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying"
58791,"Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"Best Music Streaming Service! Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to! from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you are able to listen to your music - commercial free."

58794,"Spotify",2015-10-31,2,"Take off the Restrictions on Skips I used to love Spotify so much. It was basically the best and probably one of the most used music app. Lately I noticed that there have been a lot of updates of the app. Now who would not love New updates to one of their favorite app?Now I can not skip songs more than five times in a row, if I want to I have to upgrade to premium. I guess a lot of people are not upgrading to premium, so now they are making less and less features of the app available for free. Now I do not mind listening to ads, and trust me they do play along of ads back to back after listening to about five-6 songs."

58799,"Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Stream vs Storage. I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they did not have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to dollar one and twenty nine one hundredths adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I do not need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I could not find something on Spotify. I would not be surprised if you could not find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it is made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
58803,"Spotify",2016-03-07,5,"Let There Be Rock! Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse and worse until the point of being unbearable when it would not even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement and came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues and they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
58808,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"Change it back!!! I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only and number 34;premium subscribers and number 34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! do not tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."

I am a premium member and love this app. I have several playlist and music is my life so I am always streaming my music and listening to it. I like a lot of Genres of music and this app is perfect for me, it fits my needs. I like that you can just listen to the artist unlike there competitor Pandora which only plays artist similar to the one you picked, Also I like the Offline mode when you are a Premium member, where you can download a song or album and listen to it at anytime even if you have no internet connection like on an airplane in airplane mode."
58831,"Spotify",2016-11-22,5,"Well Worth the Price I love using Spotify. I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith. I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly. Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips."
58832,"Spotify",2016-09-26,5,"Best music app and program ever This app is awesome! I have been looking for a app that plays songs while I play games etc. Thank you so much!"
58833,"Spotify",2017-04-29,5,"Sweet Little Music App Great stations. Great variety! LOVE this app!"
58834,"Spotify",2015-01-09,2,"Try something else Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. ninety percent of the time, I use Spotify when I am out and can not access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. it is less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something."
58841,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"Game changer for music lovers My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than one can listen at a time without commercials"
58849,"Spotify",2016-01-09,5,"premium is worth the dollar We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem! However, you can not set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid dollar five more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
58850,"Spotify",2015-03-03,3,"Spotify App has Limitations I love Spotify. I will say that right now. I have it on my iMac, my iPad, and on my kindle, and I do not even pay for premium. I am, however, very disappointed with the kindle spotify app. I can still make playlists and listen to radio, but I have a limited number of skips and it never plays the song I want it to. It shuffles and suggests songs constantly and also plays songs over again. What I do not understand it why I have these limitations on my kindle but not on my iPad or iMac. Is Apple so superior that I can not have the same update on my kindle??"
58852,"Spotify",2017-02-16,5,"LOVE Spotify! Wonderful app--better than Google Play or Pandora. It gives me a lot more listening options. I can select the artists or songs I want."
58857,"Spotify",2014-06-24,4,"Super Love it!!! Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it. Have suggested it to a couple friends that did not know about it."
58871,"Spotify",2017-01-14,5,"A boon to music appreciation and musicianship. I have found songs I thought I would never find again. I even discovered a new favorite tune that if not for Spotify would not have. Spotify is a revolutionary development to today's music lover."
58874,"Spotify",2017-02-19,5,"Oh yes, wonderful! Play while playing or working on your tablet etc. The beauty that is the music via Spotify is right here."
58876,"Spotify",2015-09-25,3,"Love spotify, but app needs work The app regularity and number 34;skips and number 34;, similar to like what would happen if you bump a CD player. It does not cause the app to lock up or anything, but is annoying none the less. This happens in offline mode so it is not caused by an unreliable network connection. This is on a fire phone."
58878,"Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"I always use this app! I was looking for good music apps and I do not really like pandora...it does not have enough skips and u do not know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this ten stars if I could!"
58881,"Spotify",2016-05-03,5,"If I Could Give It a Perfect ten I Would I was reluctant to try this ironically enough because it is free and I figured the whole you get what you pay for adage is an adage for a reason. When Beats Music got bought out I figured I would give Spotify a go before signing up with another subscription service. it is the best decision I have made in a long time."
58883,"Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"assuming you are not into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they do not have it is Spotify....nothing to complain about, assuming you are not into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they do not have.No tricksy hobbitses to be found here, you just drop a dollar ten every month and you get unlimited access to basically every song out there to download and play whenever. Shuffle is pretty meh it definitely does not cycle through your whole list like it should but I really can not complain about the six hundred songs I have gotten for pocket change."
58885,"Spotify",2016-10-12,4,"Great!! This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome."
58887,"Spotify",2017-04-19,5,"Better than Pandora Spotify let us you listen to songs that you want to listen to! If you are a music person you need Spotify."
58899,"Spotify",2016-10-01,5,"To all music bow downers... Love Love LOVE THIS APP !!! All the had music you. Could ask for ... As a music Lover the greatest music app I have ever tried!

58970,"Spotify",2016-12-15,5,"Perfect The best music library of any service. Music discovery is very robust, either by searching popular songs by artists or by the Spotify curated playlists."
58972,"Spotify",2015-09-23,1,"worst update Ever since the new update it has disabled you to turn off shuffle. It it gives you ads that are more consistent than before. The app restricts your ability of listening to your music when you want and what you want to play. Overall it has given more ads limited the amounts of skips and only allows you to shuffle play which may play songs that do not fit your mood."

And it probably always will...it is probably because you are trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a one hundred year old man, and passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I do not use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist online or off has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, and always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit Home before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it and selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you are also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"

I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option. The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built. Enjoy. Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success."

I hate this app because though it has a lot of music, it does not allow for more than a few skips of disliked songs AND if I do not have enough songs on a playlist like more than five or six, it forcefully adds MORE from other artists it THINKS are similar onto MY playlist.

So for the first few hours Spotify worked, then as I am trying listen to my favorite song it will not play and it will pause on it is own. what is bazzare is that I have a lot of Falling in Reverse and it will not play one single song by the band, but it will work fine on any other song. So basically do not buy the app if you reading this review."

Now I understand that a mobile version of the website is going to necessarily be less flexible than the site. I get that. But why I am limited to shuffle play, I do not understand. Surely that is not a huge memory issue?Here's the thing, I am a writer.. I put together playlists for each piece I work on and listen to them as I write. I take a lot of time deciding what the right flow is on my playlists, and hearing them shuffled kind of defeats the whole process. Yeah, I find it irritating and it is pretty much put paid to the idea of using Spotify on my phone or tablet unless I am just going to do some random listening."

Then they added another ad the most annoying being for Spotify and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but could not and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes, I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move, Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems, true, but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app."

Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past.

I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime as long as I have a WiFi connection and I am glad the music continues to play when the screen is off I use the app on a FireHDI do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time it is most likely to happen while I am on the web the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. Which, btw, counts as a and number 34;skip and number 34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"

Other than purely local bands and even some of them are here, Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love. It has way more than other subscription services I have tried. The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another. I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I am listening to to a playlist, I will not find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device. I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who do not mind commercials Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it is just more convenient. I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly works for major commercial artists, but that is not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs? When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

60037,"Spotify",2017-02-28,4,"Great, but takes up too much space too fast I absolutely love this app. I have tried many others and in my opinion, this is the best. The only problem iis that it takes up too much space in so little songs. If there is a way to fix that, I would love it. Thank you for an otherwise great app."

60050,"Spotify",2015-11-09,1,"they changed the app Originally I loved the app, I could look up songs and listen to them to make sure I found the right version I was looking for, now when I search a song I can not listen to it at all until I add it to my play list and then I have to wait since the app only allows songs to be played in shuffle mode. I liked it much better when I could listen to the songs when I wanted to. I understand with a free app I should expect ads, I do not have a problem with that, but this shuffle mode and not being able to hear a song sample makes this app terrible. I will be looking for a new way to listen to my favorite songs."
60054,"Spotify",2017-03-07,3,"In do not know if anyone will see this but.... This app is half good and half bad,the good part about it is,it is music and its free,but its also bad because it wants you to buy premium for dollar nine and zero one hundredths or more,which some people dont have meso if you have the money than good,you will like the app,but if you do not have the money than,I do not recommend getting it"
60067,"Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect gift for my grandson! He seemed disappointed at first, only downloading the app on his cellular phone, but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots, and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots, as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."

60070,"Spotify",2016-11-03,5,"Rock-solid fan Anybody who loves music has to have Spotify. This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe. I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle. A seemingly endless supply of music. I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for. I am not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there is not."
60075,"Spotify",2015-11-05,4,"Eureka! Where have you been all my life? I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the Discover function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past and my past is pretty extensive. Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again and they are repetitious, but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"
60076,"Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"omg it is the best and nothing else is It works well on a tablet so get it it may ask you for a email"
60077,"Spotify",2016-02-08,4,"Almost got it. So close. Mostly perfect. Very manual transmission in design. For some, this is a great thing. You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save. I am ambiguous on what follow -ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants, all this freedom can seem horrifying, It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own. This could be frustrating if it is not considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track that the service is aware of to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things while the well behaved android thing runs can be confusing/annoying. This is not a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The Oh, ya. There might be desktop users. thing seems to be an afterthought. This is not a criticism of the app itself. It can only do what it is programmed to do, But, desktop user manipulating user's library seems to unfortunately be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there is few things lacking as I can tell. In particular as of this date. Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use Winter Light a newer album/rehash, or whatever. I can live with that."
60080,"Spotify",2014-06-22,5,"Nice Service I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself. I notice the app plays short ads, where for some reason I do not if I use the web page on my PC, maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads."

60097,"Spotify",2016-04-04,5,"Awesome Great app all good music"
60098,"Spotify",2014-08-04,2,"Its like free. I tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you. Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice which probably costs money you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost.When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, we know you have to pay for cable, but we do not tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads.Pandora is the same.....do not want to pay, we interrupt your play. it is all about the money and getting more."
60099,"Spotify",2015-10-25,1,"From an extremely angry user I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads did not bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just do not want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit is not an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I would rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I am really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you have lost many users to this and you are just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I will just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. you are Welcome, Spotify"

It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire. I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues. They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope. The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."

But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist yes, and some new songs. I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
60132,"Spotify",2017-08-22,4,"Awesome service if you do not mind the subscription fee. Music choice is pretty great Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there is really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you will not find on the other. they are about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that is something you care about, hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they are pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I have found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you would like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can not stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it is worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that."

You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists.

Spotify makes it is own suggestions, and there are several add-ons last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc. that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what is new and popular.

When I am putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist I am working on - if i stay on it a second too long. THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it to the A's and i have to find where i was before. This happens a LOT and it is VERY annoying.I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!! The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love. It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's. i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can not find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately. i am frustrated over that.Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes I am sentimental happy"

I was constantly buying songs that I regretted within a few days of listening. But with Spotify, there is plenty of music to choose from and content for everyone. And I loved it so much without premium, but premium is even better. Not only can you skip songs, but you have a bunch of good music available at your fingertips. Get this app, I would recommend it to anyone, because it suits everyone."
60252,"Spotify",2015-06-29,3,"ALMOST perfect, BUT! Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the dollar 9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you do not want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
60254,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best app for music playing especially with student discount. do not waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was fifty percent of for me."
60255,"Spotify",2016-04-20,5,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon ... I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The loudness is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."

And some times it chooses a different song that is in your playlist. A positive it is will warn you that the song is explicit. Very nice. Refined it highly because every single song is on it."

For ten dollars a month you never need to buy another song again.That being said, I was heartbroken because I could not find my favorite song of all time: Starlight by Don Diablo and Matt Nash. This crushed me enough to give it a four star review. If you are into ultra-obscure music like me, this might not be the app for you. Give it a try, though. it is free!"

I hope so..."

It says I do not have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this is not. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it is a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you."

If I could express one concern/issue, it is the fact that every time an ad comes on the volume is dramatically increased....literally to the point where it is painful. I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I would be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate. Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?"

There is not anything that I haven't found and some I forgot about.I had not read any reviews prior to picking them out, my aim was to listen as I drive, I see I need premium. I do not want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I will enjoy it as is."

Spotify still does not see the need to provide any ability to control content, i.e. no option in settings to choose the radio version of songs and block explicit content versions. Not only is this an issue for users under eighteen, but it is an issue if folks over eighteen are want a music app to provide music at a party with kids. They have a family plan but the app is not family friendly at all. Also, all the lyrics are available for any user, no care about age.

But now it is changed into the equivalent of that.To sum it all up,I can not choose my own musicI could not care less about the suggested musicI hate the song-skip limitI just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I am unable to skip over to the song I want.I am just disappointed, tbh."

60808,"Spotify",2016-05-30,4,"Nice, I guess. This is one of my favorite apps. I love/need my music, and the fact that I can play it in the background is great. However, what is not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can not log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I am still in that country, and if you could fix this, I would give it five stars."
60812,"Spotify",2016-12-01,5,"DR 'Z' Unlike other music venues, I love the way you can listen to an entire album of a particular artist instead of only one song jumbled up among a bunch of other songs and artists. I love this format, I uninstalled the other venues."

I absolutely love Spotify. there is only one issue that I have and it is so worthless it does not even deserve to have a star taken off, but how come on the website it says that Premium's only for the phone and my Kindle should have it automatically? My Kindle is able to skip songs and choose any song but it has ads and I can not play My Songs music offline."
61140,"Spotify",2014-11-25,4,"WAY better than Pandora! Only one flaw with this on the kindle version vs. the app on my android tablet is that it will look like you have added a song/saved a song but it does not in fact save at all. I have had to go back and forth from my droid to kindle.This is basically exactly like google play and cost the same to go add free."
61143,"Spotify",2015-10-12,4,"Yesh Sporting is a great app. I love it because u can search up the sespific song u want, and it plays it.

61200,"Spotify",2015-02-17,3,"use to be cool Ok this is a good app but sense the update you need premium to pick any song you want. Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just do not enjoy lessening to the radio that is just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and do not mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app."

Just ephing stops, whether it be in the middle of the song, going to another song, does not matter. It just stops. When I go to press play it does nothing. How do you expect me to buy premium if it just stops? I rather just waste the three hundred or so hours ot'll take for me to download all of my personal music on to my phone then deal with this crappy, crap."

Very nice display, by the way and very easy to navigate around the various musical genres. Of course, I would love it if they offered a bit more in the international, world music department. And I am praying that Spotify expands the classical music selection as well. Still, this is one great app for the music lover!"
61307,"Spotify",2016-01-15,5,"Amazing. I love it!! It has all music.

This is what we waited for people. At first this app only let you listen to the radio unless you bought the premium version, but now you get an almost unlimited music selection for free without as many adds only about one or two every 5-6 songs There is still some stuff that needs worked out, like navigation and display, but it is well worth it!"

I am using the free premium trial for now, and will probably pay for it when it runs out. Just as an FYI: to make music available offline you MUST have the space in your phone. do not sign up for premium because of that perk without having the extra space."

It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over unlike pandora but dollar ten a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have ten apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."

61853,"Spotify",2016-12-22,5,"Worth it for family I use it every day while driving. My OWN music. Better than satellite radio or any other imo."
61855,"Spotify",2016-04-04,4,"you enjoy many options for streaming quality and you are allowed ... it is okay for listening to music. The music quality is not particularly outstanding unless you purchase Spotify Premium, in which case, you enjoy many options for streaming quality and you are allowed unlimited skips, which is a big plus."
61856,"Spotify",2016-11-22,5,"Five Stars good"
61858,"Spotify",2017-08-06,5,"AWESOME!!!!! Very awesome to listen to they have alllll the music I need!!!! DOWNLOAD PLZZZZZZ!!!!!!"
61866,"Spotify",2016-11-24,5,"Pretty good app This app is a very good music app. I only wish that you could download music and listen to specific songs for free."
61872,"Spotify",2014-10-06,5,"THIS MUST BE THE BEST EVER WAY TO HAVE THE MUSIC YOU WANT, NEED AND APPRECIATE 5* I am very impressed at the amount of music that is available and at a low cost. The one month trial period does allow literally hundreds of tracks to be had on my devices. If this continues the way that it is now, then I am definitely all for it. Thanks for this great idea, best yet in music distribution.."
61875,"Spotify",2016-11-24,3,"good It is a good app but their are some flaws .They need to allow you to skip without having to get premium. dollar _ dollar"
61876,"Spotify",2014-10-05,5,"Spotify revisited... Appeared by magic on my Kindle when I thought my original Spotify account was a fond memory. A very welcome return. The ads used to annoy me, but they seem less frequent than I remember. Am enjoying the superb range of music and checking out the themed playlists."
61889,"Spotify",2016-07-05,5,"Spotify makes it easier to listen to what I like and let us me listen to new and different types ... Music is uplifting and comforting. Spotify makes it easier to listen to what I like and let us me listen to new and different types of music."
61893,"Spotify",2016-01-18,3,"I love SPOTIFY!!!!! The only problem I have with the app is the premium. It costs ten dollars to get unlimited skips, non-shuffle mode, and a few other things. I think it is overpriced, but besides that its a great app."
61896,"Spotify",2015-08-21,5,"PARTAY TIME I have only one bad review for this. When I try to buy premium, it sends me to the internet browser and enter my credit card. I do not have a credit card, so I am not able to get premium. sad Asides from that, everything is awesome. I am able to find whatever music I want except a lot of anime ops and I only get a few adds. Way better than iTunes Radio and Pandora, if you ask me.If you ask a lot of people."
61897,"Spotify",2017-08-20,5,"Cool I like this alot"
61902,"Spotify",2014-12-16,3,"okay... at first I got spotify it was ok then it said cannot play music offline and u have to get premium for that so when I went to get premium I could not find it"
61905,"Spotify",2015-09-26,1,"Revert back. The reason I loved Spotify was because it was different than other music streaming apps, because I could pick what songs I wanted to listen to. One of the more recent updates has taken that feature away, which is very displeasing and has largely lowered the quality of the app in my opinion. Please revert back."
61908,"Spotify",2015-07-09,2,"No so good I use Spotify in my laptop, so I wanted for my cellphone to, but in the free version for cellphones you can not choose the song you want to hear, so I erease the app and continue with Deezer."

The catch: your music is stuck in shuffle mode and you can not take it off unless you have premium, then it works great! Also, sometimes you can not preview the song you want because it is stuck in shuffle."

62337,"Spotify",2015-08-26,1,"KINDLE FIRE IS A TABLET SO ANY SONG, RIGHT? NOPE!!!! STUCK WITH SHUFFLE The functionality of this app is fine and I really enjoy Spotify, but how gimmicky is it to offer any song listening on tablets and desktops but exclude Fires as tablets, which was a strong point of me getting this tablet. I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go and number 34;premium and number 34; or relegate us to and number 34;shuffle and number 34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE. SPOTIFY IS NOT HONEST IN ADVERTISEMENT."
