I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs.

"26",106,"Amazon",2014-07-03,1,"I know you are not listening, BUT For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever. You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them. You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps.",TRUE

"29",114,"Amazon",2014-08-29,1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, you know the rest. Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I am not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I am wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I have listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.. If you are listening on a web browser, it is constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music when clicking on other music that might interest you could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast to my knowledge. Now that I have purchased the year subscription, I will certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back.",TRUE

OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. let us say you are not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!it is also buggy. Several times, I have been told that my Prime tracks have been 100 percent downloaded. Then, when I am on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I am listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all.

"402",1305,"Amazon",2014-10-14,3,"No SD card support and some recordings not original I really was not sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it is just OK since the app is not all that bad lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I would have to stay with 3 stars.Issue number 1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I could not move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can not play any prime music, but that is OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue number 2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that did not make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I am sure there are many more. Disappointing.",TRUE

The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you do not like to listen to the same stuff over and over it is not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you do not get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there is not a problem.

"640",2173,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ? Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud will not let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for dollar 24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes I have comcast. I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You do not even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer. My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. do not get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !",TRUE

Edit=> For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently has not chosen to do so.But that is not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord you can use the one for charging. With your Windows PC and android device on signed on to both, both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC. I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named Amazon MP3 Mover that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.On copying my music from my PC to a folder Music I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear.

Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.With this service, I am wary that I might click on something and end up buying it.

It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store. The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere like from other play stores or even the Amazon site it would not be the latest version. In the end it still did not work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it. Very frustrating and a big waste of time. Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you are not into pop stuff.

"2881",9710,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Zero stars -useless for mobile purposes, purchases still go to internal memory, deleted all play lists on my device. The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine, but I feel like I have lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising listening whilst in motion.You now have to stop, go to additional screens with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!, and take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc..Unacceptable from both a safety car and /or usability standpoint exercise.When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile eg: hear a song in a store that you like- it STILL loads it to the internal memory. !!!My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it is an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you are sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is.Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I now know that I should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc..Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.I do not sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi.When I am on a road trip- it is my bandwidth that is used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I do not need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I am at home, fine. But it simply does not serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it is incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I will not be using their app will not be running across products to buy.",TRUE

I really do like the app, but it is a serious space hog and there just is not enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can not be moved to the SD card.

It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I am not going to risk testing it either since I am talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof! The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century.

For the most part I am enjoying Prime music--both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres. I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I am definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access.

I use it almost everyday. I am content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can not listen to.There have been a few errors with the program I have experienced. But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I will hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it is still loading.So, a little frustrated, I will start driving. It could not take that long could it?Sometimes it will come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still has not popped up.Usually. After reaching my destination, I will close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can not say 100 percent who is at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.Anyhow.

Now I finally decided to try to download all of it so I can put it in the car, and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I am now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which should not even be necessary in the first place, would not be able to do its job. it is not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you will end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50 percent of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been 01. Track Name.mp3 would end up just being called 01. Track N , with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I am not paying for bandwidth.it is difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they will give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme.",TRUE

While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?*In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.Pros:Not laggy and no bugs yetFree MusicGreat launch for PrimePop music for the masses.Cons:Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist.

Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can not imagine how they can not fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some do not. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I have uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but......nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It broke like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can not without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can not even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums?

The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the dollar 14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. was not getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I do not have a 3 month credit so we were not able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. Credits do not seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo were not worth their cost. would not recommend it to friends.

The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms. Play queue being an example. The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I am forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked all competitors have this functionality.Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it!

If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year year is visible once the album has been selected, but I have already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading. This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. it is common for me to view all albums, and it is 3 indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.I have also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the my recommendations screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list specific example below. Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it is a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it is not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is The Nexus by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that The Nexus is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not.",TRUE

"3524",11883,"Amazon",2016-11-04,2,"Prime Unlimited Good Value, iPhone App just So So, Echo integration Poor I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think dollar 7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons - easy things to fix:1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it will not try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it does not even shuffle on the command Echo Shuffle My Music or Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account . On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say shuffle again and skip a song. Then it says enabling shuffle mode and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the dollar 25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to number 3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review.",TRUE

"3526",11885,"Amazon",2016-11-21,3,"App works well, the upload process and programs is horrendously bad. I am using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I am looking for.I have got about 30k songs in my collection. I am trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices including my echo. The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:1 I have got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110 percent CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.2 The underlying threads kindof work I get lots of Cloud Service Not Responding Errors , you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it is so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click got it and have the popup dissappear.3 The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it is actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20 percent of the time if you are uploading 5 songs at a time. If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever even hours after it completed uploading the last file. You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service from what I can tell. If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive.",TRUE

Uploads are not intuitive at all.In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs.

"3531",11903,"Amazon",2012-04-26,2,"I love it, but ... UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old and long gone Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon which also sold me the 64gb SD card. This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. it is a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it is immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 or more, each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it is hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider Verizon instead of any shortcoming with Amazon.

GooglePlay will allow you to upload your entire library from your PC, either iTunes, Windows Media player, etc. Its pretty good, all the songs uploaded and you can create playlists and download those playlists to whatever device you are using.Amazon's does that, pretty much. However, not all songs uploaded. I tried rescanning and rescanning, and ever time it finds a few more songs to upload. One album of mine in particular it absolutely refuses to upload. Nothing is wrong with the format, or any of the locations I tried moving the songs to in order to try an upload... just tells me there is not anything new in the folders to upload. And no, they are not in the amazon library at all with me just missing them. I checked the entire darn thing.Also, it uploaded quite a few songs multiple times. Some songs will not play all the way through. I can not seem to find a way to move an entire playlist to my device instead of just streaming the music using my data that I am limited on.

Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I have purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I have purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I have not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I am not sure it is possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use.

"3731",12628,"Amazon",2014-07-22,5,"I will NEVER use iTunes again! It took me about one week to figure out all the the INs-and-OUTs of the app on my iphone. All I can say is that I will not EVER use iTunes again. I have a total love affair with my iPad and iPhone, but I have never had any great love lost for iTunes. Now with this really great application, I will not ever worry about it again...ever.First of all--if for nothing else--there are more than a million songs available on Prime Music. You have to do nothing more than choose the music you want to listen to then download it to your device even prime music can be downloaded to a tablet or smart phone. When it has been downloaded to your tablet or smart phone, then you can listen without streaming. Hours and hours of music, and a whole host of it for free! There are also pre-created playlists that Amazon suggests, and you can add this playlist with a simple click, touch, or swipe of the finger!Then any music you have purchased in just about forever is available on your Amazon cloud. The trick to getting pre-existing music from the cloud to show up on your device is to add a playlist in your cloud which I just titled all my music and then select your music to add to a playlist. Then once it is in a playlist, you can download all your music at once with the download arrow on your device.Also, if you have uploaded music to your Amazon cloud, that music is there, too!After you have downloaded music, if you do not want it, then you swipe the song to the left, and it gives you the option to delete. The same left-swipe option allows you to download single songs-instead all your songs-from the cloud.This application works FLAWLESSLY on my iPhone. A coworker has an android smartphone, and it works flawlessly on hers, too.This is now my go-to app for all my music. I do not use iTunes at all. I can find ALL my music. I also like the various ways I can look at music, either in a list or individually. I can mix so that I am playing tunes in random order instead of hearing the same list over and over again. I can listen to my entire Amazon music library on the computer, through my tablet or phone, just practically anywhere.This app is IT for me. Thanks, Amazon! Job well done...again and again and again.One more thing: if you are having trouble making the app work for you, then try Amazon's help link for the Amazon Prime Music App. Go to Prime Music in Amazon, and keep clicking on links that say Learn more about Prime Music until you get to the Amazon Help. There, you will find a three-minute video about Amazon Prime Music. Also there are additional links in the left-hand column if you are on your PC that will benefit you, too.Happy listening!!",TRUE

But why on earth does this need to know where you are within a 5' radius? It can easily determine which ads you should receive and which stations you are allowed to listen to by using COARSE location data. It does not need GPS precision for anything other than to sell that information to whomever is interested in buying it.It runs at startup, running constantly in the background tracking your every movement even if you are not listening to it. Why?Plus, it gets your list of accounts on your device. All of them. Does Clear Channel need to know about all of your accounts on your Android?

Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can not like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can not save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist. This app is great all in all.

"7683",25757,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-22,5,"Super Solid Internet Radio App, Clear Cut Privacy Policy What a honest, neat app! First, a quick treatment concerning the permissions. I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy, and everything is upfront and optable. ClearChannel only shares information with 3rd Parties in two cases: a delegation directly involved in providing app services b when the user *voluntary* opt-ins for marketing none of that you automatically agreed to get marketed guff. When I initially looked at the social circle registration, I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications. The email address registration is the most private method of registration. All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in-app adverts; however, they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming, nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing. These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you X out of them. Otherwise, for a freebie radio with custom channels, this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design, I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad, confusing, advertising riddled interfaces. iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI. I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what, but in about 6 minutes I had my custom Beatles channel made and audio commercial-free streaming. Sweet! I especially love the mix selector. Double Sweet! On top of everything, a moderately low RAM footprint approx 46mbs during streaming, less than my Chrome Browser.

I have a Facebook account. But I HATE it when sites want me to use that since I consider it a security/privacy risk to log into everything using Facebook. let us face it, Facebook can not even keep people from making damaging, virus laden applications so they are hardly the epitome of safe sites. I prefer setting up different passwords for different sites.This app also seems to have issues keeping track of the songs I have liked and disliked when I shut it down and restart it. The web version does not seem to be synched up to the app version despite me logging into my account to get my personalized stations. that is a shame because I keep having to tell it I hate certain artists to get it to not play them every time I use the app on my Kindle.Other than that, I have no problems with it.

Other people I know say the same and that iHeart should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for 20 hours and all day Sunday, when the Big Show is not broadcast!",TRUE

Just more headaches. The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who do not sit hitting buttons all day long.

I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening as I worked around the house until lunch time. Both are News/Talk stations. My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem Daaaad... my Kindle is not working right... .Several updates ago about a month or so, it just stopped working. When it does turn on it is not reliable as an alarm anymore, it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing. I have to close the app or stop the station and then hit play again. It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked. Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I do not really use my Kindle Fire HD. Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest versions just do not work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it is not the station.

I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything. I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer. I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened. I assumed the battery was drained. I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else. I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes. Then I tried opening it. Nothing. I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime. I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared. The indicator said 64 percent charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle. Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared. I entered my PIN, nothing. Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked. I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora. I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal. I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network. I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books.",TRUE

Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, 80's rock.

I was looking for an all-in-one app something like iTunes-but they dont make iTunes for my device, and this one came closest to the mark.You can listen three ways:--Upload all your own music--Purchase music from Pandora--Listen to unlimited, free music in the form of radio stations The feature I like the most is the Radio Station maker . You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence, and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.For example, if you like a specific genre of music, you can choose that search feature, Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike-you click on skip button and it will be discarded from your station.You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.You can make other radio stations and keep the many different stations you make in a library by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.You can make radio stations of a single band, specific genre's, or many other different ways.it is a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first, or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love, and even find other bands you have never heard before based on music you like.The app comes in a free, ad-based version the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless, or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one, and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials.Great music listening software!",TRUE

I would use it more if I did not have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about: 1 Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2 when I select an artist to start with, it seems they do not play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited. For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I will hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I will hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others. So maybe this app is not for me.",TRUE

You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there is no limit on how many channels you can have. there is the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there is always the alternative and unlimited way to skip a song: just change stations.

"11620",39051,"Pandora",2015-02-18,5,"Pandora Review Five star rating for excellence in music. Two things I would recommend though. 1. do not put adds on, even if you haven't upgraded to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? that is my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the superb bookmarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! happy",TRUE

Being introduced to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to. The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music. Overall, I am pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.

When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more.

I have been using this App for years, since my first iPhone 3G. This has been by far my favorite music app. Free! Who does not like free?! High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone. A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R and B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all. Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening. Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again. Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button! No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.Give it a try and you will not regret it.

"12862",43151,"Pandora",2012-04-25,5,"Free Music! If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour although it is not unlimited.However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora One for a dollar 4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive however, there is still a skip limit with Pandora One. There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for dollar 0.99. That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on for example, only on weekdays. It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a sleep timer that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes so that the app does not play music all night while you sleep.",TRUE

It is not perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you do not want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For dollar 36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you mostly love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!",TRUE

"13309",44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about those ads, about those ads no music So when I downloaded this app, I found that it is conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone. I did not mind the idea of watching ads, because it is a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow. But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for. But that is not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad. I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you are given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well. Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you are not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like rewind ; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a like/dislike on the track. I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, did not take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I did not want to be hearing. In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I did not want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity.",TRUE

Finding artists albums and songs are easy enough, but listening to the music is frequently interrupted with adverstisements much more often than like services such as Pandora.

Because I love Spotify. it is essentially all I listen to when I am at the desktop so putting it on my tablet seemed a no-brainer. And when it worked it was great. The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small Less than 17 songs?, it would start throwing in random songs, as though you would created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I will make a playlist with a single song because, well, that is how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the suggested songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there was not enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it is still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market.",TRUE

"15935",53291,"Spotify",2014-11-19,4,"wonderful except for compatibility issues I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it is absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon is not to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they are even sure that the app works, then they should not complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info.Bottom line - it is an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it is one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you do not have to listen to a whole lot of music that you do not want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it is still worth it. The premium version is dollar 9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again.",TRUE

"16926",56512,"Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People do not understand this amazing app. This app is simply amazing. it is musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a station or mix and that feature is decent. The algorithms are not great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that do not want to pay for premium service, you do not have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I am aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you do not need to pay dollar 9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they do not email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I have had my account for 5 months and I do not think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. happy",TRUE

The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can not really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it is not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips.",TRUE

"17426",58185,"Spotify",2015-07-22,5,"This is genius! Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since sold this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs if I am not mistaken that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you will not have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it is going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you do not want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have disposable playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what is the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123.

Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also does not have the option to delete/deactivate your account.

I mean let us face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment.

"17817",59551,"Spotify",2015-10-08,2,"what happened? I have had spotify on my kindle for the almost three years, and its been great to me the whole time: I could find just about any song I wanted, queue up my own playlist in the order I want, and listen to individual songs at my leisure. It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I do not think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you do not, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend dollar 24 a month just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone!

Then for the downgraded devices, you do not have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it is no issue for me at all.

"17924",59945,"Spotify",2014-09-11,1,"Oh, so I have to pay to listen to my own music I already own? BEST SCAM EVER!!!! At first I could not believe people would pay for this service. Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN. Where to begin...First, disclaimer: I am an audiophile. I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies. I am just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake. So enough said... now let us get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.1. Algorithm. Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project Pandora algorithm, but fails miserably. All algorithms have to learn first, that is understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I am listening to Punk Rock. In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that is an understatement.2. GUI. Not horrible, but certainly not the best. Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it is not automatically intuitive and at the ready. Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!! If it is playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly. Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.3. Paying to play owned music. This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person. While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music if you pay a monthly fee, if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly????? Can someone make sense of this to me? Why are people paying for this, again???? Ridiculous. Developers: The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!! Otherwise, why even have this feature? Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service. Let the people play their owned music for free.4. Equalizer. Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED. Look up Poweramp.5. Cost. So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good. Well, guess you will listen to music you do not like...A LOT. Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora for half the price. If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once for several devices, not just every device, and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify.",TRUE

I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials! You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you do not have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you are listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you are listening to.And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well.

Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track.

"18025",60251,"Spotify",2015-08-16,5,"Give it time and you will love it Why is spotify better then all of the other music apps? Keep in mind just like every other music app if you want unlimited anything you have to pay a price. Spotify is 99 cents for the first 3 months and then 99 cents for each additional monthcheapest out of them all●offline listing●make your own play lists●unlimited skips●share play lists with friends●good suggestions but not alot it is not annoying● if the Playlist says g-eazy they are actually going to play g-eazy. Not iggy isalias.●Multiple playlists●with premium you can look up a whole library of music by search word ex: country hits or Katy perry and you can look through a already made Playlist or albums upon albums of music and you can play whatever you choose.Personally I was a Pandora person but a friend forced me to use it for a week and once you build up your Playlist with the music you like you will forget about Pandora or whatever you currently use. Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plusSo my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy. You do not need premium to enjoy this app. Ads are reasonable not annoying",TRUE

The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the dollar 9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you do not want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT.",TRUE

Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle.

"18597",62217,"Spotify",2014-06-16,2,"It is not what I originally thought... When I first bought the app for free through the advise of my sister, I was thrilled by the number of skips and how many songs you could download. But turns out these are really members for premium members. All of my downloaded songs were deleted and I was not allowed to skip anymore. What I wonder is why can easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money, but I do not like this feature. Also. they play unrelated songs when your trial is over. You could get all the features you want, but only if you upgrade to premium membership.",TRUE
