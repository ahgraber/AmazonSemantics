3,"Amazon",2017-10-03,5,"Amazon Music is great, I don't know why I didn't get it ...   Amazon Music is great , I don't know why I didn't get it sooner. love it."
6,"Amazon",2015-08-17,1,"Not happy   In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She doesn't have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify.  At least that's a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile."
11,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Not bad considering its free!   Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed."
12,"Amazon",2017-07-23,5,"#mynumberoneusedapp   Idk if I could live without this app!!!!"
22,"Amazon",2017-07-21,5,"Love this!   I can listen anywhere to the music I've already selected.  Love this!!!"

48,"Amazon",2017-03-02,5,"Its Free   Its Free"
50,"Amazon",2015-04-15,5,"I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movie   I started out by taking advantage of the prime 30 day free trial. I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I don't have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV.Thanks again.Love Amazon and Prime Amazon.Keep up the good work"
56,"Amazon",2016-11-22,4,"How cool is that   YOu can think of a lot of songs and then they are there for almost free (Prime cost). How cool is that, no CD's no tapes , no records just right there. Not all music shows up , but the majority of the time i find what i am looking for. The search could be more easier but perhaps it is my searching technique ;-)"
62,"Amazon",2017-04-21,4,"Four Stars   love it"
63,"Amazon",2017-08-12,5,"Great choices, works perfect on my phone   Great choices,  works perfect on my phone"
66,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Best streaming music service I've found   It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."
70,"Amazon",2017-06-10,5,"Five Stars   great"
74,"Amazon",2017-06-04,3,"Three Stars   ok app"
77,"Amazon",2017-08-11,5,"Five Stars   Works  great."
82,"Amazon",2015-09-27,5,"Come for the shipping, stay for the free music and movies!   AZ keeps adding more reasons to use Prime. This is one of them. Lots of music to hear for free on a variety of devices.  Come for the shipping, stay for the music and movies!"
83,"Amazon",2017-10-30,4,"Four Stars   I like"
84,"Amazon",2014-06-23,2,"Prime Music Needs Work   Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection is small and includes mostly older music. While it generally works OK for the music it does have I was unable to find any way to just search the music that is available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I went to listen to a song it was going to charge me.If you were able to limit the search and list of songs to only those available for free I would have given it a higher score but at the moment it was a lot more frustration than listening pleasure."
85,"Amazon",2017-06-11,5,"Five Stars   Nice"
87,"Amazon",2017-06-01,5,"Five Stars   Love"
89,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"great service all kinds of music   great service all kinds of music.  would be great if it had a voice recognition to search for music while you drive"
92,"Amazon",2016-04-07,5,"Works great now.   It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless."
96,"Amazon",2017-10-10,5,"Five Stars   Love Amazon music"
97,"Amazon",2015-02-20,1,"Not working on my device   I have tried over & over again to get this app to open on my phone.  I keep getting an Account Error ""Exception #45"".  I have reported the problem & get no reply from Amazon customer service."
98,"Amazon",2017-05-03,5,"SO FAR SO GOOD,   AT A PRESENT TIME MY NUMBER ONE SUPPLIER."
99,"Amazon",2013-01-09,3,"Great concept, wish it worked better   I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it.  Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing.  I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre.  That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me.  Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to.  I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon."
100,"Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually Works Well   This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
101,"Amazon",2016-11-06,5,"Five Stars   Excellent product as advertized"
102,"Amazon",2017-07-18,4,"Four Stars   Ok"
105,"Amazon",2014-06-15,3,"Lacking content, but free   Get free music from a service that you already pay for.  How can you not like it!!  The selection is a little scarce, but it's new, so I'm sure the selection will increase in time.  Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service (which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors) instead of launching additional services.  Just seems a little backwards to me, but I won't complain about something free!!"
109,"Amazon",2017-03-03,5,"It is great!   I adore this app. It is great !"
115,"Amazon",2017-06-27,4,"Four Stars   eewf"
118,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"It should be free to download   Some songs to download you have to buy , so again whats the point of been a prime member ? Amazon is trying to squeeze every cents out of us.🤔💱"
119,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"So very satisfied..   If you have prime, use this!  My musical tastes are vast.  If you sometimes vary far off the beaten path your needs will be met and expanded.So very satisfied... nothing is quite as good as being introduced to music you may like and having them hit the nail on the head.Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes."
122,"Amazon",2015-04-23,4,"I like it, wish it had more Hawaiian - - Jawaiian flare   I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music, I like it for the most part - there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free.  I took one star away because, like I said before - - it's only POPULAR music.  I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music.  Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music, but I'm more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio."
124,"Amazon",2015-10-19,1,"Awful   I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat."
125,"Amazon",2015-12-05,5,"A great app to use on my android phone and tablet   A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I'm on other devices then my computer."
129,"Amazon",2017-03-15,5,"Good deal   Wonderful selections, great sound....fantastic Prime benefit."
136,"Amazon",2016-06-18,2,"Nothing to write home about.   Its a decent bonus, but its no replacement for anybof my other music apps. The 1st 3 songs I tried to find werent in the collection, and the app doesn't play well withy android platform. I deleted it."
139,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Best Music App Ever!!!   This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."
141,"Amazon",2016-10-14,1,"One Star   Doesn't work on a note 7"
142,"Amazon",2015-03-30,1,"I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true   I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true! Like Netflix, RedBox and any of the others like it, there are always loopholes/limitations. Every movie, song, book I've tried to download, it wasn't included in the Prime package.  I can just as easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same applies to music/videos.  Looks like the only thing that I'm going to benefit from by purchasing Prime is the free shipping for my Christmas shopping."
146,"Amazon",2017-05-05,5,"Five Stars   Good"
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
162,"Amazon",2017-05-25,5,"Great app   Great app, lots of good tunes. So much available for free to prime members!"
163,"Amazon",2017-09-30,4,"Four Stars   good music"
165,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon music with prime music   I have tried downloading it my 3 units Desk top is OK but does not let me access all my playlistsMy Android only seem to have some of the Albums but mostly singles from the albums listedMy note pad I installed it, then I had a problem so I deleted it now it tells me I already have it loaded but I cannot find the icon to reinstall itAll you seem to want is for me to purchase more music though prime, when I can't play the music I already have loaded"
167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right   It's an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle, echo, music, prime, etc. they can't seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
169,"Amazon",2015-07-21,1,"Fundamental Process Flaws   1) When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 clicks.  Amazon forces you to load the app, wait for the library to update (which takes some time), find it in the library, then download it.  If the internet were ubiquitous, I would not need to download. But since it isn't I download first. Please don't make this so hard.2) Each time I buy something, I am prompted to download the app (with a pop us that really pushes you to download the app). I already have the app, so quit confusing me."
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five Stars   Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
175,"Amazon",2015-04-19,2,"Amazon Music with Prime Music   Very obtuse, difficult to navigate and select genre which are very limited.  I had an even harder time with it on my phone.  It also says you can ""download"" music if you are a Prime member but I haven't figured out how to do it without paying for the songs. If it is possible that is fine but it apparently isn't user friendly."
178,"Amazon",2016-10-17,1,"I used to use Amazon music with my Prime account ...   I used to use Amazon music with my Prime account. Now Amazon won't install on my phone, so I can't. Until it gets fixed I can't give it more than one star."
181,"Amazon",2016-02-16,3,"It plays and allows you to choose most songs.   The 500 song limit is cheesy, the radom function is not! Program runs extremely slow when adding songs to playlist"
185,"Amazon",2017-03-14,1,"One Star   The music should be free with the prime membership."
189,"Amazon",2016-01-17,5,"Animal need MORE MUUUUUSIC!   Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that songs I consider my favorites, that really shouldn't be rare or hard to find, are amiss from this app... oh well,  the pros must definitely outweigh the cons."
190,"Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"is not that bad   The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3."
192,"Amazon",2016-01-12,5,"Best music app!   This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you're devices. There are stations recommended for you & playlists you can create by adding music to your library. It's definitely my new go-to for music. It's like combining Pandora & an MP3 player. Best of birth worlds!"
193,"Amazon",2014-11-05,1,"Can't download just to my normal music files. Have ...   Can't download just to my normal music files. Have to have extra app just to listen and had to pay to do that when I already pay for prime. Too costly for just streaming basically......."
196,"Amazon",2017-03-11,5,"Five Stars   Excellent results."
208,"Amazon",2016-12-25,1,"I think of myself as quite well technicall aware person... but this all is the most horrible one i have ever encountered!!!   the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!"
209,"Amazon",2017-10-16,5,"Five Stars   Good music"
211,"Amazon",2016-11-09,5,"Five Stars   Love this app. It has so many features."
214,"Amazon",2014-07-12,4,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works!   This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. It's a shame because of the amount of music available."
217,"Amazon",2014-12-14,5,"I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders ...   I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders etc, but Amazon Music is such a complete system, when you have prime, I have been moving to it. Thanks Amazon."
218,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Amazon is Great!   Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I don't have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of 250 songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
222,"Amazon",2017-02-28,1,"One Star   Doesn't work with Nougat."
223,"Amazon",2017-07-19,5,"Why don't you have this?   If your a prime member, there's no reason not to use music. No interruptions, all kinds of choices. A must!"
224,"Amazon",2016-09-12,5,"love being able to select many songs that I like ...   love being able to select many songs that I like and have them played when I want....dissapointed that many artists are not available likeMichael Jackson"
228,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Good music selection and easy download   Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes."
231,"Amazon",2016-06-25,1,"Another stupid music app   Who needs another worthless waste of space & RAM app?"
232,"Amazon",2015-06-05,3,"Clunky UI, buggy, and uninformative   CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
233,"Amazon",2014-08-25,3,"doesn't always work   I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
234,"Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"This app sucks   This app sucks.  I read there is not a charge it's free.  Ya right until you try to download a song.  I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance.  It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!!  Gee wiz"
236,"Amazon",2014-12-27,5,"Buy An Amazon Prime Membership!!  NOW!!   If you don't see an Amazon Prime Membership paying off, just for the free two day shipping alone, then Do It For The Music!! You will Never have a lack of music that you love, no matter what style, genre, or artist. It's All Here!!  And, that's not even mentioning what's available if you have Amazon Fire TV Boxes, or Amazon Fire TV Stick!! At $99.00 per year, that comes out to $8.25 per month!! You can finally say Goodbye to Cable TV, Satellite TV, etc........FOREVER!!!  I Did!!"
238,"Amazon",2016-01-25,5,"Super Job with Amazon Prime Music!   I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music!  I have just started using this service,  but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch!  An endless selection of artists stations as well.  Great job Amazon!"
240,"Amazon",2015-01-02,1,"Completely Useless - Randomly stops stream.  Way better options to stream music.   The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used.  It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music.  This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device.  It even stops on my Kindle.  You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope.  I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping.  If I wasn't a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services."
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App needs some improvement.   I use this app all the time.  Unfortunately, it can not be used safely while driving.On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel.A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
248,"Amazon",2015-12-08,5,"Love the free music on my pc   Love the free music on my pc. Even got it to stream to my Ouya to listen on the surround sound in the living room"
252,"Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffers, and stalls   For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it doesn't transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I'm not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
254,"Amazon",2015-10-25,4,"ok app for bbz10   Good app but on the blackberry z10 it gives me some trouble but nothing just restarting the app will not fix."
255,"Amazon",2017-03-13,3,"Needs easier connection to Samsung Multiroom.   Nice to have on the phone, but it doesn't work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I didn't find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home."
257,"Amazon",2016-09-28,4,"Wow!   Totally Great"
258,"Amazon",2015-10-14,4,"love my music   Works great j my phone, Kinrle Fire, and pc. Can't seem to get it on my older tablet but I'm still working on it."
261,"Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"A Grandmother with an MP3 App?   I listen to music, as I take my daily walk.  I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable.  The Amazon MP3 app is amazing.  It's always there!  I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before.  The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick.  I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.  I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers."
266,"Amazon",2015-11-04,1,"never did figure out how to get any of the ...   never did figure out how to get any of the benefits of prime to work before my free trial ended. no clue how to play music or watch anything"
270,"Amazon",2017-11-11,4,"Four Stars   Solid player."
276,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"Update sucks   This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card  continue listening to music.Not happy!"
277,"Amazon",2016-08-11,2,"Would NOT Work!   Would NOT play audio on android. Show that it's playing but NO! audio. Tried everything to no avail. Even reformatted device and still no audio!  DISSAPOINTED!"
278,"Amazon",2017-05-08,5,"Love my Amazon Music!   Amazon music is easy to use and I can find anything I want to listen to on it. I'm so much happier since I started my service. Since starting it I've dropped my Sirius account and Pandora. Strictly Amazon music for this girl from now on!"
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do ...   I have Rhapsody now, so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is, rhapsody is easier and I don't have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/food(way to expensive!)/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
284,"Amazon",2012-11-23,1,"stole my dollar   After buying some items on amazon I was rewarded a dollar to verbal song on amazon music I went to buy a song with that dollar and halfway through it says I don't have internet when I'm using WiFi I checked and my WiFi was fine so I switched to my 3g and tried it again and it still wouldn't download. So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents. I looked through everything with music and it never downloaded and I have no way of getting the songs unless I bought them again. What a rip off ! If there was a way to retrieved my songs I would be happy but as far as I can tell there isn't :("
289,"Amazon",2015-05-18,4,"LOVE this app   As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora (my previous favorite) any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and ...   I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
303,"Amazon",2017-03-08,5,"Great for any music lover   Love and use it"
305,"Amazon",2015-01-29,1,"why I need to change phone's language to use this app?   Dear Amazon,USA is an international country with people speaking on more than 6 most common languages. Android (thanks to Google folks) kind of thought of this, so Android system is adjustable for any of more than 50 languages. I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems.  Until this will be fixed, I would stay with Google."
307,"Amazon",2017-05-05,5,"Five Stars   Good music selection.  No streaming issues."
308,"Amazon",2015-10-22,3,"Not impressed.   It's not horrible, but it doesn't have near the music selection that spotify does. It wants to charge you for so much."
309,"Amazon",2017-11-02,1,"One Star   I did not think I would have to give more money to hear the music when I want to."
318,"Amazon",2016-10-28,5,"Music for everyone😁!   I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot.I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free.I am overall happy with it.Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear."
319,"Amazon",2015-02-06,3,"mediocre music service   I'll vote in the mediocre as ""ok"" because that's all it deserves.  The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of books I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle.  Otherwise, the Music app is below par.  Clunky download/upload application and the service doesn't have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels.  It's good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that's about it."
320,"Amazon",2016-05-30,5,"Amazing app!   Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music."
324,"Amazon",2016-08-24,3,"Only use it if you already have prime.   Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this."
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime!   This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
329,"Amazon",2016-11-03,4,"I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics   I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were.  Although I wish like with Google music, when listening to a station, you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better."

343,"Amazon",2013-10-08,5,"Thank you Amazon !!!  I received a great gift from you   I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs.  It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs.  At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!!  I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Thank you Amazon !!"
344,"Amazon",2017-08-07,4,"rock on   works excellent with my prime account, plenty of music for everyone's taste"
349,"Amazon",2014-06-24,2,"useless, app keep saying i have an issue in my prime account while prime management Web page States there is no issue at all   Really was excited about this addition but the app keeps asking me to renew my prime subscription and to go to the main prime Webpage to see the problem,  when entering the Webpage there is no problem.  In conclusion I cannot listen to my added music by using the app"
354,"Amazon",2017-04-26,5,"super super happy with Amazon Music.   super super happy with Amazon Music."
358,"Amazon",2017-05-06,5,"Music at its best   I really enjoy this site. Songs are so easy to download and make a playlist. It's also very easy to use"
370,"Amazon",2015-06-01,3,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate   The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."
372,"Amazon",2014-06-27,1,"Couldn't get Amazon Prime Music to quickly and conveniently download music to my phone   After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone (Android).  I was disappointed.  It allowed me to download and play one album for free.  However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time.  So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly.  I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."

378,"Amazon",2017-01-11,4,"Beware Windows 10   I would have given it 5 stars, however, when my Windows 8 computer crashed, during the transfer to the dreaded and despised Windows 10, I lost the ability to play or rip from Amazon Music.  No one has been able to correct this; so I now purchase cds."
389,"Amazon",2017-07-29,5,"Five Stars   Great app!"
391,"Amazon",2016-10-23,5,"Thanks for the memories and the future to come!   I'm listening to ""Hamilton"" the Broadway musical now. What more could I want? My daughters are grown and gone. Can't depend on them to keep me up to date in the music department.  Amazon music will fill the bill!  Great selection. Thanks Amazon Prime.  ;-)"
400,"Amazon",2017-01-07,2,"Too difficult to deal with. I was able to ...   Too difficult to deal with. I was able to download some music but I have no idea how to do it again."
402,"Amazon",2016-01-22,5,"A must have   Great app! I can just listen to music on the run, or I can make playlists and mark favorites as I hear them. My favorite thing is being able to download songs for offline listening. That has to be the best feature."
403,"Amazon",2017-02-28,1,"Junk   As few features they have for yhis app you might think they would work, unfortunately often they don't. Feels like this app is just a marketing ploy to make people think they are getting more from Amazon prime then they will."
407,"Amazon",2016-03-29,5,"Love the music   I've been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now.  I love that there are no commercials.  Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices!  The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!"
411,"Amazon",2017-11-08,5,"Five Stars   Love this. I can listen to music while I study without all the annoying adds."
416,"Amazon",2017-02-06,2,"Small music selection. Confusing   Doesn't seem to be much to offer here that has music in which I am interested. I thought this was free, but then it keeps wanting me to upgrade to another level. Not much value from what I understand, especially compared to what I get on Pandora."
418,"Amazon",2011-08-27,5,"best mp3 player, and if it could play drm files it would be perfect   Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."

423,"Amazon",2017-06-02,3,"Three Stars   I need a ""how to"" manual.  There is no instruction"
424,"Amazon",2014-08-31,2,"But I guess that is also nice to have as a backup   My first download was the Beatles - which turned out to be a front band.The music choices are limited - and the phone app is kind of hard to use on android.But since it comes with free with prime - maybe I'll keep prime as long as you don't keep upping the price.I don't really use the video stream as I have Netflix - which the same thing - the netflix app is easier to use and more recent choices.But I guess that is also nice to have as a backup."

431,"Amazon",2016-12-04,5,"Great Service   I enjoy this service- included in Prime membership, great music selection and I can find basically anything. I don't see the need to use any other music service. Plus unlimited skips and I haven't found a song yet that I couldn't download for free."
436,"Amazon",2014-05-23,1,"WTF!!   Amazon sent me an offer for $3.00 in free music so I went to the MP3 store and accidently hit the ""buy"" button rather whatever button I was supposed to hit to get the free offer.  Okay, fine, it's only $3.00 but then I couldn't even get the MP3 app to work on my Galaxy 3 Android.  I get error #45, which I tried Googling but got no resolve.  I'll stick with the I Heart Radio app."
439,"Amazon",2017-04-04,5,"Absolutely love it.   I use this app a lot. Love the pre-made Playlist feature. Works well for long trips"
441,"Amazon",2015-08-06,5,"Perhaps the best   The music selection is outstanding and the access could not be any easier. Th esuggestions are almost always spot on or very close to what I enjoy and prefer. One more reason that I really enjoy my Prime Membership and plan on being a life long member."
443,"Amazon",2017-01-22,3,"Problems Combining!   I have an audible account in my name and my wife has Amazon Prime in hers. I really wish there was a way to consolidate both accounts. and why the heck cant I listen to music on me echo and my wife is listening in her car? that's just stupid."

463,"Amazon",2015-09-25,1,"It chews up your 4G data plan because of their BAD default update settings choice   The app is preset to download updates even if you are on your 4G and ignores the regular android settings of no large downloads except over 801 wireless. Chewed up MULTI-MEGABYTES over 4G before I realized what it, and it's companion apps, had done and how to turn it off. Total BS that they don't set the default update setting to ""Only over wireless"""

Very disappointed with this app cause I'm unable to use it."
482,"Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"I love my Prime Music   I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iHeart with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played.  There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues."
485,"Amazon",2014-11-15,5,"Amazon Prime music is awesome   I order a lot of stuff from Amazon but the 2day shipping is now a benefit to the music. My wife says that I am stuck in the 70's when it comes to music but I do like 50's and 60's rock and roll too. I have put almost 700 songs in my music library and I ain't done yet. Thanks to my iPhone and my tablet and my awesome Bluetooth speaker I can take my favorite music anywhere. Amazon Prime is worth the cost just for the music and the videos."
487,"Amazon",2016-02-04,5,"This is a great service   This is a great way to listen to music you already love, and stumble across new music you will grow to love.  It's also a fun way to find those hidden gems from your past that you'd forgotten about.  I can listen in a bunch of places, and even got a lot of nursery rhymes downloaded to play for my twins wherever we are!"
488,"Amazon",2016-03-23,3,"Generally good app   I listen to this app daily. It is lacking some functionality, but creating playlists is super easy. This app would be better of you could select the music folder to pull from (on an sd card). Also, the last patch broke the continuous repeat one song function. The song only repeats once and then app closes."
490,"Amazon",2016-11-22,5,"Must have !!!!!! Five *****   I am telling everyone I know how amazing the music app is. NO commercials. List to what songs you want, as many times as you want.

492,"Amazon",2015-07-03,3,"Nice to not hear ads, but pre-mixed playlists aren't the best.   Should recommend other songs similar to what you're listening to. Also, most radio/playlists suck. Switched to Google Play because they have free playlists (with ads) but a great Gym mix. Step up your game Amazon! I pretty much give them 1/2 my paycheck every two weeks because I love Amazon stuff. This isn't doing it for me though... but I'm sure they'll algorithm it out soon."

It was easy to browse through all the songs and pick out those I wished to include in playlists, then used Bluetooth to play on my boat.  The selection is somewhat limited, but still had plenty of variety.  Wish there were some Jimmy Buffet songs to pick, but only knock-offs.  Fairly intuitive, one-button play for each playlist - hopefully the available music list will grow!"

You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."
654,"Amazon",2015-08-20,5,"Bought lots of songs on it. Very convenient. Easy to navagate menu on computer exe and phone app   Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while. The promo credit for shipping on a longer time schedule gave us the opportunity to buy lots of songs for free, now we are hooked. Too bad that promo ended."

The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy."
671,"Amazon",2016-12-21,2,"I Want a Divorce   I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed."

You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free (but not really). Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."

723,"Amazon",2015-12-04,1,"Not user friendly AT ALL   Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better.-It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.)-Search function is crap. Many times I have  typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm looking for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE!-&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again.-Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music.There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here."

They're making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I don't use it.  Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can't even get your music from it anymore."

An hour after launching the program, it came up, indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production.  Great.  Unchecked the load from windows media player again, the library was back to normal.  Now today, it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it.  This program isn't worth it anymore."

910,"Amazon",2015-07-19,3,"No uSD card support; no prime stations; no streaming   I like Prime Music, especially the prime stations. So much ""free"" music (with your $99/year membership). I like the app, on my Windows desktop. I don't like the app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) for 3 reasons. First, because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music, your Amazon Cloud music, or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s, you either have to forget about them, add them to the cloud for a fee, or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card, I'd give the app at least 4 stars. As it is, it barely qualifies for 3. Second, you can't stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay, and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third, the prime stations are absent from the Android (and the Roku) app. What's up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I've purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3, and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available, the iTunes and others are not. I don't want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I'm only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app, and I'll revisit my score."

The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps.

I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!!

1012,"Amazon",2016-02-13,4,"Better than it used to be, and much smoother playing than Apple music, but still leaves much to be desired   Well, one thing I can say is it certainly works much more smoothly than it used to, and the lyrics on-screen feature can be quite a bit of fun, and helpful, but the lack of features like Spotify's old Starred playlist (been awhile since I've been over at Spotify) and the fact that it is missing so many good, standard album tracks or that Amazon expects you to pay extra for them? Really?I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."

They didn't have to, and that's a credit to them.But given that he'd just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free?  Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise.  If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you?  Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now.  Right now?

1305,"Amazon",2014-10-14,3,"No SD card support and some recordings not original   I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just OK since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing."

Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer.  Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there."

1519,"Amazon",2015-06-26,3,"nice selections and features for Prime but poor performance.   Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon took over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all."

I'd suggest that it remembers what my last refinement was (if I was sorting by Artist last time, don't friggin bring me back to Albums every time). Other than that small annoyance it's good.I have Prime so I've got a pretty decent selection of music I've added to my library."

Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."

1607,"Amazon",2013-05-19,4,"Pretty awesome   We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it."

So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms.  The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I'm required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."
1624,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Wonderful!!!   I just absolutely LOVE Amazon Music, and with the added benefit of the Prime Music it's just wonderful!!! It's so easy to use and shop. The songs and albums are very affordable and you can't even imagine all the free music available with Prime. Love it!!!"

1641,"Amazon",2012-12-22,4,"Good  but Amazon could make this a bit better.   Integration is great I love that you can actually stream music from the cloud unlike iTunes match.  Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing.  I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser.  If there was a user friendly desktop interface like iTunes they would have five stars.  Keep working on it amazon you have my business, I hope you continue to develope your  music products."

1663,"Amazon",2015-01-23,2,"Fix this thing!   Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
1664,"Amazon",2016-12-23,3,"Not too bad...   Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."

1678,"Amazon",2014-06-20,3,"Close, but no cigar.   Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music.

1679,"Amazon",2015-07-09,4,"Solid addition to Prime   Not quite as good as Google Play Music as far as subscription services go, but it is not a bad addition to Amazon Prime.

When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage."

1782,"Amazon",2014-11-09,1,"Frustrating   Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I'm extremely irritated with this."

Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player.  The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player.  You can't bypass this anymore.  There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet.  Uninstalled."

2173,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ?   Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer.  My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"

2187,"Amazon",2014-12-17,5,"Nice!   Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC.  I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.[On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]"

2196,"Amazon",2014-12-06,1,"Interesting concepts, but fatally flawed.   I just wish the damned thing would work consistently. I thought it was purely a lack of support for the One Plus One, but it doesn't work correctly on either of my previous Nexus phones.

2224,"Amazon",2014-09-13,2,"Could be much better. I expect more of Amazon. UI anyone?   The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."

Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him.

My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...THE GOOD:*Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.*I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.*Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...THE BAD:*Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.*Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it...*Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.*I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there.

But it works great for me because I use several phones (one for each region I frequently travel to) and it's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them.  Best part of it is I don't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library.  I can just stream the playlist (or artist, album, etc.) that I want to listen to."

The different groups, such as amazon music for walking, update constantly, and I do not have to go to the web site to do it.  Makes listening to the music fantastic. My only problem with this is that I can access movies while travelling outside of the US, but not the music,  You have to download it.  Hurry up and get the musical access also!"

3000,"Amazon",2014-06-19,2,"Prime music is a mixed bag of good and bad   I love the fact that you can access many different songs including playlists.  What  I don't like is that when you use the app and click on recently added, it doesn't sort by artist or album.  I'm not sure how to accomplish this because it is not clear"

3031,"Amazon",2016-11-15,5,"Five Stars   Love all the songs I am able to hear again thank you Amazon"
3035,"Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"OK but could be better.   I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary.  The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious.  The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc.  The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of.  Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61).  I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point.  I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone.  I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."
3036,"Amazon",2015-03-11,2,"lacking   Without Chromecast support this is just another portion of amazon prime that locks you into buying Kindles and Fire TV. It's a lack of flexibility like this that has kept me away from Apple lately."

3103,"Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"BAH! Amazon Music with Prime   I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

3131,"Amazon",2014-11-21,3,"Good Deal for Being Part of Prime   I love that its inclusive in the Prime package, and as the Library grows its getting better all the time. Granted there are some you still need to pay for, the amount included with the Prime package is pretty fair."

The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.If you're Prime, this is a must use!"

We had some music that we bought from Amazon, and some from iTunes. By downloading this App, paying for the cloud storage, and uploading my entire library from one computer, and combining that with music from another PC, we finally have all of our digital music available to play on the Echo Dot.We also needed to agree to become an ""Amazon Household"" which was one of the key ingredients in pulling all of our music together.  So far, we are very pleased with the results."

3952,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"It's alright.  A nice added bonus to Prime members.  But...   Don't expect it to be like Spotify, Slacker or Pandora.  Maybe I haven't the found the feature, but it doesn't seem like this will play songs based on something you're currently listening to.  There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own.  But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs.  I don't know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above.  I would have been a great feature, and I'd give it four or five stars then."

3970,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Replacing Google Music   It doesn't have everything that I have searched for, but I think it is good enough to replace Google Music for me. I wouldn't subscribe to Prime just for it, but it is a nice perk to go with my existing subscription."

4155,"Amazon",2013-12-17,2,"Amazon Cloud is great, but Android app has some killer limitations   I pay $25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I'm very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I've got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.So far, so good.But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:1) It won't download music to your SD cardI bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data).But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloudI was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!3) No gapless playback.Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."
4156,"Amazon",2016-01-29,5,"Love it!   Love all the free prime music! Great for when I go on runs to have my music right there!"
4163,"Amazon",2016-04-19,5,"LOVE the Indie music!!!   All of the different Indie play lists rock! They are all my favorites."

4209,"Amazon",2017-01-01,5,"Five Stars   Excellent App"
4211,"Amazon",2016-03-29,3,"Good content delivery system that needs a better UI   Performance-wise, the app delivers music with good speed and quality, and the prime music selection is pretty solid. The user interface has a tendency to feel clunky and at times counter-intuitive. Search algorithm should be better optimized.  As-is, the system often just displays all the covers available through prime music without mentioning the original artist. This leaves the user wondering if the search went wrong. When someone searches for a song, it should display the original artist first, with track availability (unavailable, purchase-only, or PRIME). It would be nice to see how popular the covers are too as part of the search result."
4217,"Amazon",2014-06-18,4,"Please add Queue system   The prime music is a great added benefit. I enjoy the app, but do not always want to deal with playlists. Please add the ability to select a song and add in to either next or last in queue while playing music."

4642,"Amazon",2016-01-16,2,"Not a fan   App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note).  It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly.  I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke.  The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version.  It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store.  The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it.  Very frustrating and a big waste of time.  Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff.  This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time.  Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify.  ."

I would give it five stars, except that there are some artists and songs that are slow to make it to the collection.  Some of my old favorites from the 70's / 80's / 90's were in my original collection, but then were pulled out (i.e., Neil Young) and not available for ""free"" (I pay for Amazon Prime, so it's not exactly free).Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline.  This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz.  Must have tunes when driving!  I just bought a holder for the phone so that I will be able to hear the music and advance through the selections hands free.Streaming quality is great.

7328,"Amazon",2012-03-14,5,"Love It   I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!I LOVE IT!"

I can access my personal playlists easily. Amazon playlists are just as easy to access, navigate and choose by genre and mood. Even better, if I like a song on one of Amazon's playlists, I can add it to my personal playlist with just a couple of touches. I've found Amazon Music for Android even easier to use than the version for PC. Good job, Amazon."

I cant say how well selection is 4ea but looks like in general theres a ok 2good amt free, including recent releases. Theres also PRIME playlists U can stream or download w/categories from ""rock"" or ""rap"" yr workouts & classical 4reading, soothe baby, etc.1st music app I've had was iTunes so incomparison w/buying everything 4stars.. ITunes does have quite the selection so -1 4that! 2nd app I've used &most recent was Google play so, I'm probly biased but I liked format, listing top songs, related artists, which amazon sorta does &artist mini bio which amazon doesn't. Plus Google play $9.99mo unlimited, so I was inclined 2stay but as Prime member thought I'd check it out. Prime perks R 5star, where else is it free despite limited selection. Miss monthly subscription pymt on Google or any other type app &U got jack 2listen 2even if U bothered downloading, free on amazon so far has proven 2b free."

7916,"Amazon",2015-06-04,3,"WHY IS THE RESPONSE TIME ON THE ECHO APP SO MUCH FASTER?   I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library(134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years).I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist (even with a name like Todd Rundgren) the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."

10405,"Amazon",2013-02-13,1,"HATE this app   HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon."

We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists."

10593,"Amazon",2013-03-28,1,"Use to love it, now I hate it.   This was my ""go to"" music player on my phone.  I liked it more than any other, and I purchased music from Amazon on occasion.  But then it started to say that it couldn't play music on my device.  So I investigated, and Amazon changed the game.  Now you have to pay $24.99 a year for their service.  Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal.  I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone.  That's all.  For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song.  But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music.  It will do.  I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long.  And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song.  I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone."

10865,"Amazon",2011-04-19,5,"Great App, a couple changes suggested   I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player.  I've put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3.  Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.Great updates."

10867,"Amazon",2013-01-19,5,"Music   This is a good app to use use to get songs for your phone and Amazon is fair in their pricing."

10896,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED BUT YET HOPEFUL...   FIRST OFF SPOTIFY (FREE NOT PREMIUM) IS BY FAR THE BEST MUSIC APP.  I KNEW THAT SINCE AMAZON PRIME MUSIC JUST LAUNCHED I WOULD HAVE TO LOWER MY EXPECTATIONS BUT THE SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE THAN I EXPECTED.THE USER INTERFACE IS CLUNKY NOT STREAMLINED LIKE SPOTIFY ETC.  WHEN I CLICK ON A PLAYLIST IN MY LIBRARY I CAN NEVER GET THE PLAYLIST TO PLAY ON MY CELL PHONE...KEEP GETTING MESSAGE ""ERROR...PLEASE TRY BACK LATER OR CONTACT AMAZON.""I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH AMAZON AND THEIR PRODUCTS (PRIME TV, FIRE TABLETS ETC.) SO I AM FOREVER HOPEFUL THAT THEY CAN TURN AROUND WHAT HAS BEEN A DISASTER UNTIL NOW TO EVENTUALLY COMPETE WITH, IF NOT SURPASS, SPOTIFY'S AWESOME SERVICE."
10898,"Amazon",2012-11-22,1,"Doesnt work   I cant get it to work on my new phone. I switched to htc evo and can not purchase downloads."
10899,"Amazon",2017-05-09,5,"works great on my s5   like I said, works great on my s5 phone. but you would think that it being Amazon music it would work on your Kindle. Nope, don't even have it available for download on the Kindle. Go figure. but its nice to have the app on my phone for travel."
10908,"Amazon",2011-05-01,5,"the cloud, the cloud   it's all about the cloud, it's the best thing, well not to mention actually buying CDs from Amazon is cheap and non drm locked"
10910,"Amazon",2011-07-22,2,"The most usefl app ever... hahahahah that was funny...   I hardly ever use it. Most of my music won't show up on it. Its problaby because of how it was ripped. Needs more codec support I guess (???)."
10913,"Amazon",2011-12-31,1,"Not US version.....   This is UK only. Prices show in pounds an no cloud drive access. Worthless and cant uninstall. 18 19 2o words to post????!!!"
10914,"Amazon",2012-01-29,4,"Great product but crashes a lot   Love the amazon mp3 idea.  I put 12k of my mp3s into the cloud.  This software needs more work ..getting there though ..."
10917,"Amazon",2016-07-15,4,"Very Satisfied   I love how it works and the ease of use, however it doesn't have the variety I would like to see. I am pleased with the service overall and my husband recently became a prime member just for prime music. I love that I can use it on any computer/tablet that I can log into my Amazon account on without having to download anything. There is a smartphone/tablet app that I use because it takes me to straight to prime music without going in though my account. I have had other music programs in the past that I couldn't use at work because they required me to download a program to use on my work computer. That is not the case here and I really like that."
10918,"Amazon",2012-07-03,4,"great   The only thing I think it needs is a complete my album option to get five stars. Otherwise, great app."
10920,"Amazon",2012-09-09,5,"Mp3   I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems."
10922,"Amazon",2011-04-01,4,"very good   thinking of switching from iTunes now.  just needs a little eye candy and ui clean up :-) cloud option is very good.  thanks for the free storage."
10928,"Amazon",2014-10-23,4,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums ...   Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I'm not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it's not a big deal.Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
10930,"Amazon",2011-10-31,3,"Moved on   I got away from this Amazon app and moved on to a generic app. Music Search and Download is what I use now."
10931,"Amazon",2016-10-25,1,"There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request but I'm not happy in doing   It wont load into my Droid Turbo 2. There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request that I'm not happy in doing. This is the WORST. I sent a report but no response.Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs."
10933,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"DOES NOT WORK   No trace of this app on my kindle, tech support says to be patient - why should I be patient?  If something isn't ready, don't put it on your website or store shelves.  Bought a kindle fire just to use this app but it doesn't exist."
10940,"Amazon",2016-09-28,1,"Garbage! Will not install   This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem.  Amazon tech can't get it to work either.  This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS.  ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!!  Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
10943,"Amazon",2011-10-18,1,"Bug fix   Crashed at start up and now wouldnt open fix the bug. Got a froze and than black screen. Oh no"
10945,"Amazon",2011-06-18,5,"Nice App   Plenty of storage available for free. I  use it mostly for sharing access to my mp3s between multiple devices. Not sure how well the streaming works or how much bandwidth it consumes, but the are nice options to allow you to limit downloads while using cellular networks, which may keep you from getting an unpleasant data charge from your provider."
10952,"Amazon",2016-05-16,4,"Love amazon music!   Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far,  is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
10953,"Amazon",2016-07-30,5,"A must have for prime members   Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library."
10957,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"Used All My Data...Battery Hog As Well   All of a sudden I have used almost 4GB of data. I made sure the app was set to download via Wi-Fi only and the next day another 2.5GB was downloaded. And the battery drain on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was amazingly slow...until I installed Amazon music and then half of it was gone in half a day with very little use. It appears it automatically syncs with the cloud every 10 minutes without any option for adjustment. Why would I need to sync every 10 minutes? Very disappointing. Uninstalled it from ALL our phones. Please fix these issues!"
10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App   I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10978,"Amazon",2017-03-30,5,"Five Stars   I love my Amazon Music.  It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime."
10979,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"Doesn't work   I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs won't download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
10981,"Amazon",2013-02-23,4,"Cloud Player was mind changer for me.   Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
10983,"Amazon",2017-06-21,1,"Boooooo   Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago"
10985,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money   Use it for dinner parties, for everything! I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money!"
10992,"Amazon",2011-06-30,1,"This program is not just bad its damaging.   I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."

10996,"Amazon",2017-09-25,1,"One Star   Worthless if you can't get the prime member music"
10997,"Amazon",2017-06-22,5,"Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better.   Its waaaay louder than spotify was. I had to max my car out and have treble all the way up to hear songs. Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better."
11001,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"It's music to my ears   One of the unexpected benefits of Amazon prime is the music service that comes with it. Download the Amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files. You can stream them our download them to your phone. They are available as full albums, individual songs, or listen to preselected playlists. Get Amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it."
11003,"Amazon",2013-01-20,4,"Good   This is good app to store most, not all my music (only because I haven't paid the $25 annual fee). Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources (PC, tablet or cell). If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!"
11008,"Amazon",2017-06-04,5,"I love my Prime membership   I'm a music love and as such, will try out everything available.  Amazon is the most recent musical trip I've taken and it might be that I've reached my home for music.  I've been a Prime member for many years and it's paid for itself over and over.  This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."
11009,"Amazon",2016-10-18,1,"New tunes stuck in jail with no key to get out.   Amazon lacks the ability to share files or it hides instructions or directions on how to do it. I just purchased a number of Adele tunes but can't transfer them to my Google play library.  Why?"
11010,"Amazon",2013-02-12,1,"Music only on internal storage?   This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company."

Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there's always a little freeze in the playback when I'm streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I'm really satisfied"
11032,"Amazon",2013-02-13,4,"Amazon MP3 to the rescue   There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train."

11035,"Amazon",2013-06-05,3,"Is constantly ""looking"" for the cloud   The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone."

Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
11048,"Amazon",2013-02-10,5,"Easy access   I love the way I can go either on my phone, or my laptop and search for music etc. I already have an account with Amazon, so everything downloads  instantly, and without problems. If I should have a problem, it is usually very easy to fix."

11654,"Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"Finally went too far   I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."
11656,"Amazon",2013-12-10,1,"no longer a fan   I used to love the app. It used to work well and it sounded wonderful playing in my cars speakers. I used to tell my friends about it but now....not so much. Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely.

11679,"Amazon",2015-01-13,1,"If its not broke, fix it until it is!!   I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available.  I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet.  This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon).  I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists.  I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline.  Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app.  I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays.  But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online?  I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for.  I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work.  My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."

Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy, with side bars expanding,  and extremely difficult to simply look through folders.This is absolutely terrible.

I paid $100 for my fire TV and $50 for the game controller and Amazon issues and update that makes me hunt through nested menus for purchased music that was originally accessible from the home screen. Updates are supposed to make apps easier to use not harder with more fees. If I start seeing advertisements the app I'm gonna demand a refund for my fire TV. The best word to describe the Amazon music cloud is ""volatile"". I literally lost purchased music because Amazon stopped the album. Even uploaded music is subject to the volatility of Amazon's music market. If Amazon made a straight up media player app they would not have a problem. I download everything I buy because I can't trust Amazon to keep it for me."

11715,"Amazon",2016-05-11,1,"An Audiophile's Nightmare   As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music.  Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn't work."
11717,"Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"Luv Everything Amazon   This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH!  I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap.  Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music.  I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music.  Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight??  if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant.  The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device.  If u own the music u can download to ur device  (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data.  And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here).  it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this:  u can download aNY of the music u want.  However, u can only move the music you own.  Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it.  MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage.  Hopefully,  most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer."

11748,"Amazon",2016-11-06,1,"Poor experience with the amazon music software (5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400) for Windows   Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!"

11764,"Amazon",2014-06-27,1,"Wont Work on Older Hardware   Great job. Promote your new prime music and make the player incompatible with older hardware (2 year old phone and first generation Kindle). It has speakers, it has a audio jack, Pandora, Slacker, everything else works on it. Guess I will say screw it to Amazon Prime Music and stick with tried and true music players that don't give me a hassle.Be warned, if you don't like spending several hundred dollars every year to upgrade your tech then you wont like this application because it wont like your perfectly good hardware. Way to be like Apple Amazon."
11770,"Amazon",2017-06-07,3,"Well behind Apple Music app. Hoping improvements will come soon!   The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try."
11774,"Amazon",2014-10-26,1,"I hate it :(   It's cumbersome. It forces updates that don't automatically install on my system so I have to go in and download the entire thing again and install it in order for it to run properly (Windows 7 Ultimate). It doesn't allow me to choose where on my system I want to save the music, and it invaded my privacy before I could choose my preferences/settings by going through all the existing music files on my computer (most of which are NOT from Amazon) and making a playlist for me... While I like Amazon for a lot of other purchases, particularly Kindle books, I'm not buying music from Amazon anymore. Going back to iTunes."
11776,"Amazon",2017-09-28,3,"Nice, but a few usability issues   It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version.  Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list.  I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate.  The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own.  After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again.  After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed."
11782,"Amazon",2016-11-18,1,"As of this moment, the worst music app in the history of music apps.   I used to love this app (when it was still an orange icon).  The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes.  I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes.  It was much easier to navigate while driving.  The latest update ruined that.  It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving.  Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it.  It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums.  So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists.  Ridiculous!Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs.  Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album.  No other songs, just the one song. Go figure.  What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether.  For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics book.  Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book.  I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on.  Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums.  So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.The controls are my biggest issue with this new update.  What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums.  The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone.  Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently.  THAT song is still there.  Everything else is literally wiped out.  I'm done.  I'm going back to iTunes.  Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."
11784,"Amazon",2015-12-16,5,"Cool App   I've used several different streaming music apps.  Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.I like it!  It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever.  I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels.  Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora.  Other than that, I like this app,  I can pause, skip and shuffle.  It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."
11787,"Amazon",2014-06-12,1,"Serious Flaw in App   OK, so i downloaded/installed this app on my Android Samsung S3 and it seemed to work fine. Played music, had all my purchases there, etc. All was good until I wanted to exit the app to avoid it running in the background and thus run my battery down and who knows what else in this day of NSA spying.I tried e-mailing customer service and got no help. I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an ""Exit"" button available in it's menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an ""Exit"" button that shuts down the app.But this app? Nope!That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It took using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.And good riddance.If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I'll reinstall it.Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw."

Using Android app on Samsung S4TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free.  Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.Pros :Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon appManaged playlists are nice, good varied selectionLots of good music in thereCons :Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library - no way to disable this - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again) - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scanNo way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as : - specify download location - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music - disable device scan"

I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the way I would market the service."

It's really a small price.Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway.I honestly don't know what people are so irate about.After all, you get what you pay for.

Locked in playlists! Doesn't use Android's internal playlist database, can't import/export playlists = lock-in to app, waste of my time, total horse s.... 4. User interface is poorly thought out IMO.

It's all right to have on in the background, no different than Spotify, except for one thing. Some of the songs don't sound right. Has anyone else noticed this? Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped."

11839,"Amazon",2016-04-13,1,"This app is OK but it is definitely not user friendly. Very hard to keep musical preferences clear   As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music.But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.First,  the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I  am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud,  Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear,  even my own music!Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player."
11840,"Amazon",2017-07-21,5,"FREE Version is fantastic  Paid version probably even better if you want to spend the extra cash!   Works very well.  Most songs are very high quality and the ones that aren't are sometimes unusual or hard to find live recordings that may not have been released on a large scale.I really, really enjoy this music service.  (and Jenny)Now all I have to do is decide whether to spend the extra money for the unlimited version!"

So I copied a few of my discs to the hard drive and uploaded them. All the tracks said duplicate. Yet still not in the cloud.

The selection is now top notch (if you pay for Music Unlimited) and the app works MUCH better than Apple Music on Android!  Being that pretty much my entire purchased music library is on Amazon Music, Music Unlimited seemed like the no brainer choice for my music subscription service.  So far I have been very impressed and would highly recommend it to anyone!!  The app features full albums, stations, and playlist..  The app is easy to navigate!!  The app is easy to download or stream..  And overall, I have had no issues with the app.. I highly recommend it"
11863,"Amazon",2015-05-20,1,"Not ready for PRIME time   I'm paying for storage of songs and have about 80,000 uploaded. The player is super slow, erratic, and buggy. By buggy, it sometimes can't find songs and it crashes with great regularity. It also has a sucky interface. It is hard to figure out how to do things like build playlists. I know Amazon will eventually get this right, but for now, iTunes is a much better experience. I'd like to see Amazon puts some resources into this especially since it's a major part of Prime and they charged me for storing my music."
11865,"Amazon",2014-06-13,2,"Works on Some Devices, Not Others   Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in ""airplane"" mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."
11867,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Amazon Music Unlimited Review   Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available.  However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to...  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."
11869,"Amazon",2015-08-21,5,"Yup it'll keep me being Prime   Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi.  The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."
11873,"Amazon",2012-10-24,4,"My go-to music app!   UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012.  My how times have changed.  The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music.  If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
11875,"Amazon",2015-06-10,1,"Takes up all my internal memory.   Adding my voice here.  Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB.  Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage.  Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music.  I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it.  Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone.  You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected.  You don't need to hog my internal memory.  I guess you are only for top end phone users.  I can't afford you.Listen from the cloud you say?  Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops.  I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what?  It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone.  Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds.  Amazon, I love you.  But I hate your music app."
11876,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"promising but...   I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved.  There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently.  Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."
11877,"Amazon",2015-12-23,1,"I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle   this is the slowest app that I have experienced recently.  It is slow to load, slow to update, slow to make changes (order of playlists).  I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc.  The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap.  But, functionally, it it terrible.  I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired.  Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware."
11879,"Amazon",2014-11-11,1,"I share a membership and pay half with my 76 ...   I share a membership and pay half with my 76 year old mother. Because it's in her name, I can't access songs that would be free. She has zero use for it. If only one person on Prime can get free songs and apps, we should be able to designate that member ourselves.I also couldn't download my purchase to my phone without it asking me to change my settings to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"". Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet. The general permissions I had to accept for the app were way outside of normal apps, but making general changes to accept unknown downloads is nuts."
11885,"Amazon",2016-11-21,3,"App works well, the upload process (and programs) is horrendously bad.   I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm looking for.I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear.3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive."
11886,"Amazon",2015-07-08,2,"Amazon Music.. it's 2015 and YOU SUCK   How can this app STILL not allow you to save purchased music to an SD card?  How simple was that to program!? OMG..

Being the best online retailer on the web, I was sure that this was the place to let my teen buy music for their Android phone.. until it FILLED UP THE PHONE'S SYSTEM MEMORY!!  You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates (going forward) involves taking out the SD card (periodically), and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!! Don't BOTHER to suggest third party apps that can't GUARANTEE that all album images will move with the mp3s and be accessible by the CLOUD.  Major fail... YOU SUCK.  Sadly a great online retailer will be losing my music purchases due to lousy app."
11888,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon Music sucks.   This app is clunkier than Windows Vista. Heavy, unmanageable, buggy, and virtually unusable are the strong points. At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets. The fact that you're shoving this drek at us tells me you've lost your way. Disappointed? More than you know. Wow."
11891,"Amazon",2017-05-13,5,"Awesome with Unlimited   With Unlimited,  this is now my go to music app!  Spotify does have more of a wealth of playlists, but I think Amazon will continue to improve in that regard."

11895,"Amazon",2015-11-02,4,"Great App; Perhaps More Rare or Obscure Tunes Added to Available Songs   I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I've never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."

This is ridiculous! If one purchases Prime for a household, then everyone in the family should have access to the music. Music was a huge reason we purchased Prime. It was a great disappointment when we discovered only one person in our household could access the music. It made our overall opinion of Prime less attractive for our family."

11903,"Amazon",2012-04-26,2,"I love it, but ...   UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional."
11909,"Amazon",2014-11-02,4,"Great idea but still (in 2014) limited   Great idea but still (in 2014) limited: does not work in Windows phones (no app), tries to show the cover shot of the selection with often hilarious results (minor issue), and limits playlist size, which annoys me because I have classical, jazz and blues in one big file but can separate them in playlists. Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."
11910,"Amazon",2016-08-28,1,"Total garbage   This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show."

So I choose other artists like piano guys, and I do not want to keep saying I do not like the same music on that channel over and over again. I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!"
11918,"Amazon",2014-12-06,4,"I think prime is overrated   The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue.  One minute your movie and music are there.  The next minute they are gone.  without warning.  At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service.  Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers.  The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace).  You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth.  The media selection part of prime  (music and movies)  is barely good enough."
11923,"Amazon",2014-06-17,1,"Cumbersome and buggy   Two primary things about this app.1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised."

I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes).  The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums.  You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library.  I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs.  This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place.  I really hope to see this addressed soon."

Furthermore, it won't let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which isn't why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I'd use it.

Instead, every time I open it I have to wade through Amazons's music to get to mine. Wish I could shift it around and have it always default to MY music instead of always promoting others music first."
11944,"Amazon",2016-05-30,4,"Add Visualizer to Make it 5 Star App   Dear Amazon,Can you please add a Music Visualizer to this app? pretty please? I'd love to play my Prime Music playlists through the tv box on my projector when i have guests (who are usually inpressed by the app's sophistication and music variety) but no one wants to stare at the prime music menu pg all evening. Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda...  undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind....  then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device...  its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)"

Looks like Amazon is pushing people to Itunes with the latest iteration of Music.The prior app was relatively stable and offered music afficionados a reasonable interface for downloading their digital purchases. With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!"

(Then again youtube can be used for free.)Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection."

The ""blue"" interface is horrendous and extremely confusing. Amazon Music app on my Blackberry Z30 phone is taking 3-5 minutes to sync its content after every launch while there is NO new content to sync!!!!  Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation?  Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background?Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.  Has anyone tried navigating Amazon's AWS portal to check the usage statistics? It's like a US Government web site - bloated, confusing, full of unneded noise."
11973,"Amazon",2014-06-16,2,"New update leaves much to be desired   While it is very convenient to have my Amazon music on my phone, this app still leaves much to be desired. The previous version of the app was very good, allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was, I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1) You can't store music on an SD card, and 2) You can't sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it's almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load (even when they're on my device!), I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song won't change (although the song title text and album art will!). It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I'm quite certain it's not my device- I'm using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I'm giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that doesn't really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.Very disappointed, as releasing something this rough is very un-Amazon-like. They should have done more testing for bugs before releasing. Hopefully they will fix the bugs soon with a new update."
11976,"Amazon",2014-03-27,2,"Galaxy 4S   Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased).  I never got past the permissions screen- could not believe how intrusive they have made this app!  So I didn't accept the terms, went back and read the reviews.  There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.  Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app."
11979,"Amazon",2016-02-21,2,"Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work everytime.   I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service.  Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it.  Well, I'm wrong.  My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no.  Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible.  So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app.  The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud.  Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song.  I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play.  What's the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) .  But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."
11980,"Amazon",2015-05-25,1,"DO NOT WANT.   I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!"

As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs.  And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley.  The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable.  It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy.  It won't load.  It crashes frequently.  The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality.  The app is also an enormous resource hog.  It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery.  My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all.  I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.The desktop program is tolerable.  It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that.  I cannot tolerate the phone app.  If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."
11997,"Amazon",2015-08-03,1,"Avoid, unless you can't.   This is one of the worst apps on the planet. It lets you buy, but then won't let you use your media card and will fill up your device over and over, even after you move the files. It's a resource hog as one reviewer mentioned, but you don't have a choice if you want to buy on Amazon with your phone. It sucks, but you may have to install, use, uninstall like I have."

12002,"Amazon",2011-05-03,2,"Removed after Cloud Limits Enacted   I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."

These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!"

When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"

I can only access Recently Played, Recommended Stations, and a couple of other avenues that Amazon tries to force feed me. I have no way to browse the THOUSANDS of songs I purchased THROUGH AMAZON. I can't access My Playlists, nothing.

Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."

One good example is that I can consistently try to download an album i uploaded and every time it crashes the app.  It is constantly laggy and trying to update even though there are no updates to my music library.

Unlike iTunes which only makes purchases available to my iTunes library, Prime will place downloads in both my iTunes and Windows Media Player libraries.  We've found that prices for digital music is better, on average, than iTunes too -- at least on my PC.  If they could figure out a way to put downloaded purchased music in my iTunes library on my iOS devices that would make it even better.  But for now I'll just have to live with syncing my devices with my PC.I also wish the selection of streaming music on Amazon was better.  This is one place where iTunes and their radio service has Amazon beat.One thing that makes Amazon and their Prime Music service stand out from the rest is when we get free digital copies added to our prime library when we purchase CDs on Amazon.  Now I don't have to wait for the CD to arrive and rip it to get it on my portable devices.  Sometimes you can find albums for sale at a cheaper price on CD than if you buy the download only version.I also like the streaming Prime music library.  It's like listening to the radio and we can eventually purchase the songs we like so they can be played offline or after they are removed.  I suppose this will be treated like the Prime Instant Video service where tunes that were once included with our Prime membership will suddenly become purchase only.  If I could count on my favorite songs being available later it would make me less likely to think twice before renewing my Prime membership."

First allow the app &/or music to be saved to the SD card.  When my phone updated to marshmallow it wiped all my music (whether this is an Android or Amazon issue idk), but everything on my SD card was saved. Second, make it easier to download music. I can't afford to burn through my data, streaming music. Last (again going back to marshmallow update), make sure your app is compatible w/the newest upgrade. Since marshmallow I can't update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache & data from both Prime & Google Play Store. This means I need to uninstall the app and will loose all my music on my device because I can't save it to my SD card. If I'm suppose to be able to receive music because I pay for a service I should have the ability to download and save"

Now, everything is incredibly unresponsive, I can't access my offline music in areas where I have no service, and upon advancing to the next track, it takes about 5-7 seconds for the song information to update once the next song starts playing. Also, I used to enjoy being able to swipe my finger from right to left to go to the next song, but you've ruined that too by causing a dialog box to come up every time you touch the album art. I've cancelled my yearly cloud subscription and will be looking elsewhere to enjoy my music. You've destroyed a perfectly good app in what appears to be an attempt to make more money. Congratulations on being counter-intuitive and letting the consumer know they are important as long as they keep their mouths shut and give you money."

12114,"Amazon",2015-01-30,3,"WHY does this idiot app insist on putting downloaded music in DEVICE STORAGE?!   I have been using Amazon Prime Music on my PC since the service was announced. Having purchased a samsung Tab Pro 10.1 I was hppy to find my old friend Amazon Music available for Android. Iinstalled it, and once i figured how to download my favorite albums Iwas in hog heaven, until my tablet suddenly stopped being able to download anything.The idiot app was stashing all downloaded music in device storage, so my puny 16Gb of device storage ws all gone while my 64Gb of SD memory was sitting gloriously empty except for some pictures from the camera and some tunes I'd burned via USB from my PC, which went to sd memory as God intended. This behavior continued despite me moving the app to SD. Happily, bringing up the app's on-device list allowed me to easiy delet about 3Gb of music I didn't really need, so I was able to download a bit more stuff I really DID want with some room left over for apps and whatnot.Since the app cleverly hides the downloads from the outside world, I am unable to transfer the music to a less horrendously unreasonable location. GRRR! Since I spent a very long career as a software developer for a top flight skunk works, poory designed software makes me VERY angry, VERY angry INDEED! If it wasn't for this rabidly user hostile feechur, I'd have cheerfully given this this a 5 rating! I'll be transferring 20 gig or so of tunes from my PC to the SD chip - thank heaven Amazon Music is able to see and use such files.One other small quibble: unlike the PC version, there's no volume control in the app - you have to tweak the system volume. A small thing, but inconvenient."

I have a LOT of other files, some music, some brain entrainment stuff, and this stupid app insists on listing it all, so it basically gets in the way of finding the Amazon stuff when I want to. I want the Amazon app to handle Amazon stuff, and leave my stuff alone."

If there was a way to upload more legally purchased music to the cloud for playback, I would be sold. This aspect of personal music storage is a huge selling point for Amazon Prime Music versus online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have. What I'd love to see is a way to sync or play music from the cloud that I've purchased elsewhere either via cd or digitally. I love the integration of auto rip for CD's purchased on amazon and that makes me purchase cds more frequently because of it."

12132,"Amazon",2014-12-27,3,"Dodgy   If you use both PC and Android devices to stream music from your Amazon cloud, this Android app's limitation of 500 songs per playlist risks truncating large playlists that you have created in the more usable web interface. Twice in the past month or so my playlists have been truncated to this app's limit of 500 songs. I believe this may happen if you have the same playlist open - not even playing, just open - in the Android interface and in a PC interface. It's happened when I've had the web interface up, and it's happened when I had the Amazon Music desktop app up.The most recent update to this app seems to be crashing a lot, with different error codes each time. Exception 94, Exception 182. The newest version no longer displays song length, so if you have the single version, the album version, and the extended version, there's no telling how much time remains til the next track; the best you can do is re-edit the mp3 ""title"" tags on every song for which you have multiple versions.All Amazon Music interfaces - web, desktop, mobile - are exceptionally weak at library management. Updates and improvements are driven by populist demand, ensuring that app development will proceed as an ever-reducing concentric circle for a single constituency - those for whom the greatest feature add is ""pictures of stuff"". Although Amazon sells its Premium Cloud service with the promise that you can upload as many as 250,000 songs in addition to your Amazon mp3 purchases, the functionality reveals that Amazon's target audience resembles the kid on the bicycle on the web login page; a small collection of mp3s organized into playlists about as long as an album, or maybe even a box set.This is the Android app I use the most, more than the rest of the smartphone put together; I didn't really want a phone, I wanted an mp3 player. The unreliability of the Amazon Music app is disappointing. Life was better when Amazon didn't use this app to push its subscription streaming service. Sooner or later a developer will create a library management app that will be able to stream playlists from your Amazon cloud. I look forward to such alternatives."

12135,"Amazon",2014-06-23,4,"This has improved tremendously!   So I have been buying music through this for awhile because, let's face it Amazon often has better prices than Apple. However I have never really liked how this app works.Now we have the addition of Prime Music! Huzzah, the selection of songs is actually pretty nice, sadly you have to listen to it through this player. Which would be ok, but it is not like you can have it build dynamic playlists for you based on your musical preferences, also no function for rating music( not sure why Amazon does not easily provide this in their apps as this would seem obvious). I have been toying with Spotify considering if I want to spend my money on it or not, or maybe Google's streaming service. Amazon's players lack of features and usability does not do well to recommend their prime service. Luckily for them 2 day shipping is always what it is.Also the inability for 2 people to listen to Prime music at the same time is lame.*Update*The service is steadily improving, Would like to see the stations get added to the app as this would resolve an issue with it I have had for awhile. I would also like to see an Android Wear app for this to control playback."

Why is it so?  Because when trying to create playlists, I can't read an entire id tag because it's too long.  If you listen to classical music with the opus numbers at the end of the tag, you know what I mean.  Fix this, and all the other glitches, Amazon, and you get a 5."

Tunes get stuck in the play back too if its playing from the cloud so I just download to device to bypass the cloud. The service of Amazon Music with Prime is excellent.

The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated.

It almost always wants me to re-download and reinstall the app when I buy digital music, and when it reinstalls I often have to restart the app several times for it to recognize that I have purchased music and would please like to download the music.  A while ago, before amazon forced me into using this app to download their music, I used to buy so much more music, but now that the experience is so consistently frustrating, I wait until there are at least a few items for me to buy and I just stopped impulse buying music altogether.  I do like the color orange and think that white text works quite well on an orange background, so the app does have that one good thing going for it, but that's the only good thing I can think of."

I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit.  Then came the support merry-go-round.  My first rep was difficult for me to understand, very slow to understand me and didn't seem knowledgeable which was understandable since he was in Africa.  After getting an American rep, I was no more successful.  I have received two, not one email welcoming me to Amazon Music, so I guess I had registered but still no clarity on the error message. i QUIT.  Too bad Amazon didn't provide the ease of use that they have with Prime video."
12306,"Amazon",2014-12-01,2,"Like the service, Android App rather disappointing   Like the prime service over all, but rather disappointed in not being able to store music on the SD Card. Really have trouble believing that this use case wasn't brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common.  I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card (world readable, 777 all that) is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music (I'm guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there).  All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method won't last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see What's on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."
12312,"Amazon",2017-08-18,1,"Freezes constantly, not worth the frustration   The app on my phone loses its connection and pauses/freezes the music all the time when I'm trying to play my playlists. I don't have this problem with Soundcloud, Spotify, Youtube or other streaming music services so it has nothing to do with the internet connection. It happens almost every time during or after the first song. It's so frustrating and I end up switching to Youtube or another service that I know won't have problems. Not worth paying to have access to unlimited music if Amazon freezes it after one song....."

12315,"Amazon",2014-02-02,2,"Memory Hog   For those who have accumulated a lot of MP3s in Amazon's cloud and want to access them anywhere, this is essential, but it is frustrating that they didn't put more thought into it.  There is no way to set the storage to be the first place it should look - the SD card! If you want to take some MP3s for use off-line, they quickly fill up the main device storage. You have to keep deleting them and downloading them again, or take the trouble to move them back and forth yourself. If they would take the time to fix this, it would be great."
12318,"Amazon",2014-09-26,2,"No SD Support?  Really?   The old Amazon MP3 app automatically stored downloaded music to my SD card, but this new app doesn't even give me the option to do so, which is pretty ridiculous, given that I have a Verizon Elipsis 7 tablet with a 32GB SD card and less than 2GB of internal storage.  Is there any way to revert back to the old app, or is Amazon going to address this issue?  Having read the other reviews here, I can see that I'm not alone.  Please Amazon - it can't be that tough to add SD support, and your customers will be a heck of a lot happier!"

Woo hoo...Since becoming an Android user I've been tolerant of ""good enough"" music synchronization capabilities offered by other applications (including the upgrade/pro version of Winamp and doubleTwist. One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its ""AutoRip"" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an ""Amazon over iTunes store"" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive.

It's virtually impossible to browse anything--your own music, Prime content, the built-in store, anything. For one thing, the ""back"" button barely works.

12417,"Amazon",2011-08-24,5,"Best of the Best   I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says ""Free for a limited time ..."" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have a unlimited data plan)."

Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.  Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists.  There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I don't miss anything.  And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch (yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything.  It's a chore and takes a long time.)  Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres:  I'm a nut about tagging my music.  I will tag my music separating the tag with a "";"" for each tag.  Amazon doesn't recognize this and now I have 736 different Genres.  Useless.Pluses:  You can buy music on Amazon and it's there ready to stream on the app immediately.  If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything (and I mean a lot) in my music library."

The app looks fine, feels fine, but overall is veneer over cheap wood.  It's a bit clunky and goes for jukebox vintagey feel over function.  The app got locked up on trying to upload my music from my ipad.  No option to bypass, only sit there and wait.  Felt like a Microsoft product at Walmart.  I've purchased music and films at Amazon, but no cross-refencing to create suggestions or no ability for you to read a spotify playlist or even take a suggestion from the getgo.  This is clearly a rush job by an asynchronous team who had to take a shelved product to market after it finally passed through legal or something that held it up.So its available, but not fun to use.

Any album with more than one artist contributing (soundtracks for instance) are separated into as many ""albums"" as there are artists in said album. This is ridiculous.

12520,"Amazon",2012-08-09,1,"Can NOT dowload the music I bought onto my external SD card!   I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 on Verizon. The app can ONLY download to the phone's memory (same with my Motorola Droid X), and NOT my external micro SDHC card (where I, like many, store MUSIC/pictures/videos). The music tracks are like 7MB each. And don't blab to me about the Cloud Drive. While that sounds great in theory, with only Sprint keeping unlimited data plans available (I just lost mine in this last phone upgrade), streaming music all the time is not gonna cut it. I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card (using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP). Ugghhhh...... Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

It's not perfect but the basic functionality is there and the delivery of music to my phone so far has been solid. I've had no troubles streaming and fowarding the stream via bluetooth works as well.Mpls. / St. Paul marketSouthern metroHTC Incredible on Verizon 3gThe Good:- Solid performance. No gaps in streaming either during or between songs.- Clean interface. Easy to navigate.- Stream can be forwarded via bluetooth (A2DP)The Bad:- Spendy - I'm hoping that the price get's driven down as adoption with cloud computing takes off. It's true you get the first year free but that's just the hook. After that you're looking at a buck a gig per year basically, or $20 per year. The pricing is also tiered so that you can't just add 5 gigs as you need them, it jumps from 20 to 50 to 100 to 500 and finally 1000 gigs, or a Terabyte. I would very much like to see this model disappear and be replaced with an 'on demand' model where I'm not forced into paying for storage I'm not using.- Auto resume - Currently when a txt message or call comes in the player pauses but does not resume once the txt / call is complete. (Updated 7/12/11 - This has been fixed)- External controls - Currently there is no external controls when the phone is locked. I have to unlock the phone and page over to the app to control the player.I will update as I gain more experience with this platform but I think this is a solid beginning."
12552,"Amazon",2012-09-06,3,"Lacks essential feature   I have this app on a motorola droid 2 and on an Asus Infinity tablet.  I pretty much always play music from my device, but I have tried the cloud streaming on my phone, and apart from a slight delay in starting to play the song (probably due to buffering) it works fine.  I have both downloaded music from my cloud drive and uploaded it onto both devices and both work great.  My one major complaint is that once you create a playlist or add songs to now playing, you CANNOT drag and drop the songs to change the order.  You have to delete the songs and add them again in the order you want.  I usually don't use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to songs in a particular order if they seem to go together well.On my phone, the ability to skip songs or pause without having to unlock the screen is pretty nice, and I will give them credit that it is innovative.Overall, the app has functioned fine and played music fine, but not being able to easily change the order of my songs is a huge drawback."

The selection of ""free"" prime music is limited...and I like old stuff.Seems like everything I want to watch on Prime costs money and the free shipping is not really free since Prime items cost more...the timely delivery is the only benefit.  So....why would I buy Amazon's streaming device to pay to watch video ?  There are better alternatives for music and video service."

Trying to use this app in my car dock is an accident waiting to happen.Speaking of crashes... If you like crashes, this is the app for you! I find that it usually crashes after playing a single song.

12599,"Amazon",2012-07-26,3,"Good app overall, Need support for download destination changes   I have been a long time user of the amazonmp3 app. It works very well for my needs. I can quickly access cloud content, purchase music, download it to my phone, play from the cloud, etc.I need to be able to specify a different download directory. The app won't allow me to. When I attempt to move the content from one location to another the playlist duplicates every individual track. One references the old location (where the file no longer exists) and the other references the new location (where the file currently exists and can be played normally.) I contacted support and they were unable to resolve this problem for me. Their best suggestion was to manually go through and delete out the old tracks, one by one. For anyone with more than just a couple of mp3s downloaded to their device, this process can be very tedious, cumbersome and time consuming.The player works well enough. The music store limits the number of results returned on searches and in category views. This can prevent me from browsing music the way I would like. I would like to see this limit removed, and instead add pagination to allow me to browse more content.This could easily be a 5 star app, but these issues are glaring oversights that impact the overall experience."
12603,"Amazon",2011-04-04,4,"A solid first effort   Out of nowhere Amazon has a very compelling Android music player. Streaming works great and I didn't have any of the hiccups that I nearly always had with Rdio, MOG, Rhapsody, and Audiogalaxy, even on 3G. I think it even autobuffers the next song, which the above apps all failed to do, despite claiming it as a feature.There are a few features that would make it way cooler, though:1. Unify cloud music and device music. This could be replaced by a simple icon for one or the other, and would make it easier to see what you had on each, without flipping back and forth.2. Be able to access your wishlist/shopping lists from the app. Buying music and having it available instantly in cloud player is awesome, but it's a pain to have to go to Amazon.com to pick up the albums that I've already saved in my lists.3. Fix the uploader application for Windows. If you don't use iTunes or WMP, it has to crawl your hard drive and those results are organized by folder rather than tag, and on-drive folder structure is not preserved, which makes it excessively difficult to upload all albums by a given artist."
12604,"Amazon",2016-01-28,5,"Very nice addition to Amazon Prime   Very nice addition to Amazon Prime.  I love it.  I run it on IOS (iphone), Android Tablet, and Windows 10 home PC.  It meets all my needs and allows unlimited skips and no commericals.  It also has a comprehensive selection under Prime.

I finally got this piece of junk app to start working with my PC after 45mins of messing with setting for my firewall, antivirus, and windows media player. Only to find out I downloaded my entire song purchase 3 times (like 150 songs)---guess what!? I cannot remove songs!!! So I have to download 450 songs to get my 150 songs, piece of crap!! Yeah it was my fault for clicking to download my queue 3 times while trouble shooting, but no choice to stop downloading, or remove songs. SUCKTASTIC, MORONIC, SIMPLISTIC, GARBAGE! Plus I read a lot of the other negative reviews, and they seem to be accurate. I only give it 2 stars because right now technically speaking it is working (and I have a 9mbs connection) SO it's only going to waste a few hours of my time."
12803,"Amazon",2011-04-10,4,"Excellent evolution   I've had and used earlier iterations of the Amazon MP3 Application on my android devices before, but the continued evolution - and integration with general Amazon features - is promising and pleasing. Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing (challenging as that might be to represent).This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I'd love to see two additions:1/ integration with the lock screen (ala Songbird)2/ Support for the scrobbling standards (e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers).Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I couldn't see how best to add enhancement requests directly."

Then, when you finally figure it out, the damn app crashes.  Amazon Prime is not worth the money.  I will be cancelling my trial before the 30 days."

12817,"Amazon",2012-08-08,1,"It WAS great -- before they began charging for it   I loved this app, it was great to download all my Amazon MP3's directly to my phone, or providing the ability to stream them if I didn't want them taking up memory. Now Amazon has decided to make users pay $25/year to have as much music on there as you want, or you can keep 250 (Amazon mp3's not withstanding) if you don't want to pay for it.It was my go-to music app, but I don't like restrictions on the music I put on my phone, and I sure as hell won't pay $25 a year to access the music I already paid for or uploaded to my cloud drive on their site. If I'm paying for the extra storage space through Amazon Prime, I should be able to do what I want with it."

Kinda pathetic that it can't cast music to Chromecast audio pucks, or even the Fire TV stick.Bluetooth is a pretty crappy way to connect to good speakers, and has all the problems of limited range, etc.If you use it for headphones only, it should be OK.  But it's not a solution for home audio."

12904,"Amazon",2013-05-11,1,"So much for having to quit buying CD's   I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I DON'T! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?"

Immediately on resuming the music track, the volume is up FULL BLAST for a second until returning to previous levels.

Unfortunately downloading from the cloud player to the local memory was non-functional. App only downloads to internal memory, and the media playing portion only plays media on external memory. Call to Amazon support only netted the advice: ""try calling your carrier"". Surprisingly enough Verizon doesn't employ anyone with an expertise in software written by Amazon, so I have a half-functional app. I supposed that would be worth 2.5 stars if it weren't for the support calls literally laughing me off the call."

I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I don't mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great. That said, until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player, I won't have much use for it.

The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long.

Simple, straightforward and generous. I was hooked. The update that splits the drive from the player reminds me of Netflix's blunder last year. This change has made my accounts confusing and annoying. I'll be cancelling at the end of my subscription. The future is supposed to be easier, not unnecessarily complicated. Sorry Amazon.

The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card. Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage."

The player is playing, as it shows the track progressing, but no sound is produced.

Total BS imo.This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I'll be here another half an hour.Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a) the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b) when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can't minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can't close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I'm looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer.

13778,"Amazon",2011-03-31,3,"UPDATE:  FIXED (was ""A music player that can't play music.  Seriously?"")   UPDATE - ATTENTION EVO 4G USERS:  It turns out (after much online research today) that the issues I was experiencing were unique to the HTC Evo 4G, and were the result of a software update that had been pushed out to Evo users earlier this year.  Apparently this update had changed HTTP and RTSP streaming settings/configuration in a way that affected certain apps--in this case it rendered the Amazon cloud player completely useless.Interestingly, Pandora was somehow never affected by it, and so I hadn't noticed the problem until now.  Go figure.Anyway, the issue can easily be resolved by contacting Sprint Technical Support (1-888-211-4727) and asking the rep to apply the work around listed as 'HTC EVO 4G (A9292) - UPDATED 2-1-2011: Streaming multimedia applications receiving errors on software version 3.70.651.1' in Sprint's device portal.  I did this, and when I finally got to a tech support rep, he immediately knew what I was talking about, pushed an over-the-air fix, and 5 minutes later I was streaming from the Amazon mp3 cloud (over 3G) without any issues at all.It works perfectly now.  Sweet.  I'm upgrading my rating from 1 star (when I really meant 0) to 3 stars.---- previous review -----:This review is specific to the new ""cloud player"" functionality of the app.  Two words:  utterly useless.  I would honestly give it 0 stars if I could.I'm on an HTC Evo (Android 2.2).  Regardless of my connection--WiFi, 4G, 3G--I continually get the same ""Network Error"" when trying to play anything at all in the app.  It just doesn't work.  All other network-dependent apps on my device are working perfectly fine, while the Amazon MP3 player fails.I wouldn't even consider this alpha-quality software.  Did this thing even go through QA at all?"
13779,"Amazon",2011-03-28,1,"junk   bloatware junk on my EVO soaks up memory, something like this should only run when you use it.don't get it, besides there are so many apps that don't run in the background out in the world that you can listen to or download music from."
13784,"Amazon",2017-06-15,3,"Amazon Music Could Be Better   I do like the app, however, it has a major glitch which is really annoying.  The app requires an Internet connection to play your music even it is already downloaded to your device.  How it comes?  This is a simple function that can be controlled in the code."
13787,"Amazon",2017-07-04,4,"👍   There r several artists & songs on here that I haven't found on other music apps..the only issue I have is when I touch the 3-dot menu button on the rt side of the song to set it as the next song played,it changes to that song & interrupts the song already playing"

I have to tell you, I was very surprised at the amount of stations associated with the network and the quality of the audio.  I'm going to purchase a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker and now I can stream radio stations to it as well because of the app.  And, it was free, so how can you go wrong?"

13861,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-30,3,"Core engine works great, finding/tuning stations not so great   The core engine works great, never skips, even with relatively low bandwidth connections.  However, I hate that it forces you to link to facebook or twitter just to bookmark stations as favorite.  I have no need to tell all of my social media what I'm listening to.  Then, the system that's left to merely search a station is clunky, inefficient (huge icons per screen), etc."

It is great to hear songs from some of my favorite radio stations and even find new artists. I have found two new radio stations because of this app. It is easy to use, free and works great on my Kindle Fire (in which, I use it every day). The only thing is I wish it had the ""last songs listened to"" feature like the website has. Other than that I think the app is all around great for what it does."
13873,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-25,4,"Seamless and accurate   I love this app. Iheart is perhaps not as diverse as others, but i don't care. Too many people think they need to be bleeding edge music hipsters; sometimes i just wanna hear Justin, Imagine Dragons and Jay-Z. You don't need, to hide, people. Be happily lazy, let a sophisticated algorithm(misspelled?) pick your music. If you don't like the pick, skip it! FREEDOM!!!"

I know that by listening I'm willingly submitting to Clear Channel's hive-mind brain conditioning, (that's a joke, folks, I just think they control a looot of the media & what we hear, already).

The sound quality is good and continues to play with minimal buffering problems. Only really issue I have, and this could be with the channel I listen to, is that it seem there are about three or four commercials that are played every break.

The stations play well enough, but there is no record, pause, rewind, etc.  Also, while I haven't checked exhaustively, the station list appears to be only Clear Channel.

This is a great radio/song app. I am not sure about those reviewers who said you needed a Facebook account for this app to work, but I was able to rate songs, create radio station, save stations, etc. all with using an email address and password (no Facebook account). I chose not to get daily emails upon sign up so I don't get spammed. I think I like this better than Pandora because I hear more variety and less repeats as well as newer artists. Thumbs up!!!"

Overall great app, besides the skip limit. Only negative comment here."

It's really easy to use and stays playing while you move on to other apps. One suggestion would be a rating system for likes and dislikes instead of thumbs up to be more intuitive. Great app that I use daily."
14158,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-07,5,"I love the selection...   I have this set on some of my favorite genres so that every time I open it, it goes right to the last station I was listening to. Be aware that if the station has advertising, you will be listening to it, too. It is only remotely similar to Pandora, which is where you create your own stations. That may be a possibility on this app. But for now, I enjoy the stations I have chosen and saved. Enjoy!"

I like Pandora as a source of music online, but IHeart Radio has more variety and a better catalog of big band, jazz and standards. I would have given IHeart a ""5,"" but sometimes it is a little slow in identifying the current selection, and occasionally doesn't identify it at all. Other than that, it's a ""5."""

14492,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-12,5,"Better than Pandora!   I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it's better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora, when you're first starting out and you want to make your own station, you can't just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not, it's going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it'll give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that's it. Mind you I'm not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it's best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."

15615,"iHeartRadio",2014-11-03,4,"recommended   In my opinion it's WAY better then Pandora. It adjusts your radio to your style and I like it. Although they should not add the selected genres to your station list. I don't like that"

After reading a few (like 12) reviews on the radio I am willing to pay $119.00 for.  Come to find out it won't pick up iHeartRadio!  What's up with that?? Do I have to pick a ""radio station"" first THEN buy a radio Just to receive the station of MY choice? That's crazy stupid.  I love iHeartRadio, here at my computer and I have used Whole house FM transmitters in the past to get the music off my PC to any FM radio and listen outside.  Having a Wi-Fi radio with iHeart would be perfect.  I'll keep the app on my pc and use it here and keep looking for a radio that will pick it up and use it out there.

Biggest reason - IHeart sounded great (via home surround sound system or phone) - in fact better than same stations tuned through receiver.  Then 6-8 weeks ago stream quality was REDUCED by more than half.  Sound quality is now horribly muffled and garbled, with constant feedback/hissing/static in background.  The quality is far too poor to listen too.  There's nothing left to heart about this app..."

18677,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-17,1,"This should be called I Hate Radio. It's junk. but you have to use it.   The fact that stations force people to use this POS makes me hate it even more.  I used to enjoy their stations via TuneIn Radio (5 stars, mobile radio done right) and these morons decided they didn't want to play well with others.This app is buggy. Takes *forever* to load. It has memory leak issues. It throws up stupid ads that mean one wrong touch and it's changing stations. It someone thinks it's lost it's connection. All sorts of BS.They tout it as popular. This app sucks. It's only popular because it's the only way to listen to some stations online.Rather than compete and make a better mobile radio product, they chose to be jerks and make a crappy one and not let anyone compete.Install it if these dolts bought one of the stations you like to listen to. It is or soon will be the only way to listen to them on your mobile device.  Prepare to be tracked and force fed ads, too.This is not a app written for a great user experience. This is an app written to track you and what you listen to and to make more ad revenue for these idiots at ClearChannel and Cumulus.  They're strategy is seems is to acquire stations with good content, micromanage that content so it's not as good as it was before, and then play gatekeeper with how to listen to it and force you into a sub par, feature poor, privacy exploiting, profit high experience."

I travel extensively and found this app needs a very strong internet at all times. I did find it irritating when  I would dislike a song or artist I would get bombarded by other songs from the same artist. I may be the only human on earth that does not like like Prince and Madonna, but after disliking every song that came up it would seem clear that I do not wish to hear their music. I do love the music from the 80's, however those two are not everything. If you could make the app easier to customize  l try it again. Thanks."

25151,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-08,1,"Would not let me listen   I tried to create an account, but it would not let me because they do not service my country (currently on vacation in Turkey). This should not matter if I have an internet connection as the point of this app is to listen to radio over the internet. When my account creation failed, I continued into the app without one. Here I was given a good selection of stations, but the only one I was allowed to listen to was a Russian news station."
25152,"iHeartRadio",2016-04-18,3,"Pure streaming, but privacy invasion   The app is very good as far as connection goes, but issues with privacy. Today, most apps don't charge you, but either gets personal information or relies on you buying in-app items instead. This app allows you to choose any station, by picking a genre, then selecting a station within that genre. All together, it's a great app, but it requires a lot of private info. I would recommend blocking your private info. when this app is installed, which should block information that this app can receive. You can delete the app to get to that information back, and then block and re-install the app. This app requires e-mail, so if you don't have one, create a fake e-mail for ads."

I use it on my kindle fire and its awesome! I seriously think If u love music, you would get this free,cool, app."

25259,"iHeartRadio",2012-10-06,2,"Good but have to censor!!!   My 11 and 5 yr old daughters love Justin Beiber, so I entered that in for the type of music to play.  Our girls can only listen to the app when either my wife or I are present.  Thankfully we have that rule because some song came on with all sorts of profanity, that should not have been included in the Justin Bieber genre.  Dropped Pandora for the same reason.  I don't know why all these artists feel they need to have vulgar lyrics in good songs.  I am as far from ""prude"" as one can imagine, but if there is a chance that kids may hear it, it should not be played on this app."
25260,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-22,2,"way better then a mp player   I can enter a song from when in high school and find it mostly. My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music."

My kindle won't download the player from Air1 which made me panic cause I was needing my Christian music.  A couple other players that I tried wasn't near as user friendly.  Love that I found it on amazon so I can now do more multi-tasking.  :)"
25278,"iHeartRadio",2017-03-15,5,"I love the music choices.   I like that I can pick out an artist and hear otrher artists from the same genre that I might not have thought about wanting to hear. I think there is more variety in music from a station I have selected than other apps."

25287,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-06,5,"Great   It works perfectly, you need a face book if you want your stations, if you don't like that then get over it and don't download the app. It's reasonable for them to request Facebook because it helps keep the app free because they don't have to host the login and always makes the app faster."
25291,"iHeartRadio",2012-07-30,4,"messed up   it was working fine then all of a sudden it just started saying loading and it would sit like that for like an hour then it would bring up my options to delete something or look at lyrics or bio so I uninstalled it"

25308,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-11,2,"not hearting it!   After using only 4 ""thumbs down"" options I was cut off from making any other song choices other than being allowed to skip to next song. It also took some time to load today. I waited 7 minutes, retried and then finally gave up. I loved it when it was working, but got really frustrated with the rest. I will keep at and see if I can't find harmony with it somehow!"
25309,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-24,1,"SUCKS   They upgraded iHeartRadio and it sucks! The new version is worse than the old version. They should have just stuck with the old version. The new one always pauses,  then says the application isn't responding then asks you to force close the application. But whatever,  I'm not telling you what to do. Choice is yours."
25313,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-13,5,"I Heart IHeartRadio   I listen to this app everyday.  I have it both on my android phone and my Kindle Fire.  I love being able to listen to most of the local stations out of the car while I'm waiting for an appointment or grocery shopping.  I also listen to a few national stations as well.  It's also nice to be able to listen to your local station while on vacation away from home."
25321,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-11,5,"Awesome!   Works great on my amazon fire! Love all the stations you can set up, so Dar it's better than Pandora!"

Hey I start looseing stress, (if you know what I mean) If I'm in a 60's mood I tune into some jams I haven't heard since I was a little girl.

You do NOT need a Facebook log in to use this app. When you first log in, you can click on ""Maybe Later"" at the bottom of the screen and it'll take you directly into the app. So, quit hating on Facebook to make people think this app is a waste of their time. This is an AWESOME app! Download if you enjoy radio."

25354,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-17,5,"Love this!   I had to find a new radio app when my old station got bitchy with their licensing bulls*** and I couldn't listen to them on TuneIn Radio anymore. So I found IHeartRadio and it works awesome. Use it pretty much every day on my 1st gen Kindle Fire while I'm working out. Plays in the background while I use a timer app to do 1-min HIIT rounds of weightlifting."
25355,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-07,2,"Not as good as could be. But okay.   I have set up several of my own ""stations"" but have not been real happy with the repetitiveness of certain songs. Seems like it focuses on just a couple of the artist's songs and replays them fairly often without digging deeper into the catalog. I wish it had more features and that the streaming rate could be checked. Also, a record button would be nice."

25361,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-20,2,"Was great, key word being was   Being abroad Pandora doesn't work on my Kindle so I could listen to a radio station from home when I went to bed. 1) said station NEVER worked so I found another station. 2) it used to play after I shut the kindle's screen off, now it stops.  The whole point of downloading was so I could listen to a radio station from home and feel close to home."

25385,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-19,5,"iHeart or Pandora?   iHeart or Pandora? I know it's hard to choose so here's a small summery.  iheart radio has many stations based on genre, where you want to hear it from, and you can create your own stations with commercial free included and Pandora has all that but you have to pay $5.00 and skips too. Now you decide."
25386,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-03,4,"best music app ever   I love this app, you can listen to free music and the music doesn't take up any space!

25654,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app!   I love so many features about this app.  The custom radio stations one can build are excellent.  Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.  This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.  Thank you for making this available"

I put a station into my favorites and cannot figure how to get rid of it  I went on line and asked I heart radio how to do it, but it has been at least 5 days, so I guess I am not going to get an answer.  But in general it is very nice."

25723,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-24,5,"Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora!   I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? It's free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can't say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can't listen to stand up comedians, and I can't figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I'm stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I don't listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I didn't think it was an app problem. It's smooth, doesn't take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"
25725,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,5,"Great app and the execution so far has been flawless.   So far this streaming radio app has performed flawlessly for me.  Unlike other apps that perform on occasion this app has been reliable and I appreciate the variety of genres available.  Love it!"

I especially enjoy that it automatically created a station made up of songs I had at one point or another given a ""thumbs up"" to.  I absolutely love it!"
25780,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-16,4,"overall good app   Pretty good app, lots of radio stations to choose from. Unlike what others said, you do NOT need a facebook account to use this (maybe this was the case in the past, but not aymore). I signed up just using my email, which I didn't mind.My only issue with this app is that it can crash sometimes on my Kindle Fire when trying to open it. Other than that, it works great. Other good radio apps are Pandora and TuneIn Radio (live stations)."
25784,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-26,5,"Hello iHeartRadio, good-bye KFLD talk radio!   This app turned out to be a blessing.  My home town Talk Radio station, out of the blue, dropped the Sean Hannity radio program from their line-up. My calls to their office go unanswered.  It made me question their motives.  So I looked on the internet and found iHeart Radio.  I'm 60 years old and this app is very user friendly, I have no trouble with it.  I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio, in New York City, of all places (I live in WA State),  I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle, or my computer and even on my Windows phone.  Love this app.  So for me its Hello iHeart Radio, good-bye KFLD talk radio."
25786,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-21,5,"best   This app is good I have it on everything. Listen to it all the time. Some times it tAkes long time yo load but other then. that it's great"
25791,"iHeartRadio",2016-05-26,5,"Able to live stream some local radio stations   This is the best app for streaming live radio broadcast throughout the US. I love listening to different cities DJ's, preform and entertain the audience. I'm able to customize my own radio station with my favorite artist and groups. I like the idea of listening to the app without giving any personal information such as name and email address. This also limits my access on the app like voting, liking etc, but I'm Okay with that.This is a free app for purchase via download and install."
25792,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-04,5,"I just love this app   I just love this app.  I put on my favorite station while I'm exercising, and the time just flies.  I love The Beatles station, which is what I happen to listen to while I'm on the elliptical, and the mix of songs they play is fantastic.  I guess I can only speak for that station at this point, but for that one alone, it is worth the download.  I also listen to some of the ""talk"" shows, but there are a lot of breaks in the show for commercials about the show itself.  I don't think it has anything to do with the app because I've listened my favorite show on regular radio, and there are A LOT of commercial breaks.  At least you don't have to listen to commercial commercials, but it is still frustrating.  I'll have to explore some more music stations, but so far, I couldn't be happier.  I hope iHeartRadio keeps The Beatles station.  They are showing it as ""celebrating 50 years"" of their music, so I'm wondering if the station will disappear at the end of the year.  I sure hope not."

I have iHeart radio on my android phone and kindle fire table and it works great....Also love that there are rare to NO advertising......  Thank you Love this app!!!"
25814,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-21,5,"Better than Pandora   I like how there is usually one commercial when you start a new station, and none after that. The mix of music and ability to change the dial for familiar, mixed, or unfamiliar music is awesome and has lead me to some bands I've never heard of (which is rare for me). I like the option to listen to stations from my hometown and the places I've traveled. I use iHeart Radio every day at work, it gets me through my day and has a station for every taste!"

25822,"iHeartRadio",2017-07-07,1,"Difficult   Where do I start? As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I didn't even choose, it's super slow, and recently it's been telling me I can't UAE it because something from my app store wasn't updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it's not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I'm better off deleting it."
25824,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,3,"It's okay as long as you like the programming   If you enjoy listening to your local Clear Channel radio stations, you will probably like this app.  You also gain access to numerous other Clear Channel radio stations around the country with various programming formats and genres.  The limitation is that this is pretty mediocre programming.  I'm not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music being programmed.  No matter what the genre, corporate radio manages to play music that all sounds the same.  Since radio plays homogenized sounds, recording companies record music that all sounds the same.  Pretty boring stuff.To be fair, I've not sampled every single radio station offered on this app.  I am familiar with the local stations (typical of the music described above) and what other stations I've sampled seem to have the same programming.  So, if you like this type of music, you'll enjoy this app."

No worries about static or guessing what you found while flipping through the stations. You see the station and know exactly what you want to hear. I now listen to Christian K-Love or the Fish while going to sleep at night. There is a sleep timer and an alarm built into iHeart Radio. If there were 10 Stars that is what I would give to iHeart Radio.Thank-you.Sincerely, Linda Clark-Koball"

Thanks for making something as unique and a awesome app that has every single type of music, it has a variety of different elements that make it better than Pandora.Thanks again  Ryan D. DuffyP.S. I need to add that the Amazon Customer Service Reps answering the phones (anytime day or NIGHT!) Are so professional, personable, and fast. Every time I've had an issue with my Kindle, Amazon has called me immediately and done everything they could to not only fix the problem but they show you thing's you may not of known about your Kindle and how to maneuver the apps and programs to make it suit your every day needs. They've never got impatient, sarcastic, or acted like someone needing help is a waste of their time. They are genuine and I can't say enough good things about my experiences. I myself am in the Customer Service industry and when someone treats me like there talking to a friend not a customer I want to continue to use and purchase whatever I may need from them and tell all my friends, family or business how great and easy Amazon is.

I tried Spotify for one day and realized that if I pick a genre, probably 30% of what they stream is explicit content that I could NOT take off. The first thing I checked on iHeartRadio was if I could deny explicit content, and I could. I'm telling all of my decent, clean minded friends to go with iHeartRadio!"

I still prefer the musical experience of Pandora better, but the option to listen to broadcast Radio is somewhat attractive. One thing that became a frustration was the enormous amount of commercial minutes aired each hour on broadcast Radio. After listening to Pandora for several years I became accustomed to commercial free music. I don't care to listen to 20 minutes of commercials every hour."

It sure is a lot cheaper than going out and buying the CD's!"
25957,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-21,4,"I use it a lot!   I can find so many great streams, many of my favorite radio stations and local ones I didn't know existed. They even have talk shows! I find myself listening to Science Friday all the time.Their personalization is fantastic! If you have ever used Pandora, you may be familiar with how far off ""similiar"" they can track. iHeartRadio quickly adjusts to your likes and dislikes. I have found many more artists that I enjoy but have never heard of through this app.Only downside is that I can't view individual songs that I have favorited in the past. It may just be me, but I am pretty good at navigating software."
25959,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,2,"Not as Advertised but it's free   The pop-up ad on my Kindle Fire said there were hundreds of radio stations.  So far I've found about 6 different KISS or KIIS FM stations from various large cities and none of them play any of the music I want to hear.  I'll probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I'm not hopeful.  At least the ap (and the usage) are free so I've only wasted my time at worst.  Note - I thought each radio station had to have a unique call sign but apparently things have changed with the internet age."
25976,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-19,4,"enjoying Iheartradio   I wish I could get more local stations.  I listen to Cleveland and Houston because they have the programs I want to hear.  I live in Oregon.  Also when I click on Elvis Radio or Beatles radio, I wanted to hear them, and only one in 3-10 songs is what I wanted.  I have learned you have to ""program"" the stations to eventually play what you are wanting to hear.  I thought Elvis radio would play Elvis.  No so.  the first 10 songs you might get 3 Elvis then not again for 10 or more songs.  BOO!  It is a fun oldies station, but not what I was expecting.  I am working on ""programing"" it now but takes a while.  Same with the other stations, Beatles, etc."

25999,"iHeartRadio",2012-03-31,3,"Not very good.   The iHeartRadio app is okay, but not very good. The custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to Pandora or Slacker. The app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds. The interface is fast. Too fast. If you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly. There is no way to undo it if you do. If it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app is not useful. If you want to listen to the real stations, I would recommend this app. If you just want the custom stations feature, I would recommend Slacker, Pandora, or Jango instead."

Started getting a white screen that rapidly turned to an unending black screen.  This won't work unless I used with the 1st loaded station at least I remembered where the pause button was.  It was a nice alarm clock replacement until I received my new owner from Amazon today at least.  Removed today because I wasn't able to delete the alarm I set.

Then, I'll switch over to one of My Stations after work to hear Disturbed or Pantera.I love the Sleep Timer feature, too, and use that when I travel and have a tough time falling asleep. Falling asleep to music just works!My only gripe ... I really like the Thumbs Up/Down feature for songs. However, I don't think the DJs are actually paying attention because I hear the songs I don't like every single day. There are millions of songs out there... we can hear more than Madonna and Adele every once in a while."

Or you can go to the &#34;Perfect for&#34; page to see what music is good for at the time. I think a lot of people request this app also. Plus, you can keep the music playing while at the home screen, when you are reading a book on your device, when you turn your device off, or just playing a game. I think this is a perfect app for any age and person. There is also a sleep alarm and a alarm to wake you up.

It shows you the song, artist, and album cover when they play a song. Also, you can create a custom stations and set a timer for how long you want the radio on. The recent thing added is radio alarm.

First of all when you turn it on you get a 30 second ad which you cannot skip. Secondly, your last station may or may not be on the app without searching for minutes at a time. And finally when you go to rate the app at the Apple store guess what happens? If you give it a low rating the review mysteriously gets immediately rejected! Hows that for keeping all reviews positive! This type of dishonesty and unethical conduct is pretty much what clear channel used to be accused of.

26324,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-03,3,"90 minute repeats - just like their radio stations   I was hoping for more when I finally signed up for a 'IHeartRadio' account, but after 6 hours of listening today (while repairing some equipment) I figured out that they repeat songs every 90 minutes just like all their radio stations. When you start hearing repeats you need to go reset your starting point.Considering the amount of music available to an 'online only' music service, it astounds me that they have to repeat somgs after only 90 minutes. (I thought that about broadcast radio too but got over that pretty quickly.)So I will use them occasionally but it is not the 'one place' to hear music."

I am not interested in listening to someone else's choices on the existing stations so I created my own. The most aggravating feature is the ""rate song"" function. Despite having told the app that I don't like or want songs from a particular artist, that artist still regularly appears. The ""rate song"" function also does not seem to recognize the genre of songs I select that I want to hear. Also, I have not found a way to suggest artists for the venue. Has a long way to go before it replaces Pandora."

While I used Facebook to register, it does support an e-mail alternative. I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said, the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can't receive locally.

I would recommend this app out of Pandora or Slacker. It seems the most user friendly. And it's great for school or something else.

26582,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-24,1,"USED TO be may favorite app.  Now, it doesn't work.   I use this a lot (or rather I used to).  It was my favorite Kindle app.  The app has an alarm that turns on my favorite morning station at 7am every weekday.  I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening (as I worked around the house) until lunch time. (Both are News/Talk stations).  My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem (""Daaaad...  my Kindle isn't working right..."").Several updates ago (about a month or so), it just stopped working.  When it does turn on (it's not reliable as an alarm anymore), it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing.  I have to close the app (or stop the station) and then hit play again.  It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked.  Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I don't really use my Kindle Fire HD.  Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest version(s) just don't work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it's not the station.  The previous version didn't do it, so I don't think it's my Kindle (besides, other radio apps and Audible all work fine).  If I switch to PC, it seems to work (no perfectly, but mostly) fine.  I'm sure it was an unintended consequence of a new feature or fixing some other problem, but THIS APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW.  :("

26621,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-27,3,"Like the APP, hate the commercials.   I love the convenience of being able to listen to the radio shows, I would otherwise be missing. However,  the commercials are brutal. Sadly, I'm use to commercials,  they have unfortunately invaded everything. But if I have to listen to a countdown of the top songs by Stone Temple Pilots one more time, I think I might shoot myself. The countdowns annoy me so much, I usually just end up turning it off by the first or second set of commercials."
26626,"iHeartRadio",2017-07-13,5,"You should download   It is awesome offline bet you need a account or a Facebook account"
26627,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-01,3,"Thumbs down means thumbs down.   Overall this is a nice app for listening to music. What gripes me the most is that I will see songs that I have disliked keep repeating. The app also doesn't suit my eclectic taste in music. Once I start to get a radio station with a good amount of my favorite music, I increase my variety only to get songs that 70% of the time I end up disliking."

It is not always live, but a good app for music overall."

Not only that. but if I have friends over...who skip songs ....next thing I know I lose my skip privilege for 24 hrs.  I wonder what she will say if I continue to ask to skip......Although I appreciate the free music...its not playing anything in the same Genre that I originally asked.  Maybe the first few songs...I was listening to Classic Rock songs, now some Jazz....and I cant skip.  Thanks."

27137,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-05,1,"Live LOUD, Play HARD   Boycott all things Clear Channel owned.  Clear Channel took away the ONLY rock station in Atlanta and replaced it with yet another bubble-gum pop station.  Atlanta already has at least FIVE other stations JUST like it.  They took away Project 9-6-1 leaving countless Project Family members without a radio home.  Clear Channel is a greedy corporation who blatantly refuses to listen to its customers and is only interested in filling their pockets with money.  Do what's right and help us Project Family members get our station back.  Don't download this app!  We're not asking for a whole lot.  We just want to rock on.  Is that so much to ask for?To Clear Channel:  Screw you!  Your ways of marketing are horrendous.  Keep your customers in mind.  Bring back our Project 9-6-1 and leave us the flip alone.  Take that bubble-gum pop crap station off our rock station!  If you think our anger will just fizzle out and fade away, you are horribly, horribly wrong.  The longer you go without listening to us, the harder we will fight back.  We live by one simple rule.  We live LOUD and we play HARD.Keep rocking on Project members!"

Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it.  The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??"

It's wonderful.Mozart to Joe Walsh to Muddy Water. What a way to listen to uninterpreted music all day long."
27672,"Pandora",2015-11-15,4,"Very Nice   Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)"
27677,"Pandora",2015-11-03,2,"went wrong since last update -.-   Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."

Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that's not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it & esp at no cost."

When I downloaded it on my new Droid XX, I found it very annoying because the ads out number the music.  I found the monthly fee to avoid the ads to be twice as high as it should be.  In the past I paid $15 for a subscription."

I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it's gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening. But last year it was $3.99 a month, and now it's bumped up to $4.99 a month. Uh... no thank you."
27764,"Pandora",2013-06-16,5,"Lots of music fun!   Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to ""like"" and ""dislike"" songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
27767,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"Great app.   I still love pandora!I have prime, and google play.  but I still use pandora about... 1/3 of the time.  it's nice to have it totally on autopilot!"

27783,"Pandora",2014-03-13,3,"Good, but unfortunate commercials   I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I don't like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear.  For example, on the Radio for Kids station, there is an egg donation commercial that comes on often that has spurred odd questions."
27791,"Pandora",2013-03-01,5,"Great!   This is a great app for the tablet and phone. It is by far the best way to stream music."
27793,"Pandora",2013-02-05,5,"Fits my Moods   Pandora is great because I can choose the type of music I am listening to according to my ""mood for the day."" When I am studying I can listen to smooth jazz, when I need inspiration I can listen to Rich Mullins, when I am feeling mellow I can listen to James Taylor, when i need a lift I can listen to Big Band or Beach Boys. The songs are varied and fit the genre I choose."
27799,"Pandora",2016-05-17,2,"chharge for music?   Thought music was free like Nook.  Unless I missed something, you needed to add to ""cart.""  What's with that?  Am I wrong?"

27843,"Pandora",2016-02-03,4,"Upgrade if possible   If you are able to afford Pandora One it is worth it! Regular Pandora is frustrating to listen to with all the commercial interruptions..just my opinion"
27846,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   It's a good app to use"
27847,"Pandora",2013-07-24,5,"Great music   I use pandora in the car, on my phone, on my Kindle while reading, on my PC while while writing, as well as through my TV when I'm not watching a program. I especially like the fact that I can select a group of entertainers and shuffle the music so I get a variety of styles and performers. Only rarely do I feel the need to skip a particular song."
27853,"Pandora",2014-01-01,3,"Decent   Pandora is a FREE music streaming app. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros :Free music.Free account.You can sign into your account on any device .Cons :Takes WiFi.Cannot select individual songs to play.Cannot skip very many songs every hour.Hope this helped you ! :)"
27865,"Pandora",2014-01-19,5,"Have always loved Pandora   I loved Pandora radio before Pandora radio was cool!!  when I first listened to Pandora my peers had not heard of it yet; now I don't know too many people that don't listen to it"
27872,"Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Pretty cool!   The variety is cool but it's so confusing for me. Hopefully I'll get used to it cause it seems like a really cool thing."
27875,"Pandora",2016-05-16,1,"So so   Fair, not very user friendly"
27878,"Pandora",2016-11-21,4,"Four Stars   I really like Pandora. The only thing is I would like to have more skips available."
27879,"Pandora",2017-01-14,3,"Not worth the money for me.   It's O.K., but doesn't have near the catalog of different genres as Spotify."
27891,"Pandora",2015-08-29,5,"great music app   Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before."
27893,"Pandora",2014-11-25,5,"Don't mind it!   The only negative thing, to me, about this app is that I don't get exactly what song I want, but I don't mind it! It makes think about new music! I love it so much! I would recommend this app to all people who love music and like to break molds!"
27894,"Pandora",2012-10-10,5,"Great Music (because you choose it yourself)   I have a very eclectic mix on my station (I subscribe to PandoraOne, but the app is a free download); you can give a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" on any song, and, if you don't like it, will probably not hear anything too much like it again.  I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."
27897,"Pandora",2017-10-31,4,"Four Stars   I like it just wish it didn't have so many ads."
27900,"Pandora",2016-04-28,1,"Samsung 3g   App is fine but the latest update will not update/install.  Have tried it many times and it just stays on install pending forever."

27905,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music   I'm a first time user of Pandora. I find it very user friendly. I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music."
27907,"Pandora",2013-11-16,3,"Great idea, not so great execution.   I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the ""bugs"" are annoying!"
27912,"Pandora",2013-10-31,4,"Pandora Review (free version)   Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.Pros:-free-offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in-there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations-easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button-they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes-if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons:-commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded-not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener-rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."

27919,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Pandora   Maybe I'm being too generous. I've had no experience with this app on other platforms, so I can't make comparisons.  I just know iWork's as advertised, much better clarity than normal radio, and less commercials. I think the options for creating your own stations are great, and I've been introduced to new music that fits my selected genre that I never would have found on my own."

27943,"Pandora",2016-05-08,3,"Pandora is ok but, Spotify has less ads   I use to love Pandora, I still use it but, THE ADS with a free account are getting ridiculous! Download Spotify, it's better."
27947,"Pandora",2013-01-09,5,"Expand your musical ear   What I love about Pandora is being exposed to artists and genres that heretofore I was not aware of, then being inspired to buy artists' recordings. No commercials, just good, solid music. Interested in Brazilian? Zydeco? Salsa? Top 40? Sinatra and the Rat Pack? Karmin and more? Even little-known artists are on here (Lee PressOn and the Nails for one). Give your ear a treat!"

27981,"Pandora",2013-11-21,5,"radio is not dead :)   I have loved Pandora for years, and I was so excited that I could have it on my tablet.

I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly.  I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides.  Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data  that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data.  There are a ton of visual advertisements!!!  But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them.  I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."

It nags if you just listen and do not give thumbs up or down on every song, I like it for listening to a lot of songs from a single artist, and the suggestions for similar artists are handy."
28314,"Pandora",2014-02-05,4,"LOVE THIS   Love that I can pick the type of music that I love.  I was disappointed though because when I put in my favorite Ricky Nelson in, it really just gave me that kind of music, but not necessarily Ricky Nelson.  I would have loved a bunch of his music.  Otherwise, I really like Pandora."
28316,"Pandora",2013-03-04,5,"Great!   I love pandora radio. first I love that its easy to use. Second the music is great you can put a artist or genre & it plays the songs .. what I also love is that you can search music from a certain time for example the 70's and it plays music exactly from that time only. I have found so many songs I have been looking for using pandora! Love it!"

28353,"Pandora",2015-10-25,3,"A decent way to get individualized music...   Pandora offers a way to individualize songs you enjoy listening to while on the computer, phone, or tablet. It's easy to set up and use but I think Amazon Prime offers a better product; one reason being that they offer entire albums as well as individual songs to Prime members. You can't beat Amazon Prime!"

It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app ."

Time goes by so much quicker when you have music you enjoy listening to.  I get to decide if today will be pop, soft rock or country, or just music similar to some of my favorites.  I really enjoy picking the all 80's or all 90's stations and easing through my day with great music.  Pandora is SUPER and I am glad it is out there for me to enjoy.  And I am just now learning how extensive this media is and I look forward to hearing it ALL!"

28432,"Pandora",2013-12-21,5,"Never thought it would be this good!   I've been an occasional listener to Pandora. I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is, $36 a year! I signed up, noticed the advertising gone, but more, since I had put some cash on the line, I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station. How do you go so seamlessly from Dixie Chicks, through Norah Jones and Steve Winwood, to Journey, with perfect song selection from each?! Really invigorating! I'm hooked!! Thank you Pandora! What a concept so well fulfilled!"

Five stars easy, the music and other programs offered on Pandora are what I enjoy listening too. Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing. Pandora  is good listening and I really don't mind the comms that are a part of the free programing either.Bill"

However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE."

28764,"Pandora",2013-01-07,4,"Nice sounds   I like having this download because thereare so any option of simularmusic to listen to.  The only thing I dont really like which Im on is pnly listening to one artist at a time instead of skipping from Artist to Artist.  This is why I download and pay for specific songs and not use this until Im tired of listenting to th same songs."

We are using it to build a Christian Christmas station, and while it occasionally throws in an unusual offering, most tracks are right on target.  Our family is having fun with it, and the commercials aren't too frequent or annoying."
28892,"Pandora",2016-08-21,5,"Don't get   It is good but it's like radio stations almost Spotify is better"

28925,"Pandora",2015-04-14,4,"Great music; Annoying ads   Great music, but annoying ads unless you want to pay $4.99/month. Also, no directions, so can't figure out how to turn it off on my tablet without turning it off completely."
28932,"Pandora",2013-09-01,5,"So Awesome   I love this app! Listen to your fave artist! It has pop, rock, rap, country, you name it! You can play games at the same time too. Play  anything while listening to your tunes. Dance and sing to any artist on the planet!"

Bluetooth in the car and works with your phone (does take a lot of data).  A couple bucks per month takes away the commercials."
28937,"Pandora",2016-09-22,5,"Five Stars   Favorite way to stream music. Works on multiple devices"

28978,"Pandora",2016-06-21,5,"Pandora Rocks   Love Pandora. Great music listed with a variety to fit everyone's interest."
28979,"Pandora",2016-05-17,4,"Music as you want it...   Think of it as a radio where you can tell the station what you want to listen to..."
28989,"Pandora",2017-08-16,5,"Five Stars   It's great for all."
28995,"Pandora",2016-12-25,5,"Five Stars   Love every minute every second!!!"
29005,"Pandora",2014-01-18,2,"After the love has gone....   When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling.  You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of.  You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact.  You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to.  You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening!  You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true?  Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on?  You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations.  So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together.  You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret.  Why? Why Pandora Why?"
29021,"Pandora",2014-03-27,3,"A little more annoying then useful   I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."
29022,"Pandora",2014-12-07,1,"I wouldn't give one star if I had the option   This app will start to play a station then it will have another music station overlapping the first. I tried updating. Did not work. I tried un installing. Not working again. This app needs work."
29023,"Pandora",2014-08-12,5,"Best free music available on the web   Best free music available on the web.  I have it now on my smart TV's and my Smart Phone and computer.  Who needs to pay Sirius XM over $100.00 per year to hear their choices when you can select your choices at Pandora."
29027,"Pandora",2017-01-23,5,"Five Stars   awesome product.. will buy again"
29030,"Pandora",2016-05-24,5,"Give Pandora a chance and you'll be hook!   I like a variety of music, and I can set  various playlists to enjoy the moment!"
29031,"Pandora",2014-07-17,5,"Pandora is a great app. I have it on my android Phone ...   Pandora is a great app. I have it on my android Phone (HTC Thunderbolt), my laptop and my android tablet. I only have the free app for now but the makers deserve something for this fine app and so I plan on getting the Plus."
29032,"Pandora",2016-12-10,5,"Five Stars   Love thump print plays what I pick"
29035,"Pandora",2016-07-07,1,"Fix this   Pandora stoped working for me today and I tried redownloading and it still wont work"

29044,"Pandora",2014-05-05,5,"The best   I would give this app a 4.9 I want to listen to music but it's like a radio you love the band but you really don't know the band that isplaying or you favorite kind of music for example country but you don't  like the singer but great app"

29064,"Pandora",2016-01-23,5,"Pandora is great and user friendly   We all love this one.  Works just like it does on an iPhone.  Used for a new Kindle we got for the family."
29066,"Pandora",2015-11-22,5,"Fantastic!   Thank goodness apps like these exist. Sometimes I get bored of the radio, or my own music. This fills the gap perfectly!"
29068,"Pandora",2013-01-11,5,"I love Pandora   I absolutely love Pandora.  I love music and Pandora allows me to listen to all my favorite artists without having to change CDs.  I use Pandora when working in the kitchen and use it at night when I am restless and unable to sleep.  I love being able to type in an artist and there he/she is for me to listen to.  Amazing!!"
29069,"Pandora",2013-07-06,5,"No words but one wow   This is terrific! I updated to Pandora one it's soo good!

You should buy this app it's terrific!"
29070,"Pandora",2016-06-09,5,"Five Stars   I have used Pandora for years and have no issues using it on our kindle. :)"
29080,"Pandora",2017-08-07,4,"Four Stars   Easy to use and BIG selection."

29085,"Pandora",2015-08-08,1,"worked great until the latest update on 8   worked great until the latest update on 8.7.now it just cycles through the play lists and tells you it can't find any songs?? Greedy bastards!!"
29095,"Pandora",2013-06-12,5,"AWESOME   Two Words: Get It.But since I can't submit this with two words, I'll rave about the awesome so that Pandora is. It has millions of stations to choose from, barely frequent ads, skips, and a thumbs up/down system that helps to get the music that you love. And it's free! How good does it get?"
29098,"Pandora",2013-12-26,5,"It's better with subscription   It is so much better just buying the subscription so no commercials are played and the sound quality is awesome. I play it just about anywhere I can. i did love the sleep setting but the last update has removed it (Or I just can't find it on the new home page)."
29105,"Pandora",2013-12-08,4,"Good as far as it goes   Good selections tied to one's choice of artist, although one would like more controlafter a first extended listen.  A thumbs up for a song tends to spread the choices even more, asit increases the branching ""links"" rather than narrow the range."
29106,"Pandora",2016-11-16,5,"Easy radio   In my opinion Pandora is the best radio place to have. I use it more than my actual phone music."
29107,"Pandora",2017-08-17,5,"Five Stars   Best thing ever"

29400,"Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"Best Music App EVER!!!   We love Pandora in our house! We always have this app playing on one of our devices. I love this app because it saves your stations so when  you come back to it you can continue listening to your station, or change it to a station you've saved before, or easily create a new station! This app is great for the whole family! My kids (12, 10, 4 & 2) all love music and use this app frequently. It's easy to use and easy to change stations so even my 2 year old knows how to turn on his favorite Disney music. There are unlimited stations to search for so anything the kids want to hear they can find very easily. We even have different profiles set on each device so we can monitor what the kids can or cannot listen to, I love the parental controls so I don't have to worry about my  kids listening to bad music. We love everything about Pandora and will always use this app!!!"

29600,"Pandora",2014-04-07,1,"Serious problem with Kindle Fire HDX after installing Pandora   I don't install that many apps on my Kindle.  (I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything.  I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer.  I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened.  I assumed the battery was drained.  I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else.  I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes.  Then I tried opening it.  Nothing.  I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime.  I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared.  The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle.  Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared.  I entered my PIN, nothing.  Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked.  I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora.  I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal.  I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network.  I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."
29606,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"Five Stars   I love the line up after selecting your song of choice"
29611,"Pandora",2016-05-10,5,"Five Stars   Um who doesn't love continuous music with the ability to add variety?"
29613,"Pandora",2016-05-27,5,"Five Stars   I enjoy Pandora it is nice to be able to have so many selections."
29615,"Pandora",2016-07-27,4,"Four Stars   I wish I could select my songs in an easier manner."
29617,"Pandora",2014-11-25,5,"ABSOLUTLY A MUST GET!   I HAVE THIS ON MOST ALL DAY....THEY GET TO KNOW YOU AND THE KIND OF MUSIC IS JUST FANTASTIC.! I LISTEN ON MY ZEKI TABLET WITH SPEAKER BOOST AND IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM IN ORCHESTRA HALL!"
29619,"Pandora",2013-12-18,5,"Customized music   The more you use it, the better it tailors the music to your taste.  Wife has it on whenever the Kindle is in the room for recharging.Free service has ads, but they're less annoying than the radio.  Great product, and you can't beat the price!"
29624,"Pandora",2016-10-25,5,"Good AP for background music.   Good APP but is it just me or have the ads gotten more frequent compared to a few years back?"
29627,"Pandora",2016-12-13,3,"Three Stars   Cuts out frequently"

29662,"Pandora",2013-03-20,5,"Music Music Music   What isn't to love about Pandora!  You get to make up your own radio stations, and if you go with the free version, the commercials are very short.  I really like how it give you suggestions of artists that have similiar music so you can learn about other groups and broaden your music listening."
29663,"Pandora",2015-02-23,5,"Music for Happy Memories   Pandora is great!!  I first started hearing music from Pandora at my friend's house.  I'm going to school online (while living in transitional housing), so I listen to Pandora as I work.  The music is from years gone by (and from movies I've watched [i.e. Dirty Dancing to name one of them]).  The other day I was listening to my music and heard a song that I used to love, but haven't heard for years.  It is music that makes you want to dance or just move to the music."
29664,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"Great way to listen to whatever you want   Pandora is a fabulous way to listen to whatever type of music suits your mood for the moment.  Much variety. 4 stars because it will ask often enough if you are still listening and you need to answer it or the music stops playing- that gets old."

29711,"Pandora",2015-02-23,4,"Pandora Lives On...   Pandora searches not only for that particular artist/ music you seek, finding this and similar.  Often the reward is music new to you and or some you've forgotten."
29712,"Pandora",2015-02-11,5,"Amazing!   I love it! The only way it could be better is if it didn't need wick! I listen to music almost 24/7 so that would help. But other than that AWESOME!!!!!! ★♪♥"
29713,"Pandora",2013-12-28,5,"Hard to beat   It's hard to beat getting to choose your own style of music with the ability to ""dislike"" a song to never have it play again.  I have several ""stations"" set up to match the mood I am in whenever I want music on in the background."
29715,"Pandora",2016-11-22,5,"Five Stars   Great station choices."
29716,"Pandora",2015-07-26,5,"I love the varieties of music   I love he many varieties you can listen to with great quality and the name of the artist and the label cover are all a plus for me."

29752,"Pandora",2017-01-10,4,"stream away, but on your Wifi!   I  Love Pandora. I love listening to it when I am cooking in the kitchen. I like having it on to turn on random songs why I am running or walking. The only thing I don't like about it is it's streaming and using up your data on your phone. And it uses a lot of data.  But the stations you can make up and you can add other artist to the stations you can make up is pretty awesome. I have the Neighbourhood radio station. Do you that I added Calvin Harris. So I can have dramatic songs and happy dance songs all at once. It's kind of like having the best of both worlds."
29760,"Pandora",2015-03-06,4,"Great Music!   I love Pandora because you get free music, and who doesn't like free music?? I know I do. You get to decide what you listen to and base a radio off of your favorite song or band."
29761,"Pandora",2016-10-23,4,"Four Stars   Love having my music playing"
29763,"Pandora",2013-07-25,4,"Pandora   I like pandora a lot. I am dissatisfied with the 40 hour time limit a month. Also I would like more skips an hour. Pandora is good about volume. Thank you, Pandora for getting me through my workday one week a month. I only wish we could spend more time together. For free."
29764,"Pandora",2014-01-12,5,"Superior digital music feed   I have the free subscription,and I love it. I have enjoyed Sirius FM in my Ford Escape,but cancelled it because of cost.  I am 80 years old, retired 21 years,and watching my expenses.Sirius offered a half-price deal for six months, which I accepted. When that expired, I cancelled again.When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted.  Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

29786,"Pandora",2013-03-02,5,"Great!   Pandora is a wonderful music service with 40 hours of free listening a month.  I first found it on my Blu-ray player and have since added it to my desktop, I-pod and now, Kindle. You pick your favorite songs, artists or composers and Pandora plays music in and around those choices.  Pretty wild!"

29823,"Pandora",2013-05-02,4,"My favorite invention   I listen to Pandora allllll the time, in my car, through my TV and while I'm getting ready, I love it.  However I wish there was a way to view albums you've already listened to after you close out and there isn't a way to listen to the song again if you liked it.  It's almost perfect."

29878,"Pandora",2013-06-25,5,"Repetitive Commercials   I realize that somebody has to pay the bills, however, I wish that Pandora would acquire more sponsors, in order to incorporate a variety of commercials, rather than the same ones over, and over again.  Otherwise, I love them!"
29879,"Pandora",2015-03-27,4,"Pandora on TV is a treat!   I love to listen to Pandora on my smart TV and other portable devices.  The random play is very nice, but I wish you could replay a selection on command."

30164,"Pandora",2014-04-25,1,"Pandora One upgrade? More like Pandora NONE!   Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. (never received an error message before upgrading)it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer.  I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all.Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

30217,"Pandora",2013-03-10,3,"not as good as they use to be.   I love the fact that I can listen to just about any type of music I want. I like old rock music, but when I'm at work I can't listen to rock because I work with seniors so I put in big band or musicals and the seniors love it. The only problem is that they play to many commercials now."
30218,"Pandora",2016-10-06,1,"One Star   Did not buy this product"
30223,"Pandora",2016-02-04,4,"Good, but limited to the west   Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
30228,"Pandora",2016-09-26,4,"Four Stars   Really enjoyed the variety"
30229,"Pandora",2016-10-22,4,"Its cool ,only critique is it locks up alot ,and while I understand the need for comercials,why the same car adds?   Ok but locks up alot"

30256,"Pandora",2017-01-08,5,"Five Stars   Great!"
30257,"Pandora",2013-07-02,5,"Love Pandora   Pandora has introduced me to so many new artists that I love. I don't have anything bad to say about it. (One thing I do wish is that you could listen to a song again, or somehow store it on your device - but I understand why this can't be done.) It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the $36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps."

30271,"Pandora",2014-03-22,4,"Love Pandora.   The app is easy to use and has a good layout.  The only thing I didn't like was how close together the rating and skip buttons are to each other.  It was too easy to tap the wrong button.  Everything else worked great."

Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it's not broke don't fix it. Sometimes I can't connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing."

30390,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"LOVE!   Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"

Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy.  I was hooked instantly.  When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."

The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle."

30456,"Pandora",2013-09-21,4,"Easy to use.   I was surprised at how easy it is to use; though I dislike these reviews due to need for too many words. I will continue to explore the benefits and offerings.  I was slightly disappointed that a few of my favorite artists/songs were not available."

I am still new at it, but I am still enjoying it very much! I like the option of skipping a song you do not like. I am still trying to figure this thing out! From what I understand for $.99 a day, you can do more ""skips."" For $.99 it is worth checking out!"

30767,"Pandora",2013-01-15,5,"Music radio   Pandora is a product that allows you to control what is played. It is good to have this after work to unwind. One word of caution, if you listen on the computer or your Kindle using a Hotspot, Pandora will use a lot of data. Don't be surprised if you have a larger bill than usual."

You can pick your artists that you like and then it will recommend music from what you've liked.  You can make your own ""radio stations"" and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs.  It also puts them into categories, which I like (country, alternative, etc.)  For example, in his country, he has the ""Lee Brice"" station, his rap the ""Eminem"" station, etc.  And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc."
30966,"Pandora",2014-02-20,2,"sorry   I really like Pandora, but not sure if its Pandora or my Kindle, but the song will start to play then stop and then start again.  There is a pause in the middle of the song, it reminds me of my CD's skipping."

Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."

I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the ""no commercials"" aspect, which I have.  Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM""  what the ????I mean really?  They pay?  No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me.  But again the music is good and I do like the app."

I love Christmas music and it is the best way for me to hear a variety of Christmas songs--even year round.  I love the selection and how my choices are considered as Pandora customizes it for me.  I'm so glad I have this now!"
31730,"Pandora",2016-08-11,5,"Five Stars   awsome"
31735,"Pandora",2015-07-17,5,"Great music app!   What can I say, who doesn't love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down"" which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you don't feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song.It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it.I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing.I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want.I am very happy with this app!"
31745,"Pandora",2016-06-10,5,"Five Stars   Enjoy the selection."
31753,"Pandora",2016-06-27,5,"Five Stars   just another app"

31799,"Pandora",2014-02-21,1,"I don't like it !   Pandora doesn't really play what I like , the stations don't play enough music for me so that's why I rate it a 1 ..."
31806,"Pandora",2013-01-12,5,"Pandora   Installed it on my Kindle Fire HD and it's a great companion if you want some soft music while reading.  Much better and easier than carrying a radio around.  Can also be installed on your iPhone.  Which is better that using up all your iPhone storage space."

31850,"Pandora",2014-03-25,5,"Glad I got it   I've been hearing about Pandora, but thought it was one of those satillite radio things that were super expensive and kind of a waste of time, especially in an age of downloading music. Well I recently have become addicted to various styles of Gregorian Chant music to help me relax & meditate and found Pandora to have the best selctions. Plus, it being a free app to download I thought ""why not?"". Love this app; definately recommend for anyone looking for that hard to find sound in a sea of contemporary music."

Like I said if I had reviewed this before it would have faced spout the way it was able to choose songs I like just by a few likes and the  station you are on... but after the new update well... yes it still does all that yummy deliciousness but it now takes nearly a half an hour to open and consistently turns off when I have the screen closed of other apps running which are things that it used to do no problem I even took it off the stupid power save mode and it still does this. So Pandora people I want the old app back PLEASE!!!!"

32343,"Pandora",2015-04-20,4,"Pandora is a fine way to listen to what you like in music.   I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows  what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"
32345,"Pandora",2016-06-22,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
32347,"Pandora",2016-05-31,5,"Five Stars   It is great."

32349,"Pandora",2014-11-18,5,"AWESOME   I listen to pandora 24-7 just about. I only watch tv approx. 3 hrs a week the rest is relaxing music, piano man etc while I read."
32350,"Pandora",2013-01-02,5,"This is the best music service that I have tried.   This music service allows me to listen to several songs from an artist that I might have heard on the radio or TV, and really find out if I want to hear more.  It is easy to use, and setting up a new station takes a few seconds.  Couldn't be easier."
32351,"Pandora",2013-01-02,5,"Love it   I love Pandora.  I only use the free app., and still its awesome!  The commercials are rare, and I don't mind them anyway.  Commercials allow the program to exist - just like television.  This is a GREAT way to get all the music you could ever use!!"
32354,"Pandora",2013-07-18,3,"Pandora   This program used to be the way to listen to your music and ""chill-lax"" but now it has, at least this is how I feel, I am elderly, but it has gotten to hard to use. Wish it were still simple, hated to leave it."
32357,"Pandora",2013-08-22,1,"Will not open on my kindle   This app works on my android but not on my kindle anymore. Just says ""Pandora one"" nothing else. I would change my review if this is fixed"

32367,"Pandora",2016-03-30,3,"love this station!!!   lose the station at times"
32368,"Pandora",2014-01-29,5,"Good   This works just the same as the desktop version but if I had to give it a negative mark, it would be that it seems to go to commercial a lot sooner than it does on the desktop version."
32371,"Pandora",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars   All good"
32372,"Pandora",2016-06-11,5,"Five Stars   Great app"

32400,"Pandora",2014-02-12,5,"better than thought   Pandora is much better than i thought it would be when compared to I Heart Radio.the music that they  play is spot on to my intrest . I give them an A+.John Asbell"
32403,"Pandora",2013-10-21,5,"WONDERFUL!!!   Nothing better than to have a program that learns what you enjoy!I often put it on during house parties...no need to even touch it again!!Unless of course someone has a request!"
32405,"Pandora",2013-12-24,1,"terrible, no good,   I couldn't even listen to music. At first it was not available, then my session was over. Don't buy this app. it is  trash"
32408,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"from a music lover   Being a true lover of music and all types of music, I love Pandora. It makes listening easy and enjoyable. I listen nonstop. Music on the go or at home. Keep these great ideas coming."
32409,"Pandora",2014-03-16,4,"Great fun to play with.   I think it is so much fun to see what happens when I choose my favorite songs.  But I wish I could skip every song I d like.  Instead I have to switch stations t change music."

32425,"Pandora",2016-10-24,4,"The concept is great. I do believe that Pandora knows that I ...   The concept is great. I do believe that Pandora knows that I am a Sirius user and play more commercials than my friends who do not subscribe to Sirius."
32436,"Pandora",2014-01-16,5,"Pandora Rocks!..... Or classics, or swings or....   You can listen to the style of music you prefer with any given mood!  Create stations and educate pandora as to what belongs and what doesn't to creat your perfect radio stations!  Love"
32443,"Pandora",2016-03-28,4,"Four Stars   Works great for a radio."
32447,"Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"I love Pandora   I can play songs according to my mood. For example, I have songs to fold clothes by, read a book by, paint a picture by.  I can learn more about the artists I like with the biograhpy info."
32448,"Pandora",2013-08-10,5,"Nice very nice   Even with the ads this is a gem.  I can select my artist and it will bring up songs by that artist and others from the same genre.  I can click on a dislike and never get that artist again.  Plays while using other apps."
32453,"Pandora",2016-06-09,5,"Five Stars   Love It!"
32461,"Pandora",2012-11-13,4,"Like it   Not bad for a radio app. Plays music I haven't heard in years. it's not Spotify but since I can't get it on my tablet Pandora will do. The one thing I dislike is I can only skip 6 time in any given hour so I just change thru my song list to switch songs."
32469,"Pandora",2015-10-01,5,"Great App!   A great music application that works well on my Kindle Fire HD7"
32471,"Pandora",2016-07-08,5,"Five Stars   It's wonderful"

32476,"Pandora",2014-01-05,5,"So nice to have it at the tip of my fingers.   There is nothing negative to be said about Pandora.  App just sits right there waiting for you.  It was a pre- installed app on my Smart TV and is now a downloaded on android and laptop."

32709,"Pandora",2013-03-14,4,"Open Sesame! Make me an old time DJ   Pandora works nicely on my new Kindle Fire. So why the 4 stars vs. a 5? Because, I am not sure it really deserves more than 4! In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain. If it costs you nothing to try Pandora, I recommend that you get it and make your own assessment."

32780,"Pandora",2016-05-22,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
32785,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"Typical of most Amazon Apps   I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music.  I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it.  The Kindle, that is.  However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right.  Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers:  the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid.  Pandora is advertised as free:  download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE.  Not so, of course:  if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements.  If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever.  Ads pop up all over the place.  You can't see the album covers for ads.  Oh, but wait:  just pay the price, and the ads will go away!  The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad.  What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay.  I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle.  The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words.  The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time.  As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."

32965,"Pandora",2014-01-02,5,"Pandora Radio   I enjoy Pandora because it offered the experience I wanted in a simple manner. I wanted to listen to the things I like in a radio fashion without having to select each song individually. Pandora offers that, just type in the desired artists and songs and listen to just them or click shuffle and get a bit of the whole group plus some recommended related groups. The component of liking or disliking the song that is playing is another fantastic feature that ensure only the enjoyable stuff gets repeated."

33778,"Pandora",2013-06-15,5,"Amazing!   Pandora is a spectacular musical app! There are many channels you can possibly have! Some songs take my parents to the hip hop days! They also have lyrics for you to sing along. Get this awesome app"
33783,"Pandora",2013-06-02,3,"Good variety   I enjoy listening to various genres and was pleased to have the ability to go from hip hop, rap then spa music.Could do without the commercials, but that's probably how they deliver great music."

33828,"Pandora",2015-03-23,5,"Five Stars   Love it. Only minor issue is the number of commercials but they are over quickly."
33830,"Pandora",2016-03-24,3,"Use Spotify, it's better anyway   The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole.  There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to.  If you don't Pandora just stops, doesn't play any more music, but stays open.  There isn't any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app.  You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu.  There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song.  The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."

It has been to cold with ice and snow   I haven't been able to use the pole saw yet due to weather so it's hard to impossible to give a fare rating. The only thing I have a small problem with, setting aside the fact I haven't started it yet, is the lack of a chain guard for storage. I really won't be using the line trimmer system because I already have a large cutter and would rather dough the adaptation would hold up under my usage. I wish I could have purchased the saw without the line trimmer portion."

35205,"Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"not defective after all   I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nook app.  However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time.  What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it.  That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened.  Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be ""intuitive"" to many isn't ""intuitive"" to me.  Anyway, I'm thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would have rated it with 5 stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."

I love Pandora, and have been using it for many years - this is the first year I've had a tablet and was very exciting to discover Pandora. Artists, Songs, Genres are easy to find and use - especially for those of us who are technically-challenged. My little complaint is that I can't always ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" a song...what is equally nice and sometimes frustrating, is this app allows you to listen to music while doing other things on your tablet. Minor quirks aside - I'm very happy with this app and would recommend to anyone!"

36558,"Pandora",2013-12-15,5,"So good I listen for hours   I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life.  That sounds melodramatic but it's true.  I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds.  I'm living on a shoestring.  And I live way out in the sticks.  There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here.  On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music.  The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano.  I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied.  Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me.  That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate.  I took the upgrade right away - it's an inexpensive way to get rid of ads."
36559,"Pandora",2014-08-14,5,"Five Stars   I enjoy listening to Pandora wherever I am withought bulky boom box or other devices."

36586,"Pandora",2013-03-04,5,"Love It   This is a great way to listen to music without purchasing a lot of CDs.  The frequency of the ads are not too bad, much fewer than live radiio.  I highly recommend purchase."

Type in the artist name and hear their music plus others like them. I'm a fan of TuneIn and I find Pandora a nice alternative. If you enjoy a variety of music then download this app. The down side-it cuts off after a while if you're not a paid subscriber. Not a deal breaker but me personally, I have a problem paying for radio. Lol...maaybe I'mjust getting old but hey, I remember when the radio use to be free."

I'm tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? Won't renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they're focused on a young audience."

38134,"Pandora",2015-08-17,4,"Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart ...   My only real complaint about Pandora is that you cannot press thumbs down an unlimited amount of times. It keeps giving me R&B type songs for some reason, and it won't let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."
38135,"Pandora",2013-07-09,5,"simply great   I have a couple of similar apps but this one is my favorite.  It is simple to use and love that you can thumbs up or thumbs down songs."

39135,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"No Regrets Downloading   I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."

40006,"Pandora",2016-04-30,3,"Very quirky!   I love it when it is working! More often than not, it will not work when I am connected to Wi-Fi at my gym. IHeart Radio works fine so it's not my phone or the gym's Wi-Fi. Recently, Pandora stopped working altogether on my phone, whether I was connected to my home Wi-Fi, the gym's, or no Wi-Fi at all (making me use data). I would turn on the app, and my phone screen would go black. Had to turn the phone off and back on again to get my home screen. So I uninstalled Pandora, and then reinstalled it. Now it is working; let's see for how long."

If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."

I open it while at the computer, turn the music down low and am comforted while doing whatever on the computer.  Learned the ""hard way"" Pandora uses cell phone data.  Some kind soul advised me to connect to my in home wifi and I would not incur data overage.  One is able to set up their favorite music, Gospel, 60s, 70s, etc. and choose according to their mood which to listen to.  I am probably preaching to the choir.  A nice feature is Pandora is a free app.I am told it can be connected to one's computer.  Haven't tried this yet."

41101,"Pandora",2013-01-31,3,"Pandora   I like the idea that Pandora will try to find music that you like but...so far I don't think it's very good at it."
41103,"Pandora",2012-11-26,4,"better than radio   The only thing that would make it better would be to actually pick songs you want to hear.  It does repeat songs sometimes."
41106,"Pandora",2014-10-29,4,"Four Stars   Good app!"
41108,"Pandora",2013-04-25,5,"Great Pandora   Pandora has the type of music I like to listen to.  I love the different type of genre Pandora offers."
41109,"Pandora",2016-07-26,4,"I like Pandora better than others   I like Pandora better than others, I had premium service. Unfortunately I got annoyed by the inability to skip as many songs I want when I want it. So I  had canceled the service."
41112,"Pandora",2013-03-21,5,"Party   I just put on Pandora and let the music go without a DJ to talk. I also like sharing stations with friends."
41114,"Pandora",2014-05-18,2,"it's always running   I like Pandora.  When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc.  When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire.  This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days.  The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated.  I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used!  Some apps never stop running.  This seems to be one of them.  I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that.  If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem.  But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."
41119,"Pandora",2013-01-14,5,"Love the variety   So much to choose from and will never get tired of the same music over and over. I would recommend this to everyone."

Make sure to turn your receiving device off if you are not listening because Pandora gets charged even though you are not hearing the music.

I subscribe to Pandora radio...but I subscribed through GooglePlay 6 months ago.I downloaded the app onto my new Kindle..logged in...and no music.It shows the album art and everything like normal....but not a sound. Maybe because I originally got it through Google??  This is not cool.I'm starting to see this Kindle as a waste of $$ and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon. My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it won't play on this thing."

41606,"Pandora",2014-04-04,1,"Beware of commercials   The free version has a ridiculous amount of commercials. Initially it wasn't too bad, but the more Pandora was played, the more commercials were played. Also, many of the the pop up ads have an adult theme to them, so beware of the commercial/ad content. I'm sure their idea is to breakdown the user by having so many commercials that they'll download the app with the monthly fee. Boo! :("

41854,"Pandora",2016-01-20,5,"AWESOME !!!   I like it very much...I get to chose the songs I will be listening to. I also like the fact that if I don't like a particular song or if I am tired of listening to certain songs, I can give them a thumbs done and I won't hear them again... I have had Pandora on my computer for awhile and I love it. However, when I am away from my computer, I didn't have it because I had an older phone. So, I upgraded my phone to a smart phone and now I get to listen to Pandora whenever I want !!! Yipee !!!"

41926,"Pandora",2016-01-21,5,"I Love Pandora   I love this and use it everyday. I thinks it's better than any other music app. There are so many ready made stations, that all you have to do it chose a band or style that you like and it will play it for you. But it gets even better because you can  personalize it to your individual taste"
41929,"Pandora",2012-06-01,5,"awesome   i love it. best app ever. would recmend to all music fans. has choices for evrryone. if u love music u will love this aop."

41948,"Pandora",2015-12-01,1,"Not working   Pandora works great on everything except my new amazon fire tablets. I bought 2 tablets and neither have sound when running Pandora. It's the only program that does not work. Amazon fire only. Program runs, shows a song is playing, progression bar does not move, no sound on tablet. 1 star only for fire tablet. 5 stars on any other device."
41954,"Pandora",2015-08-25,4,"not very adept at it but easy to set up   needed a source of background music in my living room....not very adept at it but easy to set up. Will stop and ask if I'm still listening and occasionally run an advertisement and seems to make assumptions about the type of music I want, but seldom runs anything I don't like."

41968,"Pandora",2013-01-10,4,"like it   I like it and it works well for the mindless it was being played on a laptop or smart phone"
41971,"Pandora",2012-11-29,5,"Great   I play it while working on my computer and just to relax. Its great that I can control the music"

41989,"Pandora",2013-01-07,5,"pandora   I have always loved pandora and I use this app on all my products that I own in my house"
41991,"Pandora",2012-11-25,5,"Pandora is great.   It is the best way to get all the music I like. I play it all the time. It very easy to use."
41992,"Pandora",2012-12-09,4,"Awesome   I listen to all the time and its like having your very own DJ.  I am very pleased with it!"
41993,"Pandora",2015-08-06,5,"Pandora ROCKS!   Have been listening to Pandora for years. I love that I can plug in a 'vibe' I want and get all kinds of music I've never heard of. Have used it for Halloween parties, holiday get-togethers, and my go-to station for work is one of my favorite motion picture score composers. I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I don't mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials. Love that I can listen to Pandora on my Kindle while reading, I can access it on my iPad while working out, and I can bluetooth-stream it through my car. I'm always just a click away from my favorite music!"
41994,"Pandora",2015-03-18,3,"Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and ...   Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and upon falling asleep, I was startled by an Advertisement announcement.  Well it took another hour to fall back asleep.  I found that to be Add Free, Pandora will accept a MONTHLY FEE of $4.55 not a small one time FEE.  So no more sleep sounds.But Pandora is nice and ok, but I rather use my Kindle Fire and IPhone for my Music Videos.  Oh forgot to say, you have commercial adds even when your Pandora music files, just walk away and you will not see any ads."
41999,"Pandora",2013-02-02,5,"great app   this app is great and so is the quility of it . there is a lot of stuff advable ."
42001,"Pandora",2012-12-16,5,"great sounds   I like the feeling that I know I have music at my finger tips when and where I want it."
42002,"Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"It's ok   When i listen to it, it is ok. Don't use it often. This site is new to me and it is ok"
42006,"Pandora",2011-11-19,5,"love Pandora   Pandora is the perfect radio station.  Having it on your phone is even better.  And the price was perfect!  Get it for your Android."
42014,"Pandora",2016-08-04,3,"Plays some music that does not match the station name.   At first I loved this  and still love parts of it.The issue that I have with it is that when I listen to a Station that I have.They are supposed to play music similar the the title of the  station I am listening to.... it tends to play music that has nothing to do with the station that I am listening to.For example. I have one called ""Loretta Lynn Radio"" She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline,Kitty Wells,etc....SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music. ??  That is one of the songs that they played on the Loretta Lynn Station."
42015,"Pandora",2012-09-06,5,"must have   A must  have for anyone that loves music, or for any one who likes to  make  the time past better."
42029,"Pandora",2017-02-02,1,"annoying   it keeps coming on when I'm doing something else on another menu. I can't get rid of it unless I completely close down my device."
42032,"Pandora",2013-01-25,3,"Not the best version   It plays well but I feel limited in how it plays. The screen is clear but not easy to use."
42042,"Pandora",2012-03-17,3,"review   its ok but needs better options for phone. your music genre is next to none. volume control would be awesome."
42043,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"yes I am so new at this...I love being able to find my favorites.   I would recommend  this to anyone that I know that has Kindle.  I was surprised at the quality of music on my Kindle."
42045,"Pandora",2016-09-28,5,"Five Stars   I like the fact I'm able to pick the songs i like"
42046,"Pandora",2015-06-26,5,"My favorite app!  I use this every day!   I absolutely love Pandora!  I choose to add the monthly subscription (it's like $3.99 a month) and the subscription is totally worth it.  Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can't skip but with the subscription there are no ads.  I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time.  I have even found new artists and songs I didn't know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix."
42049,"Pandora",2014-05-24,1,"auto closes before i can start uses   Another ap that won't open just goes back to home screen of the kindle. Very annoying.  (But hey that's what my droid and iPod are for.....right?)"
42051,"Pandora",2016-05-16,4,"what was the point???   I love the app but one problem: the comment section.  People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand  post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information.  And I keep saying, "" do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen."". And people are just being inappropriate.  So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."
42057,"Pandora",2013-12-30,5,"Music I like at my fingertips   My neighbor helped me sign-up on Pandora.  We were able to listen to great, instrumental Christmas music.  Now I can listen to many different varieties of music that my wife and I enjoy.  Mostly easy-listening.  I have a wireless speaker that I can take to any room I want and the music is right there.  What a treat.  No more crap radio."
42062,"Pandora",2016-04-06,1,"Tired of it taking over my camera....   This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone."
42063,"Pandora",2017-07-06,2,"Disappointing   I am 10 and I have no idea what a zip code is! I can't sign in! I thought you just get to hear music, but no! I uninstalled because I don't want to go though all this stuff... Darn it :("
42064,"Pandora",2016-10-04,4,"Good music app   Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are looking for a good music app this is it."
42073,"Pandora",2012-03-05,4,"Pandora Great   Great i love it you can mix your music to the way you like it and its all free.Did i say free."
42075,"Pandora",2017-03-24,5,"MyPandora   I rated this app 5 stars because of how im able to personalize my stations and how wide the variety of music is I LOVE PANDORA!!!!"
42078,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"Could always be better   I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."
42082,"Pandora",2016-06-30,5,"GET THIS APP!!!!!!! :)   GET THIS GAME U CAN LISTEN TO ALL YOUR SONGS AND U CAN SEARCH THEM TOOPLUS U CAN PUT THUMPS UP OR DOWN BUT I LOVE THIS APP IF I WERE U I WOULD GET THIS APP!! :)P.S.

42090,"Pandora",2016-11-13,5,"hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you ...   This site enables you to pick that one singer that you want to hear more of and create your station, voila, there you are, hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you want, I have 7!!"
42092,"Pandora",2016-06-10,4,"Would get 5 stars if the buffering wasn't so long!   I like this app but the buffering is driving me crazy!I have a Kindle Fire and the app buffers like crazy at the beginning when you start to use it.Once it starts and you get the station or music you like its ok at that time."
42099,"Pandora",2014-02-14,5,"Best music streaming app.   I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available.  They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres.  Great job Pandora."
42103,"Pandora",2016-11-04,5,"Five Stars   I love listening to my gospel music on this station"
42106,"Pandora",2015-02-23,1,"Spotify it better!   Now Listen,Spotify is better because you can pick what songs you want to here! on pandora ypu have to wait until you find a song you like,Trust me spotify is better because when you get the game you can get a 7 day trial that lets you listen to your songs where ever you want (Without WiFi) and it gives you better quality and NO ADS (Even know there is not a lot of ads and it only has ads about GOOD songs) and Pandora gives you an ad after every song! And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music (Maybe) and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i don't recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!"
42109,"Pandora",2017-05-20,1,"One Star   sucks"
42110,"Pandora",2014-04-08,5,"Awesome App!   Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great  was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
42115,"Pandora",2016-01-25,4,"Pandora fits the bill   Love Pandora radio - good variety of stations to choose from or make up your own.  Pick a band you like and Pandora will create a station with your band of choice along with other singers or groups that fall into the same genre.  Overall its a quality listening experience that you can take anywhere."
42120,"Pandora",2014-04-22,4,"Love it!   I'm still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. It's nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"

42132,"Pandora",2017-02-09,2,"I used to love Pandora.   I used to love Pandora.... however, recently the variety is limited and with the free version the ads were unbearable and way too frequent. Uninstalled, I now use the YouTube music app. No ads, and free with as much variation as I want."

42139,"Pandora",2013-02-05,1,"Please do not get.   One time I was listening to it (once it logged me properly) and I exited out. For some strange reason Selena Gomez was still singing. I logged into Twitter, still singing. It went to the next song (Jessie J, I believe). I shut it off and Jessie J continued to sing. I had to hold the power button down for 20 seconds, let go, and hold it down for 3 more seconds (that is how I re-boot my Kindle). I deleted the app the second my Kindle powered back up. I told all my friends and family about it, and now I'm telling you. Please fix this."
42142,"Pandora",2015-07-28,5,"Internet Radio at its finest.   Its the evolution of broadcast radio, but better.  I knew Pandora was available online, but I was delighted to find an app for it that works with my KindleFire. The sound is incredible. This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-book or surfing the web.  I program only the types of music that I want to hear and it provides the lyrics to most songs, allowing you to become familiar with the artists, the titles and the albums of the songs you are hearing for future purchase, if you so choose."

Pandora is alright at most, they always say they get the perfect song at the perfect moment and that is just dead wrong. You'll randomly listen to a radio station lets say country radio. At some point in your session you'll end up hearing rap or some completely different artist than the one you specifically went to a radio for"
42148,"Pandora",2013-02-22,5,"the varity offered is just geat   I had siriusxm, which was fine,but it offered one at a time,Elvis,Frank Sinatra,Dean martin,or Country.with Pandora I get all four with out changing stations."
42150,"Pandora",2013-02-23,5,"Pandora App   OMG!  I got rid of my smart phone due to the cost.  My boyfriend and I were talking about music. He said how much he loves Pandora. I used to have it with my phone. I bought a Kindle Fire a few months ago. He informed me that I could get the app on my Kindle. I was THRILLED!  Oh Pandora how I have missed thee!"
42151,"Pandora",2017-03-24,5,"Beyond a radio stand in; still the best music discovery tool   I love Pandora and have been following it since the beginning. I told my dad that it would be everywhere one day and, I'll be darned if it isn't standard in a lot of cars and TVs now. It still beats all the new services, like Spotify, since I think the system of music ""DNA"" they use is better at creating channels that introduce you to new music."
42153,"Pandora",2014-11-17,4,"Great App But.....   This app is really cool for like parties and get togethers but most of the time when you done like a song as soon as you go to skip the song a ad pops up and you end up clicking the add and it lags your device. One thing I really like about Pandora is that when you give a song a thumbs down it says that they will never play that song again. I don't know if that's true. I really like this app you should get it"
42157,"Pandora",2011-12-31,3,"Pandora NO TuneIn YES   A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try.  It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)Why?First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSICJust sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right?  That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is.  Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, CajunYUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right?  WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world.  Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and  - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"".  Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied!  But wait?  What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257""  Wait??  You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback.  TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."
42158,"Pandora",2015-11-10,5,"Love it   Love Pandora and the great variety available for the song mix It's easy to use whether listening to one genre or choosing to shuffle.

42164,"Pandora",2014-06-16,1,"terrible   You shouldn't get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game, or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it wouldn't even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs, or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
42174,"Pandora",2016-06-23,1,"Needs to be updated   There's no app for phone, it times out, the setup is confusing, and the box that cost $200 doesn't show what bands are playing or channel. The channels,how ever, are amazing."

42185,"Pandora",2014-08-21,2,"Total noise and disruptive w/ the frequency and number of ads   The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app.  I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype, I was totally disappointed."
42187,"Pandora",2013-04-17,5,"Good free music product   I am enjoying exploration of this product to hear country music from the 50's.  I would recommend the free version.  I'm not ready for the monthly charge version yet!"
42189,"Pandora",2017-01-17,5,"I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it   I used to use slacker radio all the time but i have recently switched to Pandora just for the option to mix my stations together. I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it. I do wish it would be easier to use with other devices, I usually hook up my laptop to my TV to use my whole house sound system while I'm cleaning, it would be so much easier to just play it from the Playstaion."

42220,"Pandora",2013-08-10,1,"Disappointing   I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD. I enjoy classical music, and I set up a Mozart station.  It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?))  Then it played some Beethoven.  Then it played an ad.  Two pieces of music, and then an ad.  I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad.  I immediately removed it from my Kindle."

42234,"Pandora",2014-06-14,2,"variety   Pandora definitely has much more variety than your average radio station. All I listen to is Pandora now but I come across the same songs all the time. It seems as though they play only the popular songs or have no k n owing of any different miles  you have been listening for hours. I sometimes Mark the thumbs down on some songs and somehow they still play in time . I just wish they could come up with more updated songs and add more than what they've been playing."

42288,"Pandora",2015-02-25,1,"disappointed   At first Pandora was great, I loved it, heard songs I haven't heard since I was young. After about a month of listening; one song would come on and then two commercials, after that nothing. I have to back out of the app and start over. Then the same problem would occur. Can somebody tell me why?"
42292,"Pandora",2013-12-09,1,"Way too many comercials.   I don't mind a commercial a few times an hour, it almost like listening to radio - sometimes after 2 songs...

Also it is always on, you have to force close Pandora as well to completely turn off."

The app is very easy to use and well polished. You can even continue to enjoy the music after leaving the app.Pandora now had an alarm that can wake you by playing your favorite stations. If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try."

However eight times out of ten, the app &#34;is having technical difficulties&#34; or won't recognize the correct log in information. There is no mechanism to inform Pandora either via the app nor on the direct web site. I even contacted Amazon about the issue and there has been no impact at all.

42326,"Pandora",2013-03-08,5,"BEST IDEA EVER!!!   I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i didn't have to listen to ads anymore.  I have never been happier with any other music source.  As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100% of the time.  I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire,  It is the best thing that ever happened to Music.  Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down.  If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like.  It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved.  The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using.  It is just too great for words."

I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I've downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it's on MY Kindle which is open I don't see the need of a password."
42399,"Pandora",2016-07-18,2,"Ads ads ads   Too many ads, ads are too long, and I wish I had the ability to opt out of live performances. Hearing people scream ""WOOO"" the entire song isn't exactly pleasurable."
42407,"Pandora",2016-03-03,1,"SUDDENLY ISNT WORKING   For the past 3 days the app will open but the music won't play and I can't  do anything like try to pause and unpause it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still won't work! What can you do about this? The bar at the bottom that says how long the song lasts and how much of it has played just says 00:00 out of 00:00"
42412,"Pandora",2015-09-14,2,"Just a few things.   I would really love more skips. So would all of my friends.Less adds of course,the usual complaint.A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like.I would really like to be Abel to make a collection of songs to just put on repeat. If there is one pls tell me. I've looked everywhere."
42418,"Pandora",2015-09-06,5,"love it   I love it you get free music but there's only one thing i hate you need Wi-Fi it drives me crazy because at my house we dont got Wi-Fi but on the way to school i use the Wi-Fi my bus driver has but any way great app it has all the music u ask for get it its great"

I assumed I would like heaing music on my computer as well but I found the music distracts me for my activity.  That's why I only gave it three stars.  For a lot of people, this would not be  problem and in that case it deserves five stars."
42449,"Pandora",2012-09-17,1,"not what used to be   It started out really good but then it took a turn for the worst, it crashed multipule times. It stops in the middle of my songs and then their are ads after every song and the last almost as long as the songs. total waste of time. ive gone to slacker now."
42456,"Pandora",2013-12-21,4,"works fine on home entertainment center   Works just fine and is nice to have music we want when we want it.  Should have done this sooner."

42474,"Pandora",2013-04-06,2,"Not what I wanted   My problem with Pandora was that I wanted specific artists.  Pandora only offers a specific genre.  Not what I was looking for."
42477,"Pandora",2013-04-17,5,"WHAT CAN YOU SAY.....   Best product EVER.  If you love music, any kind of music, you must have Pandora.  We have it playing every evening at dinner.  Soft music, K Gee mostly, is our favorite.  Southern Gospel is great and I could go on and on.  GREAT...R. Hobbs"

42495,"Pandora",2013-11-17,1,"Slow   Before the most recent updates I loved Pandora. Now Pandora is super slow and takes at least 5 minutes to load. Compared to Iheart Radio which takes about 10 seconds. Until the next update I will be using Iheart Radio."
42496,"Pandora",2017-06-13,4,"The new way to listen to radio   Love the way you can choose exactly what music you want to listen to."
42498,"Pandora",2013-07-04,5,"Love this.   You should get this if you don't want to buy music. The only problem I have with this is that you need to have internet to use it so you can't us it when ever. but it is a really great app I love to use it when ever I can."
42499,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"Good Music   I like the music selection.  The only down side it that it appears to play the same songs each time you put in an artist."

42548,"Pandora",2012-11-20,4,"Same as the computer version.   It's the same thing as the original computer version of Pandora.  I still rate it a 4 instead of a 5 because I hate all the ads.  Oh well."
42550,"Pandora",2013-03-15,5,"best online streaming music ever   the choice is amazing and plays without a glitch. I wish it was offered in dubai also, perhaps the local ISP has blocked it and not pandora.It is the best where ever is it available."
42553,"Pandora",2013-06-05,1,"music   This app isn't the greatest only points you towards different stations not a app that you can listen to a particular song.  If I want to listen to a station I can turn on the radio. The search browser is crappie to. Wouldn't recommend this to friends."

42581,"Pandora",2016-06-23,1,"Don't buy   I ordered 2 charms from this seller and both looked ""worn"" for lack of a better word. There was very little detail. Not happy and will only buy from a jewelry store from now on. Total waste of money."

42629,"Pandora",2017-05-30,4,"Loud commercials.   They turn the music down low and the commercials way loud. It is worse than most FM tadio stations. Also the repetitive commervials are even more annoying."

42648,"Pandora",2015-10-21,3,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service   I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
42649,"Pandora",2016-01-31,1,"Skip Pandora.  You want SPOTIFY!   Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app.  And for a while, it met all my needs.  However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music.  If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice.  But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:PANDORA1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $4.99/month.3. Library size - 1 million+ songs.4. Can user pick song? NO.5. Can user skip songs? Yes.  But with limitations.  6 skips per hour, per station. No more than 30 skips in 24 hours.SPOTIFY1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $1 for 3 month trial.  Individual membership $9.99/month and each added family member gets 50% discount.3. Library size - 30 million songs!4. Can user pick song? YES!.5. Can user skip songs? YES!  NO LIMITS! :)"

42678,"Pandora",2013-01-17,2,"new version   The latest version is cumbersome.  The older version was so much easier to navigate.  The old version kept my stations in alphabetical order.  I didn't have to navigate to a different to quit.  I would not havr updated had I known this."
42682,"Pandora",2013-11-27,5,"Love Pandora!   Love the selection they choose to play based on the channels I create. Not too many advertisiments like other apps. And also like that they don't censor the lyrics."

42687,"Pandora",2014-04-05,1,"piece of junk   I like the idea of free music, but i would type in a song name and it would bring up a whole different song. It also is VERY VERY slow. Pandora can kiss my butt."

42749,"Pandora",2013-11-03,1,"SMH.   SO, I actually love when apps get updates, because I love to see all the new features that it contains. For this app, in particular...Well, let me first start off with this. I've been a huge Pandora fan, for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't.  I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you're about to lose a customer, if you don't get it together."

When you follow the link you cannot go to the Pandora web site even though the option is presented. You must go to the Amazon store which is frustrating in itself. At the Amazon store, you have to search for Pandora One and it then only finds Pandora. If you ever do get to Pandora One in the Amazon store it will not download or install. Pandora is great. Amazon Store is frustrating and I hesitate to use it"

42953,"Pandora",2014-12-27,5,"Love Pandora   I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended."

Or the surprise of hearing a band that Pandora choose in that same line-up that you love as well. We searched for two years for a server, never giving up the hope that we could install wt-fi to receive Pandora in our home. We live in a cabin in the mountains, very isolated, but we searched constantly until we finally found a server in an adjoining state!*!* That's how much I, we, love Pandora*★*"

43113,"Pandora",2017-08-15,2,"Dumbed down and prices raised = lousy annoying arrogant Pandora   Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons.  Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month.  Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out.  So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers.  Maybe it's ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music."
43115,"Pandora",2017-09-30,4,"LIFE= MUSIC   I love listening to music throughout the day and Pandora is a great app for it. I have it on multiple devices, my phone, multiple tv's. I like that there's a great variety and you can choose the style that fits you or your mood even. I listen to my 90's alternative when relaxing with the hubby, country through out the day and ( my little secret lol), old school hip hop when I'm alone and dancing in front of the mirror. Don't act like you've never done it lol ! I do wish that you could skip as many songs as you wanted to on the free version tho and of course it goes without saying, I wish it were completely free but I'm not complaining because it's a great app!"

I have been using this App for years, since my first iPhone 3G. This has been by far my favorite music app.+ Free! Who doesn't like free?!+ High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone.+ A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R&B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all.+ Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening.+ Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again.+ Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button!+ No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.Give it a try and you won't regret it. I have been using this for years and even after trying others, I prefer Pandora."

It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99.  That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."
43153,"Pandora",2017-04-09,4,"I like that there is no DJ   Less expensive than slacker. I like that there is no DJ. Not as detail as slacker, I just keep it on certain settings though and I am Fine. The realaxation station which I use at Night is excellent. I never heard music like that before. During the day I just set it to Led Zepplin and it plays music I like. The smooth jazz station was  good also."
43154,"Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet   After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best.  The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all).  Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.  Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music.  It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements.  Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
43159,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"love   cause it has everything i want.i would reccomend to everyone.i have tried other ones and they play what i like."
43160,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"GREAT   Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to"
43161,"Pandora",2016-10-29,4,"I love Pandora but...   Pandora has an amazing selection of radio stations and I'm so glad we can further edit them to our preferences! But I am saddened by the fact that if my kindle screen goes idle the music consistently skips unlike when the screen is active where it might skip once in an hour. Also different than my cell phone which doesn't skip at all. If it weren't for that issue this would likely be a five star!!!!"
43162,"Pandora",2017-03-01,5,"Pandora is the best entertainment value around.   I couldn't live without Pandora.  I subscribed.  Best entertainment value around."
43174,"Pandora",2016-09-29,2,"Pandora - I'll Pass   Pandora is my first streaming music experience.  The more I use it, the more I dislike it.  Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers.  There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres.  Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs.  This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content.  Don't subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over.  Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features."
43178,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"One of the best music apps!   We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."

43190,"Pandora",2017-06-18,5,"The original is still the best.   Great streaming channel with a wide variety of music."
43196,"Pandora",2014-12-12,5,"Discovered through my husband around 2011/2012   I admit that I cannot remember the exact timeframe that I discovered Pandora, but I believe that it was sometime around summer or autumn 2011 when my husband played music from the app during one of our quiet moments together.  I enjoy that there is a wide range of stations and music genres that one can listen to. I’m open-minded when it comes to willingness to listen to various types of music. Right now, the top three music stations that I am listening to on Pandora the most are chillout, electronica, and indie dance, although I have to humbly credit recently finding out about indie dance from a public relations specialist named heather whaling of geben communication- who listed indie dance being one of their fave stations online. Sometimes I go ahead and also shuffle the over 20 plus radio stations that are set in my Pandora profile in order to listen to satisfy  my eclectic tastes in music. Many of my online music purchases have been influenced by many of the songs and artists I heard on Pandora."
43206,"Pandora",2017-02-07,3,"Could use improvement   I enjoy Pandora, but it could definitely be better.  I do not like the loud commercials.  They are extremely irritating so I either turn off the sound or turn off Pandora when they come on.  Even more disconcerting is when I am listening to Jose Cura a nd other tenors, I suddenly get hit with Heavy Metal!  Definitely not in my comfort zone."

43219,"Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"Pandora rocks...or pops...or jazzes...whatever you want!   Pandora was recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional ""get started"" guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!"
43222,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Kindle Pandora App works great!   The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD.  I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian.  Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy.  Pandora definitely targets well."

43231,"Pandora",2012-07-08,5,"Why the Hate?   I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)"
43234,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"... long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up   It didn't take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear (not what a local station thinks that I want to hear). The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, 14 months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
43235,"Pandora",2016-05-08,5,"A Treasure Box of Music Just Waiting For You To Let Pandora Out of the Box   If you like music you can't beat this app. It plays only the types of music that you like to hear. If a choice of a song is not to your liking just give it a thumbs down and it is gone. I chose four different genres of music when I first got the app and listened for two hours and only snubbed two songs. I felt like it read my mind as to what I would play from my personal record collection. The ads are not that frequent  and do not last long either. Get this app now and you won't be sorry."
43237,"Pandora",2017-07-16,5,"why pay big bucks for xm/serius when you can listen for free !   dont pay for xm/serius when you have pandora for free ! much better when you can control your music with likes,and dislikes. and if you want more control you can pay $5 a month more and get it all !  luv it , luv it, can't get enuf of it !"

One good thing about Pandora is that the adds aren't as bad they don't show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer"

43247,"Pandora",2016-05-17,5,"Music Site Of Choice   I've used Pandora for many years. It's one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. It's not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. It's called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."

I use it often and because it's free it's even better."
43257,"Pandora",2017-01-24,5,"Best site for music   I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
43264,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Pilot of the Airwaves   Pandora is the best effort yet to allow each of us to be our own disc jockey. Take an artist, a song or a genre and use Pandora to build a total environment and system of sound. Simply sublime!"
43265,"Pandora",2013-02-28,1,"sucks   Disowned to Kindle Fire only displays the background. No functional use. Guess I have to wait and download at another time. That sucks!"
43267,"Pandora",2017-07-22,4,"Great service   Very cool.  I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice.  To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely."
43268,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Podcasts and music in one place   ""Serial"" podcasts and ""This American Life"". All the different channels. Very pleased."
43270,"Pandora",2017-04-18,5,"Love this app   Love this app - use it to stream music which saves space on my devices as I don't have to download music."
43272,"Pandora",2013-05-20,4,"Great Music App   I got this app years ago and loved it right away.  This app tailors the music to your liking. Unlike other music apps this one is don't just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts.  For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper.  The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs.  You have to purchase it to be commercial free."
43277,"Pandora",2017-09-29,5,"works well   The app works well. No complaints yet."
43279,"Pandora",2014-03-12,4,"Pandora Media   I turn on Pandora  from my Tablet and use a jambox for the sound via Bluetooth.. I am a subscriber and pay my monthly fee. Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart.  Sometimes it is really bad.  (I have no problems with Radio Paradise).  Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there.  Most annoying since it is not December but March.  It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars."
43284,"Pandora",2017-10-20,3,"Used to be a great product.   Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore (yet it doesn't need it to run?!)."

43288,"Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes   I've been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it's satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I'm on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."

43297,"Pandora",2014-08-19,5,"Great app, worth paying for no ads   Pandora is the best. Years ago when I first got it for my phone, I had a tedious desk job where the only thing you did all day was do the same repetitive data entry task, and so we were allowed to wear headphones. I paid the $4 a month (at the time that was the price - I'm not sure if that's changed) to take away the ads, and man was it worth it. Best $4 a month I'd ever spent. Listening to music at this job was one of the only things there that kept me sane."

43320,"Pandora",2014-03-25,2,"it's no longer Plucky-Little-Pandora   I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn.NO MORE.Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate.This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed.I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad.But I could have live with this change. I did  find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music..............[...]Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and look at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody.""People's music, movie or book choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are....Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million..............Just what, in fact is Pandora's business?It just creeps me out that my music is being used to profile me.I've uninstalled the app."

Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you're back to listening to your music preference.

I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."

The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's "" the seasons"" every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?"
43430,"Pandora",2013-03-07,5,"I love Pandora!   I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I don't like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I don't think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my ""stations"" from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I don't know."

43450,"Pandora",2016-11-20,5,"Five Stars   The music is so relaxing when I'm working around the house."
43451,"Pandora",2016-12-09,5,"Who doesn't love Pandora???   Free radio that I get to customize?!? My only complaint is when I say I will turn it off after the next bad song, but every song is good because I chose them all!!!!"
43453,"Pandora",2017-05-17,4,"Good   Good"
43455,"Pandora",2016-02-02,5,"Cough it up   I like the shuffle of the music I have chosen, but not the ads for prioposim or whatever Cialis is hawking or is that because they want you to become annoyed enough to spend money for no ad listening?"
43460,"Pandora",2016-09-19,5,"Love Pandora,   Love Pandora ,,, allows you to choose different genre's of music and you are also able to make your own playlists...which is just up my alley!!! A great selection of music .. LOve it!!!!"

I can pick the music I listened to growing up and then add in something different once  in a while. It is great for cleaning cleaning and relaxing."
43475,"Pandora",2017-08-06,5,"Thanks Pandora!!   Nice to have MY choice of music any time and any where!  Thanks Pandora!"
43476,"Pandora",2016-01-14,5,"very nice music listening   Pandora Radio is very good and high quality streaming music. the sound is crisp and clear and yes there are commercials but not as many as there are on other streaming music sites so you get more hours of uninterrupted music than anywhere else. highly reccomend"
43482,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"I thought i had one i liked until i fell in love with this one!!! :)   Love this, I did get to try at a discount for my honest review but will keep at the regular price! What a selection and I love all the choices, I listen all the time & am looking into speakers, I can play at night & not disturb the neighbors upstairs!"
43492,"Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"very happy   very happy with it , works well"
43497,"Pandora",2015-12-31,3,"Not the best but certainly not the worst   Just like most subscription services the music tends to repeat itself even with all the selections that they could match to my likes. It's a nice thing to have when I want to hear artists I am not familiar with but I prefer Google Play Music and Sirius XM."
43498,"Pandora",2017-08-02,4,"Four Stars   We like to use Pandora at the office for the background sound."
43499,"Pandora",2015-01-30,5,"Meet your new favorite radio app!   Great app, I love being exposed to new music based on artists I already enjoy. With your phone and a bluetooth speaker, you have a stereo anywhere and can create your own radio stations. I was never able to use it when traveling in other countries, which is frustrating, but I do understand about licensing rights, so I realize it's an unavoidable nuisance."
43500,"Pandora",2017-07-31,5,"Good App   I enjoy listening to the music, nothing really to say, its a good app."
43502,"Pandora",2017-03-25,4,"Four Stars   very good"
43505,"Pandora",2017-08-30,5,"Very Pleased   Wonderful library of classical and jazz"
43507,"Pandora",2017-05-04,5,"The Best   This is the most wonderful music channel ever. I listen at home on an internet radio, on the computer and especially in the car with a smart phone hookup. I have established an extensive playlist of the most beautiful music (at least to me) I could ever imagine. There is a cost outside of a Wi-Fi connection but to me it is worth every penny."
43515,"Pandora",2016-10-23,5,"Love it   Love it, listen to anything you want."
43518,"Pandora",2016-04-20,5,"I'm so glad I got it   Let me just say I have been enjoying Pandora for the past few days, I'm so glad I got it, I of course heard of Pandora, and friends and family have it, been telling me to get it I finaly did, my point is just get it and enjoy."
43519,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Unlimited love   Pandora as u promise the world u are connected in world so don't forget to help the a person in need"
43523,"Pandora",2013-12-12,5,"Great App with the ease of use and sound quality you want   Love it. It works even better than the one on my PC.  The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax. WELL WORK LOADING."
43525,"Pandora",2016-02-16,5,"Great music app   I have iHeart on my phone, but I prefer Pandora. I love being able to make new stations based on artist, genre, or even song. We listen to Pandora on our Roku most every day. Now if we could all just agree on what station to put on!"
43526,"Pandora",2012-11-28,1,"last chance   at first it would not shut off, had to shut down my kindle and restart to have pandora off. that was fixed(majic) but now it will go thru a whole song without making any sound come out of my kindle, unles you pause and un pause, sometimes more than once.  i have been using pandira on my blackberry for years without any of these problems. was gonna buy pandora one, but not with the way its acting. i uninstalled and reinstalled, this is your last chance pandora......"
43530,"Pandora",2017-07-19,4,"Four Stars   Thus far I like this. I have been listening to some classical music"
43532,"Pandora",2015-03-24,5,"GREAT!!!   Pandora is nice, had it a while back then switched to Spotify for a while and now switched back, Pandora suites me just as well, and its FREE!"
43535,"Pandora",2016-05-23,5,"Five Stars   plays just what I'm wanting to hear, but don't know all the artist...;-) to make the just right station"
43536,"Pandora",2015-05-10,5,"I love this app   This i believe is my favorite app ever! The music selections are great and sound quality is awesome! I have selected about 25 of my favorite artists and with each artist you get other artists that compliment each other. And the shuffle option means i can listen all day and only hear my favorite performers!"
43546,"Pandora",2013-09-12,5,"I didnt use it because of the quality when your not subscribed, works amazing though   I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
43548,"Pandora",2017-08-04,5,"Five Stars   Great app, one of the best sites around."
43553,"Pandora",2017-07-24,4,"Pandora Radio   Didn't like all the commercials.. but other then that its awesome..."
43554,"Pandora",2015-04-18,3,"Okay, lack of selection and limited skipping makes this not very useful   For my listening genres (electronic new age/relaxation/concentration), the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-)."
43556,"Pandora",2013-09-22,4,"Great way to hear new music!   I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
43559,"Pandora",2017-10-20,5,"I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from   I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."
43563,"Pandora",2017-07-01,5,"Great app any time   Good to have on my kindle fire for quick music"
43564,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"I've enjoyed Pandora very much   I've enjoyed Pandora very much.  A co-worker has it on her phone, and liked what I heard.  You have a variety of choices in music to choose from.  I'm very happy with it. I have it on my Kindle."
43566,"Pandora",2017-01-11,5,"awesome possum   As a Pandora One user, I have no complaints. I use Pandora as an alarm and I they have great suggestions for radio stations and adding songs to my existing playlists."
43576,"Pandora",2017-05-09,5,"great   I like this app cause it helps me sleep and i enjoy listing to the music that they provide me."
43578,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Great selection of music   Great selection of music. Pick your favorite artist and listen with very little interruptions. Short commercials are ok. I bought a Jam speaker and blutooth from my iPhone, working outside bring your music with you. This is a great way to listen to the music you love."
43580,"Pandora",2015-05-11,5,"radio   Great  for all your  listening  needs  very limited  commercials. .any type of music  you  can think  of."
43582,"Pandora",2015-05-30,1,"stop wasting your time and go to spotify.   Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! $4.99 a month!? It's barely worth a lifetime membership for $4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no ""are you sure"" screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership.  Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click.  It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on.  I used to enjoy the free version but didn't like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."
43583,"Pandora",2013-08-02,5,"Pandora App   Awesome app.  Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great.  Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best.  They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets.  Far and away the best. I definitely recommend."
43585,"Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"I love, love   I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
43591,"Pandora",2014-02-13,5,"I like my Pandora   This is a great app that you can configure to your style. You can thumbs up, or thumbs down songs to inform them of what music that you prefer. You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle.Hope that helps."
43593,"Pandora",2016-11-16,5,"Five Stars   5 stars"
43597,"Pandora",2015-12-09,5,"Great app for kids - even if you do have ...   Great app for kids - even if you do have to listen to a few ads periodically for the free version.  I like that you can choose any artist or song and the app will select other songs in the same genre to compliment your choices."
43600,"Pandora",2012-11-07,5,"Does what I have always wanted to do with my music   This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens.  It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."

43607,"Pandora",2015-06-04,5,"love, love, love Pandora   I grew up with radio and love the reduced advertising and great genres that can be created on Pandora.  I'm not really one to use ear buds since I'm an artist and need to be unencumbered when I'm working.  Just turn on the computer, plug in speakers and ""Bob's your uncle""!"

43628,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"Pandora Is Fantastic   I've been a Pandora fan for years, and now, having it on my Kindle makes discovering and listening to music much easier. Pandora is such a great thing; I will always be a fan."

I do not care for this one.I do not even understand why I would want to put all of my information online for someone else to see  and have not control over who sees it. I guess I am too private for this app. I believe it came with the Kindle as maybe some of the others on here for me to review that I do not remember downloading at all...I thank Amazon for the Free apps of the day!!!"

I could get a few songs to play and then it froze up. All I had wasa blue Pandora screen. I deleted the app for 3 days. Today I loaded Pandora appagain. Now it works perfectly the way I want, alot of music that I love made upinto stations that I can play any time. Plays on my Kindle Fire HD in the back-ground as I do other web searches,etc.  Wow this is great."
43656,"Pandora",2015-09-03,4,"A definite must if you like listening to music but limited number of songs.   I love Pandora. I listen to lots of different music, especially latin salsa, bachata, merengue.  I would give it a 5 except that in each venue, the list of music is limited.  You keep hearing the same songs over and over.  Pandora really needs to offer more songs."

43666,"Pandora",2015-09-04,5,"Lovin' Pandora   Not a day goes by that I don't play my favorite artists on Pandora.

43675,"Pandora",2017-10-28,1,"great for a few years   installed Pandora app for Kendle a few years ago.  worked great until a few weeks ago.  Now says it can't connect to Pandora.  Tried uninstall.  This moved the defective program to the cloud.  Told it to reinstall, so it recovered the defective program from the cloud, and it still doesn't work.  can't find a way to delete from the cloud and install a fresh (working) copy."
43678,"Pandora",2013-08-27,5,"All kinds of music   Have used Pandora both on PC, Laptop and now Fire. Splendid sound from the Fire; just keeps me either relaxing or rock and roll while working in the home."
43681,"Pandora",2017-08-10,1,"Play lists based on popularity rather than your personal taste.   Pandora sucks. Set up a ""station"" based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can't stand (guns and roses, ac-dc) because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless."

43696,"Pandora",2015-01-07,1,"Good site, but app contains a virus!   I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there's nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I'll be looking for another app for my Kindle."
43697,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T!I!T!... GET IT!!!   Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay $4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and doesn't have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."

43720,"Pandora",2017-03-29,1,"Service Please   Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"

43742,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"love it   If you don't have Pandora get it it works amazing."
43750,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"If you like music here it is.   Pandora allow you to somewhat pick the music that you like.  Somewhat being that if you like a song and indicate as a thumbs up you will get more of the style of music.  You don't really get to pick the music you pick the style or similar music.  If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like.  Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music.  It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it)  It is worth the download.  Try it"
43753,"Pandora",2015-05-27,3,"Great, but.......   Pandora is a great music player and I really enjoy using it. But I found out you need WiFi to use. If you know of a music player you can download on a kindle fire that doesn't need WiFi, plz contact me on Pintrest (Anna Thomas) or on Kik (Peppermentstick). Thank you. :)"
43761,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"Glitch?   I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up (not playing them) they just pop-up and don't stop until I close the app. I don't know if it's just my kindle or the app."
43764,"Pandora",2014-03-10,5,"Wonderful App   I have discovered so many great new artist using this program and my appreciation for music has grown!  Plus, it's not just music.  There are multiple comedy channels you can discover and that's all my husband and I listen to on long car drives.  We love it and I definitely recommend it to any one with a tablet, computer, smart phone, etc.  You wont regret it!  It is my favorite app!"
43765,"Pandora",2017-09-19,5,"Five Stars   Good content and relatively easy to navigate for me as a ""rookie""."

43769,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"Love Pandora!!!!   Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears.  Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
43777,"Pandora",2013-07-16,5,"Good vibes!   I love this app however, I DESPISE the commercials!  Yet how can Pandora pay the bills if I don't pony-up for a subscription for commercial free listening...but doesn't that defeat the idea of free internet radio?  Consequently, I'll endure the limited interruptions...it's better than FM.  I can select the style of music I'm feeling without having to slit my wrist from being subjected to the no talent, lack of common sense, Bieber."
43779,"Pandora",2015-04-29,5,"Good App   So far I have never had it ask with on the Kindle app if ""I am still listening"" so that it a huge advantage to listening to Pandora on the computer. If anyone else has had a different experience I am curious to know about it--so let me know."
43786,"Pandora",2016-12-14,5,"Enjoy Pandora   Pandora is fantastic. The music selection for each station is so enjoyable and creative. Listening to Pandora is loaded with pleasure."

43804,"Pandora",2017-06-03,5,"Better than listening to radio   Great music you can pick music to whatever mood you are feeling it is a good pick me up when you're feeling down I am happy very happy with Pandora"
43808,"Pandora",2013-05-02,5,"I love being able to listen to the kind of music I like   I love Pandora. It is very nice being able to listen to only music that you like. I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really don't plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like. By that I mean that if you put an artist on Pandora you may only have a small number of that artist's songs available. Therefore you may have to listen to 5 or 10 songs by that artist over and over."
43812,"Pandora",2015-09-07,4,"Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs   I've had Pandora on my computer for years.  Recently downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  Now all I have to do is figure out how to connect (again) to my bluetooth capable sound bar.  Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs."
43815,"Pandora",2013-05-14,5,"If you want to hear your music you will love Pandora   Pandora is free if you don't mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and don't like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations."

43828,"Pandora",2013-08-17,4,"Pandora   I love Pandora! It is free ( at least for now tho' I heard a rumor that they were going to start charging, at which time I'll cancel) and you are able to bookmark songs and groups, build a list of ""stations"" to listen to, and change and alter items according to your listening habits. My taste runs pretty eclectic from an Eddie Cochran station to Mumphord and Sons. So give a trial run and I think you'll become a Pandora fan."
43834,"Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Pandora in my vehicle, nice.   Have Pandora on Kindle Fire and PC, just added to cell phone to connect via Bluetooth with different vehicle.  Works great."
43836,"Pandora",2015-08-02,2,"Great Station if you Like South American Music besides American Music.   Being from Europe I was disappointed,  Spotify Music App. Has every music you will love, from every country.  Pandora is for not for a European  American, like me. I like different stations, I do listen to American Music,  Pandora has also South American Music, which is not for me."

43852,"Pandora",2013-03-17,2,"Don't bother with phone app!!!  Read below for a great desktop trick.   Used to be the shizzle for the phone.  Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream.  WTF?  And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month.  I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc.  40 hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads.  You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review.  On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads.  UNLESS . . .  you know a trick, like I do.  And yes, it's completely legal.For your home pc, Google ""Adam Haile Elpis"".  Click on the first hit.  Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora.  In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora.  Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things.  1- it allows you to have unlimited skips.  2- it will not download any ads.  In other words, it simulates the pay service.YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"

43887,"Pandora",2013-03-29,5,"Stellar app!   What can a person say about a music service that customizes one's listening taste into an intuitive music playback service?  It's great and worth having, unless  you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again.  Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music.  In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU!  How good is that!?"
43894,"Pandora",2015-11-17,4,"Pandora at it's best!!!!   I enjoy getting on Pandora. It allows me to explore different types of music and develop my own playlist. It allows me to sit back and listen to a group I might have overlooked previously so then I can go from there and experience different groups that are somewhat alike. I just don't like the ""ads interruption"

With Pandora I can choose what I want to listen to ..it's truly wonderful."
43904,"Pandora",2013-10-18,4,"Fun Radio is here!   I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to.  I particularly enjoy being able to put in the artist or song and up it pops, though I get bored pretty quickly when the same type of music keeps coming.  Still, it's a must have for those who enjoy 'listening' to radio!"

I used this app with my old kindle and experienced similar problems.  I thought it was the kindle, but clearly there is an issue with the app.  PLEASE FIX IT.

But a lot of the times it will freeze or I've also encountered issues where it doesn't fully play the song and skips to the next. AND THE BUFFERING! Forget it! I will have a perfect connection and this will still occur. The ads also freeze up the program, too, I feel. Hopefully they will come out with an update that fixes this, unless it's just an error I'm receiving with my LG Optimus S."
43954,"Pandora",2015-01-28,2,"great till ads randomly started playing   I enjoy this app a lot with the shuffle feature and constant music.

43965,"Pandora",2014-04-19,4,"Good service, annoying ads.   Pandora has a good service and exposes me to artists that I might not normally find. I like the ability to rate music I'm listening to, with thumbs down going away, forever. I wish there were a way to change that, though, and if there is I've not found it. The ads are obnoxious, though - not only do you have to listen to them but they pop up in app and are very easy to inadvertently trigger. Really guys? Can't just pick one way for ad delivery? Also kind've lame considering you, Pandora, do not pay a lot of the artists for the media usage rights, but we'll just see how the court case pans out on that one.  I hope you get it figured out and survive because I really enjoy the service you provide."
43966,"Pandora",2012-09-05,4,"Love it   it used to work nicely on my G-Tab (honeycomb), but since this last update I only get a blue screen.  hopefully this will get resolved soon?

Therefore, I am back to the 4 stars that this great APP deserves."

Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web.  But they're short compared to commercial radio.  And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all.

While there are other ""free"" radio apps...none offer the selection of genres, artist that Pandora does.  One example..go to Iheart radio and put in Boy George.. has nothing ..BUT WI T H PANDORA I GOT CULTURE CLUB RADIO..THE SMALL YEARLY FEE IS WORTH HAVING NO COMMERICIALS AND THE BEST POSSIBLE SELECTION."

Other songs show up more than the radio station Songs which forces me to skip then when my skips run out and a horrible song comes on I have to go to another station and listen to another station and deal with it again2. I have read reviews of Pandora and most songs are not complete only one song occurred that was itI'm mostly taking the song issue more than the complete songsPandora stop picking your noses and fix these problems so we could keep listening and give you guys positive reviews its more simple than you think to do it I would be more than happy to delete and start listening to slacker etc"

Ok so it could be a special that comes for a week then comes back 2 months later for a week. The special should be that we can have a station that is called my bookmarks and the station should be about where you can listen to your bookmarks in any order and you listen to just your bookmarks.I hope this sounds interesting to you so I hope that maybw you can try it out if you dont lile it you dont have to keep it THANKS,a listener...."

Then all of a sudden I couldn't access.  It just seems like it is constantly in scan mode during the daytime hours.  It returns a message that my station will be back in a minute.  At night I can access.  But that doesn't help me at work during the day.  If I could access it more regularly, I would give it 5 stars cause I love the concept."

I reached out to Pandora and they told me they wouldn't refund any of the charges because of their Terms and Conditions. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.

It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission.  I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."

I don't like the blasts of 15-second ads you have to put up with when you have a free account. I was delighted to learn I could put Pandora on my iPhone. That app is free, so you can't beat the price! I have the iPhone with me everywhere, which I definitely cannot say about my desktop, so with this app I am using Pandora far more than I ever did before.As for Pandora itself, I like that I can set up many different ""channels,"" and Pandora will play a constant stream of similar types of music within a given channel. I can also change channels anytime I like. I often play a channel with rousing music first thing in the morning to wake me up, and a channel with soothing music while preparing for bed."

For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version.  the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement.

44424,"Pandora",2013-05-05,4,"Love!   One of my favorite apps. Only negative things I can this of are that the thumbs down, and up are close by each other, so toddlers accidently press the wrong button. Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They aren't as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."
44427,"Pandora",2014-03-15,3,"A nice way to hear old favorites.   I enjoy being able to find songs that are not played on the radio any more, and to focus on my favorite singers.  The visual ads are not too annoying but the audio ones are."

44535,"Pandora",2017-07-22,5,"Five Stars   C'mon its Pandora what else needs to be said?!?!?!?"
44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about those ads, (about those ads) no music   So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone.  I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow.  But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for.  But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad.  I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well.  Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track.  I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing.  In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."
44541,"Pandora",2017-07-22,2,"Pandora needs to change limited skip bs   Its okay. Used to pay for it. Finally stopped paying for it. Supposedly they offer unlimited skips.  Which they said they had before. They still probably don't. Thwy let you skip 5 songs and say sorry we know you're sucker and paid for this but we aren't lerting you hear just what you want. Here are a few songs that are free that suck listen to them. Oh you made a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you'll hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha."
44546,"Pandora",2016-11-16,5,"Five Stars   Many música to listen love it."
44550,"Pandora",2012-07-22,5,"Love It!   Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course, so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all.  You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations.  And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I've had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion.  I also play it on my home computer.  Its free and I love it."

44679,"Pandora",2013-12-19,5,"radio my way   Pandora is like radio my way.  Almost as good as an ipod.  I wonder why they chose this name, you know with that box and everything that came with it.  That name should have been saved for something bad."
44683,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"Love!   I love Pandora!  I listen to comedy in the morning, dance while I'm cleaning house.  The variety is great and I get to try out new artists and genre for free.  Keep up the good work!"
44691,"Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Very happy   It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around.  I less frequently listen to my recorded music now.  The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service.  Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker.  Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
44692,"Pandora",2014-04-25,5,"Personal heart-warming radio station   Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear.  By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, (or group of artists) - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre.  Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our  mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves.  Best of all it's free."
44694,"Pandora",2013-08-15,3,"Pandora the app that used to be great   I was introduced to Pandora by a friend and fell in love with it. I constantly listened to music on it.  then one day I was cleaning my room and had been listening for a while then an artist that I do NOT like came on I tried to dislike it but the song continuedbto to play so I tried to skip it but I had already used the 6 skips in one hour the app is a great idea yet very expenseive and sucks battery I would have made this a five star review yet I just couldn't because if all the troubles I've had with this app."

The second was I song I loved but couldn't figure out theName.The only thing I have to criticize is that there are a lot of pop up ads but you canFix that by upgrading but it costs money.GO PANDORA!"
44747,"Pandora",2017-09-04,3,"Three Stars   Pandora is a good product, but in order to get the best quality, you must pay for use."
44750,"Pandora",2014-02-07,5,"A great value of entertainment and serendipitous listening joy.   Pandora is a joy to use and an incredible value for free (with ads) or for a small monthly fee (ad-free). I love that I can create multiple ""stations"", specify a few artists to ""focus"" the programming, and just sit back and enjoy the surprising and almost always spot-on results. A refreshing change from my downloaded albums, annoying commercial radio, and horribly repetitive satellite broadcast options.  Love Pandora!  Thank you.  Pandora."
44752,"Pandora",2016-02-03,1,"love Pandora, not working on kindle fire   I love Pandora asks have it on all my devices. Recently it just won't play on kindle. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the troubleshooting tips they suggest. Nothing works. Not sure if it's the app or its comparability with kindle fire so one star rating for now."
44756,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"Awesome Music Experience!!!   I upgraded to Pandora|One and I absolutely love it!!! Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I don't want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic! It is well worth the monthly subscription fee, and not nearly as expensive as other internet radio options. I highly recommend this to any and all music lovers! You won't be disappointed!!!"
44759,"Pandora",2015-10-07,4,"Pandora App   Link via iPhone or Kindle Fire. Sometimes a lengthy pause between selections but that is probably the Time Warner internet connection. Fidelity is enhanced by linking iPhone or Kindle Fire via a Bluetooth speaker. Comparable to Prime Music although Prime Music is better in that I can access my playlists"

44793,"Pandora",2014-01-13,5,"The best music ever!   Pandora has the largest collection of music on the web. I love how you can customize your stations and the service can adapt to your preferences. The commercials are short on the free service and not too obtrusive. I have had few technical problems and I use it on my computer, Kindle and cell phone. I have a BA in Musicology and I sincerely love this service as it reminds me of all the great music I studied in college."
44797,"Pandora",2012-08-06,3,"ads ruin it.   I don't really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc. I don't want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around. the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing, you cant close them! the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you'd clicked on the ad itself. I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app."
44798,"Pandora",2015-02-06,4,"Great music   Sometimes this shows you bands/music you've never given a chance.  Turns you onto new stuff while listening"
44801,"Pandora",2017-07-27,5,"yaaass   I love this app this may not be helpful but I do not care bye : ) !!!!!!!"
44809,"Pandora",2013-08-20,4,"choosing music   I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to set up a station with my favorite artists!  I am a country fan and while I enjoy all the different artists, I have ones that I really love and Pandora allows me to listen to them more often. I haven't explored all the options but am enjoying learning and listening. Thank you!"
44810,"Pandora",2016-05-22,3,"Good. But not on the new Kindle Fire.   Couldn't get it to work on my new Kindle Fire. I really like Pandora and the amount of music you can listen to, but I'd be better off using my computer or phone t use it."

44814,"Pandora",2017-04-28,3,"MOSTLY ANNOYING   I don't care for Pandora for this reason;  You create a station with an artist.  I thought I would only be listening to that particular artist.Unfortunately, Pandora takes it upon themselves to add other artists that they consider to be of the same genre.  I am passionate about my music and I resent having a computer tell me what to listen to.  For instance, I may want to listen to Bob Dylan only, there are a few Dylan songs and then suddenly I'm listening to Bruce Springsteen.  Can't stand that.  I would like to pick my own music which is why I stick with ITunes."
44815,"Pandora",2015-09-20,3,"I love pandora but.....   When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."
44818,"Pandora",2013-01-13,4,"Music maker...   I love pandora for it's innovative and versatile service's they provide in their program. I love being able to create my own station's, music I want to hear the music I grew up on. Thank's Pandora, Your Awesome..."
44828,"Pandora",2014-10-29,1,"Such a let down. ..not the service...just the licenses.   I can't believe they let me download this app when it isn't even available in the UK. As soon as I opened it it has a warnine screen saying it is not available in the UK. And I LOVE Pandora don't get me wrong. But it was a big letdown after getting my hopes up that I would finally be able to get Pandora in the UK. Total bummer."
44833,"Pandora",2014-04-19,4,"LOVE!!   It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!"
44840,"Pandora",2017-05-08,5,"Excellent   I can listen to the music I like. I like to listen to music when I am heading to work.  I just put on my headphones and listen to somethingrelaxing."

44843,"Pandora",2017-11-09,5,"music lover   my favorite way to listen to music now."
44848,"Pandora",2013-01-04,5,"Great Quality!   I just recently purchased the Pandora app since I have a Pandora account that I have been using on traditional computers.  Pandora will continue to play in the background even if the app is not open and you are working on other things.  In addition, I started to watch a movie trailer while Pandora was playing.  Pandora actually muted itself while the trailer was playing and picked back up right when the trailer was over.  I didn't have to do anything!  What a smart and convenient app!"
44852,"Pandora",2013-07-10,3,"Pandora   Thought it was free music? Not. I guess nothing much is free (apps)on the Kindle fire, but I'll deal with it."
44853,"Pandora",2017-05-17,4,"Four Stars   I'm using it, but I don't know how."
44854,"Pandora",2015-06-12,1,"Pandora couldn't fix the problem!   Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone.  I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working.  I contacted them and they are unable to figure-out what is wrong.  I am cancelling my service and going with another provider."
44859,"Pandora",2014-02-06,5,"Variety is endless   My husband has thousands of songs in his library.  This allows me to customize the music I like and find like artists I might enjoy.  Having a ball using Pandora."
44863,"Pandora",2012-01-07,4,"great app, odd skipping problem   this app does its job: delivers the Pandora experience on kindle fire.  free tunes customized the say you like without having to micromanage your playlist.i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads,  but I really cant get upset about that for free music.  would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour.one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up.  hopefully they'll fix this with an update.  but for this, would give five stars."
44866,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"Awesome app   Love how you can add to or create a channel to fit your preferences."
44871,"Pandora",2017-09-18,5,"87 loves the music of the lZgd SSÁQ1Q   Better than listening to the TV."

44882,"Pandora",2015-01-13,5,"Five Stars   Great product and service"
44883,"Pandora",2015-08-29,5,"Mixing stations   It's good to have all my old favorites to listen to. I have been a listener for a few years now. The only negative to Pandora is it seems to mix stations with other favorite channels. Such as the B52's and Jethro Tull on the same channel."
44885,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"So such better than it used to be   Easier to use and the playlists I can actually listened to from beginning to the end"
44887,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Grsat choice of music"
44889,"Pandora",2017-08-29,5,"😁   Excelente"
44891,"Pandora",2013-01-02,4,"Can never go wrong with a free music app   I have this on my both my internet TV and my tablet.  The music choices usually (but not always) stay true to the type of music played by the original artist you've chosen.  Surprised, though, that there is no choice for Beethoven or some of the other Classical greats, but it may be that my search capabilities aren't that great when searching for artists and music.  Even so, it's a great way to add the kind of music you like."
44892,"Pandora",2015-04-22,4,"Great app   I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music. On the down side you have to pay for add free listening but sometimes the adds aren't even bothering. Overall it is a great app and I recommend it."
44893,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"Pandora   Excellent! Love it."
44894,"Pandora",2017-10-10,5,"Best music app by far   Best music app by far! The genres, options and settings are plenty! Easy navigation and almost always plays the music I actually like!"

Ony one week and I can't get to my favorites because they are always pushing crappy music into my phone that I can't get rid of unless I shut my phone off and start over."

44911,"Pandora",2015-05-28,2,"ADS   I'm sorry but way too many adds.I just can't use it anymore.so I use spotify.I am actually listening to it while I review.and I can tell you there where no ads for a whopping 15 minutes.compared to Pandora that is such a big difference."

I use it all the time like right now I'm listening to over the rainbow ( love the song) I recommend that you get this app and it's free so if you don't like it you won't waste your coins or money. I recommend it to music fans. Pick any genera any song and it's there. If you don't believe me try it for yourself. ITS FREE!!!!!!!!"

44936,"Pandora",2013-01-02,3,"Doesn't really play what you want   I really enjoy listening to music and I like the idea that you could chose the artist you want to listen to. However, if I type a specific artist I hate the fact that you listen to one of their songs and then a different artist comes on. They don't play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. They'll play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I don't really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music...."
44939,"Pandora",2013-09-14,5,"One of the nicest things   Pandora is one of the things in my life that never disappoints. I have had no problem with reception on my devices. With it's astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections. In a lull at a recent party of mine someone talked about skating to a song and before you knew it we created a play list of the song and everyone was rocking and telling stories for the rest of the night."

44961,"Pandora",2013-10-08,3,"Does what it is supposed to, with one pretty big bug   It plays music as it should. Very easy to add stations and all the things you can do with iton the PC. But on the kindle, I need to go to the settings and log off before I shutdown, otherwisewhen it starts back up, it freezes on the opening blue screen and I need to remove it from the deviceand re-download from the cloud to get it to work again - after reinstalling you get the login screenlike you would if you had logged off.So, its ok, its just that you can't remain logged in, and that's a bit inconvenient."
44963,"Pandora",2015-04-15,5,"I love Pandora!!!   It is so great when I can turn on Pandora and go to a station that plays only songs that I want to here, this app has a station for everyone even people who like to listen to instrumental where it's just like a brass symphony or brass set.

I can choose jazz, classical, classic rock and roll, gospel, or any type I want. Or, I can choose anyone from Michael Buble to Arrowsmith! It's a wonderful place to escape or have as a companion while working at the computer."
44983,"Pandora",2013-06-04,5,"Pandora has revolutionized my appreciation of music --this app is way superior to using a browser   It expands my musical horizons as well as letting me listen to my established favorites ... This app is well-designed."
44988,"Pandora",2016-03-01,4,"too much to get in   What's with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it's like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that's too hard to do while I'm driving. HATE IT!!"
44991,"Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"Five Stars   Great music"
44992,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   It's great. Only problem is I wear down my batteries all the time."
44995,"Pandora",2016-02-13,5,"Mom approved   We use this all the time to find jams to party or sleep to, toddler approved. I especially love the rockabye channel, nice lullaby versions of green day, guns n roses, and Dr. Dre. Good times."

45022,"Pandora",2012-11-21,5,"For everybody pondering wether to buy it or not>>>>   This app is amazing! For every hour you listen to Pandora Radio, you can skip 6 songs. So if a song you don't like comes on, you can skip it! Also, if you type in a band or something like Maroon 5, it'll play songs similiar to Maroon 5 along with Maroon 5 itself. :) Get it! Also, the ads are usually every 3-5 songs. They are only 10-15 seconds long typically. They have ads so they can pay for the songs they play! Please get this app!"

45024,"Pandora",2016-03-02,3,"I am still learning HOW to use this Pandora. ...   I am still learning HOW to use this Pandora.  Sometimes I cannot get it to play for long periods of time!  then suddenly it will start playing!What am I NOT doing right??  this is a new product to me!"
45025,"Pandora",2013-08-29,4,"Pandora is good....   Pretty cool to listen to genres you like....love how it customizesyour playlist based on your ""likes""....will use Pandora often...."
45027,"Pandora",2016-02-05,3,"music lover   Its good so far wish i could play back my fav songs without going through all the radio stations, but i like the continuous play dont like tht they stop u from skipping"
45038,"Pandora",2017-01-30,5,"I love it and the whole family uses it for all ...   I love it and the whole family uses it for all our music needs. I don't know the last time I even listened to regular radio."
45040,"Pandora",2012-07-20,4,"Almost Perfect   The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it's extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a 3 minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you're on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it's a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed."
45044,"Pandora",2014-01-19,3,"Didn't get what I was expecting   The product information indicated it was a 10-pack; 20 batteries, but I only received a 5-pack (10 batteries).  It's too much trouble to complain so I just learned a lesson and will not order this item again."
45056,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"great music but has flaws   Pandora has great quality, but when you make a station it will play a lot of different artists. Not even 50 percent of the music is the artist the station is supposed to play. You can skip songs, but you only get a certain number of skips. It also has adds. You have to pay $4.00 monthly to get no adds and other things that may annoy you. Overall it's a very nice app."
45057,"Pandora",2015-08-17,5,"great app   I am 12. And I think that this app is the best app I have on my kindle. I believe there is literally only one flaw: Not everybody has it!!! Once again, I totally love this app. Five stars from me. ♥♥♥♥♥"
45059,"Pandora",2013-09-10,5,"Great Music Service   Pandora has successfully made an app that oust all the other music/radio to shame. Only the quick advertisements take away from what is fluid and complety personal listening experience. On top of that Pandora continues to before better and better updates keeping the music fresh and the features applicable to what you look for on the app. Overall Pandora dwarfs all other radio apps."
45060,"Pandora",2012-04-02,5,"My dear Pandora   It took me a while to really love Pandora.  I don't know why.  Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true.  It really is as simple as that.  Well, Pandora, I think I love you.I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  I love just about everything.  One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'.  As far as I know, this app cannot do that.  Also, hate the ads...but I deal with them for free awesome radio."
45063,"Pandora",2017-01-30,5,"Five Stars   Hands down the greatest music app to date..... Thanks pandora!!!!"
45067,"Pandora",2016-02-02,5,"The best!   I dropped Sirius because their music is 70 years old! They are so out of touch their ""Chill"" station is all vocals!  If I create an instrumental station on Pandora, I won't hear a lyric for hours."
45068,"Pandora",2012-08-02,4,"I'm in love  BUT   Ok i'm 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me.  Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire.  I love it.  I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist.  And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again.  It remembers.  The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder.  The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing.  Sometimes I don't want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc.  I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."
45069,"Pandora",2017-10-30,5,"Five Stars   Great variety of music! Also a great price; $4.99/mo. with no commercials - gotta love that!"

45074,"Pandora",2017-01-18,5,"Variety and navigable.   I enjoy the variety of artists and music. Depending on the venue and activity my music tastes vary. The app is easy to navigate."
45076,"Pandora",2016-11-08,5,"Five Stars   Cool."
45080,"Pandora",2013-11-15,3,"Love it for the most part - BUT having trouble viewing movies due to network problems.   We like it because we don't have cable... the free shipping is great.  But have had some trouble with the network in watching the movies."
45081,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Variation of musical styles a real plus   Select performers that reflect the mood you're in and enjoy. An occasional click to say like or dislikewill have various types of music well managed."
45086,"Pandora",2017-05-23,5,"Five Stars   Love it, wish I could get complete albums on it"
45088,"Pandora",2013-02-18,5,"Fantastic-I love it   I always listen to Pandora now when I can get it through a hotspot at the gym. If I can't get it then I will listen to my songs that I have downloaded."
45089,"Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Five Stars   I enjoy listening to all the old classic music without having to download it"
45096,"Pandora",2016-01-22,1,"Stopped working   Have had Pandora on my Kindle Fire for months and listened every night. Two days ago it stopped working and I haven't been able to get it to work since. Works fine on my phone. Very annoying."
45099,"Pandora",2017-10-24,5,"Five Stars   Im very satisfied with the items"
45101,"Pandora",2013-01-28,5,"Wow! FREE MUSIC!!!!!!   wowza this app is amazing!!! it is like having free music! similar to iheart radio, but you get to skip the songs six times an hour per station (unlike iheart radio, where you only can skip a few times for the whole app a day or something like that) . it is like having free music! plus, you get your own profile where you can even look up song lyrics and artist profiles! love this app! you must get if you want FREE MUSIC!!!!"
45111,"Pandora",2014-01-30,4,"Pandora   I love the new Pandora app. This keeps you from having to spend your money on separate pieces of music when you barely use them or you get tired of the song and wasted your money. If you like Pandora on your computer, you will love it on your Kindle. The only bad thing is that rarely it freezes, but when you restart or just exit and come back to it, all goes back to normal."
45114,"Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Great!!   Love music therefore this is a perfect product for me."
45116,"Pandora",2016-01-13,2,"Ugh, no play history!   No idea why this app is different from other Pandora apps, if you like a song or dislike it you have to rate it when it is playing you can't view played songs.  And the screen saver is ugly."
45117,"Pandora",2013-01-27,5,"Pandora is wonderful because you hear the music you love......................   For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists.  Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song.Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it."
45118,"Pandora",2016-04-08,5,"Five Stars   Great place to buy music"
45126,"Pandora",2013-09-04,4,"Music to sweat by !   Pandora is great for the gym.  I can listen to all types of music and it makes my workout go by faster and more enjoyable."

45137,"Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"Great music choice works fine on Kindle Fire Hd   Pandora is great and it seems to learn my musical tastes the more I use it. works fine on Kindle fire hd."
45143,"Pandora",2014-10-04,1,"worst app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Whenever I want to open my one direction radio, it says Pandora has stopped. It won't let me listen to meatloaf, acdc, led zeplen, or foreigner, Styx, journey, Boston, Don felder, the eagles, or any of my favorite bands. I'm a ten year old and I'm getting so frustrated with this app."
45146,"Pandora",2016-08-25,5,"I love Pandora they have a great selection of music   I love Pandora they have a great selection of music. My daughter plays it all the time so I got it. better than the radio at times."
45153,"Pandora",2012-12-03,2,"pandora problems   I use to love pandora it was a great way to listen to music and get a great variety of the artists i love but lately on my kindle and phone with the upgrade ill be playing a song the song will end and the app will  not be running so i have to unlock my device and go to the app and wait an additional 30 sec. to listen to music its aggravating and is a waste of time fix the problem or your going to loose a customer"
45154,"Pandora",2013-07-13,5,"Efficient control over what you listen to   What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel.  You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy.  Lots of programs can play one group over and over.  Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."
45155,"Pandora",2015-05-11,4,"Four Stars   fun"
45157,"Pandora",2013-01-13,5,"couldn't do housework without it   I use this app more than any app combined. I use the top comedian station and immediately I forget about whatever I am doing and am entertained the whole day. A+ app"
45158,"Pandora",2013-06-20,5,"My house has been redone by Pandora   Every time I paint a room, I've done it with Pandora blasting.  With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home.  The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends.  We are home."
45162,"Pandora",2014-11-30,5,"Five Stars   Great for any type of music lover!"
45165,"Pandora",2016-10-22,4,"eh...   I wanted an an app for soundcloud, but it wasn't available. This app has done well for being a second best."

45176,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"song options and lists   I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back toThe songs that you just listened to. Also I don't like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"
45179,"Pandora",2017-01-04,5,"Pure enjoyment   I love the ability to listen to classical, jazz, 50's, 60's, 70's music, and all my favorite artist at the touch of my finger."

45183,"Pandora",2014-02-16,5,"Love Pandora   I just love Pandora and am really digging the new built-in alarm clock!  So pleasant to awake to music.  The suggestions are intuitive and I have found some fabulous music.  A friend recently had me add the Classical Guitar station. It is an awesome acoustic addition to my daily mix."

45213,"Pandora",2015-07-12,5,"Dont know, my son says it the best???   Gone. I've downloaded this several times, 1NC here, several from playstore. In weeks weeks I didn't use so gone, deleted. My son is 31 and it's his favorite way to hear music. Best I can do. I just want a phone. I done want to listen to music from my phone"
45222,"Pandora",2014-02-11,5,"music is the best   this is a great app.  I love that I can find classical music and jazz and all the genres I could ever want.  I'm using it now while typing this reviews."
45224,"Pandora",2012-04-07,3,"the skips   when I first installed Pandora, it was amazing but then when it automatically upgraded, the things I liked about it changed. before the upgrade, if I were to skip six times I could quit Pandora then start it again and would be able to skip all over again.now after the upgrade if I skip six times and quit,I cannot skip again.what is the point in listening to the music you want to hear if you cant skip the music you DONT want to hear."
45225,"Pandora",2013-01-25,5,"Booyah Reviews   Hello I am Booyah reviews and u will see me on reviews more often. Welcome back! This app ""Pandora"" is probably the most popular music app on the app store! I love the music and theres no problems except one! You can only skip 6 times on each music station you add but its not that big of a deal because they have any music you want! I hope you like this app as much as i do!!"

I listen to it about everywhere. Usually I listen when I'm playing bad piggies,my little pony,or survival craft.Usually I also listen to Steadman5 radio.3 words for le app:this.is.epic. -derpy hooves"
45248,"Pandora",2011-12-27,5,"Got complaints? No!   this app has worked perfectly for my kindle fire. the only adds I've encountered are small little ones at the bottom of the screen that can be exited out, makes no sound, and doesn't interrupt the flow.of.music. I'm getting full, clear songs, too, and this app has done a great job of selecting the music I like. you can even bookmarks songs and artists. My only complaint is that you can't access your list of bookmarks until you sign in online."
45250,"Pandora",2014-09-09,5,"awesome music app!   this app is awesome because you can get as many stations as you want and you can get followers and follow Ppl to see what are there fav music. if you don't want that you can have a private account and just use it for music. I LOVE HEAVY METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
45253,"Pandora",2014-03-09,5,"Music the way I want it   I have been using Pandora on my laptop for years, I can't imagine why I have waited to get it for my phone for so long.  I had tried to download this app from the Pandora website several weeks ago, but was completely unable to.  The one thing that is certain about Amazon is that when you download an app from Amazon, you have got it.  Quick & easy, that is the way it should be , and is with Amazon."
45262,"Pandora",2017-01-07,1,"Done   This app on my kindle fire is the only one that will not load. I have tried turning off my device, disconnecting and reconnecting to WiFi, and uninstalling and reinstalling, but nothing has worked so I'm uninstalling permanently."

45296,"Pandora",2013-01-29,2,"confused...   It's doing a lot better with the skipping problem. Maybe I was listening too much? I don't know. But now I turn Pandora on, and the option to zoom out to view bios, lyrics, and how the song relates to your selection is gone. What the heck? That means that I also can't go back and view songs that I liked but didn't catch the name of I. time. Not cool.~Kindle Fire?"

One of the primary reasons why I like it so much is that I have some control over what I may want to listen to. Definitely 2 thumbs up."
45361,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Loved having it on while I worked!   It came through just like from my computer, phone or TV. I love using it on my fire because it doesn't use data like my phone."

45367,"Pandora",2017-01-10,2,"Used to be a great app   What was once a great app starts to spiral downwards. The same music gets played again after an hour or 2. No variety in music anymore. When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music."

I also get frustrated when the volume from one station is different than the next.  One minute it's a nice volume, the next song is LOUD!"
45395,"Pandora",2017-08-01,4,"then I'd love this app   If Pandora didn't have so many commercials, then I'd love this app. But, Amazon Music is love for me. :)"

45401,"Pandora",2015-06-19,5,"Awesome   This app enables me to listen to whatever I want to it rocks whoever doesn't like it is totally missing out on the fun it brings you on Friday night party's and random gigs!!"
45402,"Pandora",2012-12-12,5,"why are there so many complaints?   I love Pandora (and not just cuz I'm 11(I didn't change the User name) it gives a great verity and when I like songs,  it remembers and plays them again it learns what you like. plus,  I don't even see slacker radio on the ""top free"" section. so tut should prove that Pandora is better than slacker.(even though ive never listened to slacker)"
45406,"Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Five Stars   It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"

Please fix this app Pandora.  I love the content but this app is awful.  And even seeing as there have been quite a few complaints about the same problems,  you don't seem to be in a hurry to fix it."
45414,"Pandora",2012-05-18,1,"FAIL!   I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I'm lucky if I hear more than 30 seconds.

Once in a while an add will come up saying Why adds and then explains. 10 times or more in a song you have too close out a mini add and if you miss the x it will take you to the company's website.

45458,"Pandora",2015-08-01,4,"woukd reccomend this to my friends!   It let's you pick your groups, and any song you do not like, can be changed (stopped) to something you should like ( only so many times though), that is the only part that needs to be changed! But this is totally free, which is quite nice!"

I love this app. very limited commercials. if you are planning to get I heart radio get this instead. one problem you may dislike though is the ads and you only can skip 6 times an hour. I like how you can skip like three times and it will play a different song. you also can go to a particular type of person. for example, you can go to the selena Gomez station."

45488,"Pandora",2013-08-07,3,"stop with the ads   Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."

I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure.

45865,"Pandora",2013-01-25,4,"I have a bit of trouble holding the stream..but I like the library of music   I love the different venues of music to choose from..and I am in the middle of changing providers as the old one has no space left on satelite..so my computer is really slow..I can't wait to share this site with friends and family!"
45866,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"i love it   ilove it it has great songs and you can look up what ever station you want and you can skip songs it is basically like your ipod but you don't have to pay for the songs"
45874,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"its the best music app ever.   don't waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app.  its free also instead of paying"
45878,"Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"Oh so sleazy.   Where should I start. 1. The app only works 45%ofthe time - it force closes or drops a song. 2. They put banners over all the buttons so you cant like skip pause etc. Oh and get this; the close button on the ad doesn't work just sends you right to the advertiser's site. Bravo, Pandora."
45879,"Pandora",2013-05-22,5,"awsome   u can make ur own stations (i mean like type like an artist and u get a station about them) u can like songs  plus u can skip a song u dont want to here. i love it i already have 84 stationsits pretty cool"
45880,"Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Forget broadcast radio   Pick a fav artist or song and build your stations.  Very few commercials on free version. Been using for years...no complaints. Almost as good as XM .Add some adult talk stations, like Opie & Anthony. Then 4 stars gets 5 stars."
45882,"Pandora",2014-05-20,5,"The best   My Wife and I have so enjoyed using Pandora over many years and I can say not once has it not been there for us.Thank youRic"

45894,"Pandora",2017-10-24,2,"Two Stars   Too many commercials!"
45895,"Pandora",2011-12-25,4,"Pandora's view   Pandora has been a companion for over nine months now, and I love it! It gives variety, and spice to life, from something to listen to while getting ready for work in the morning or working out in the gym. The latest to oldest music you can get your hands on. Thank you Pandora."
45898,"Pandora",2013-02-12,3,"for kindle   This version of Pandora is really different. The music stops playing after two songs because it wants to see if I'm still listening; and my favorite stations are hard to get to now. They should have left it the way it was."
45902,"Pandora",2017-09-11,5,"Five Stars   Great product listen daily."
45908,"Pandora",2013-06-24,5,"There's nothing like Pandora   I throughly enjoy being able to listen to the different genre of music, my favorite genre is Gospel, I can listen to the old music as well as the new music by various artists.  Pandora, Gotta have it!"
45910,"Pandora",2013-05-26,2,"Used to be the best.   Now that you only have a forty hour time limit is aggravating. If you want to listen to more you have to pay. This used to be all free unless you wanted to remove apps. Not happy Pandora not happy at all."
45912,"Pandora",2013-04-08,4,"awsomely cool   Pandora is awesome I love it I think every body should have Pandora. it is great this app gives you free songs you don't need to pay for anything and you can listen to whatever kind of music you like tots adore!"

45947,"Pandora",2015-02-11,4,"Online Radio   I like that you can listen to your type of music while reading an e-book, email, Facebook, etc."
45948,"Pandora",2014-03-04,4,"Works great.   Taps right into your Pandora account. Works great. The only thing is if your Fire times out, there's a several step process to get Pandora turned OFF."
45950,"Pandora",2016-02-02,5,"Five Stars   great music"
45952,"Pandora",2012-07-26,1,"what happened?   Not sure which update screwed this up but nothing plays when i use the app. A few seconds of buffering and it moves on to the next song, buffers then next song. Ads take up at least 50% of my nexus s 4g screen."
45958,"Pandora",2012-02-27,2,"What a Shame   I used to enjoy this app because it gave me a variety of music from the designated artist, genre, or composer. Soon, it started playing music that wasn't even related to the station. It is quite disappointing on Pandora's account."
45963,"Pandora",2017-11-09,1,"One Star   cant get it to work"
45964,"Pandora",2012-06-19,5,"Perfect   pandora keeps playing music until you pause it or shut the kindle down. perfect for all music needs. because of the feature that makes keep playing you can turn it the screen off to save power. also works while playing games. great application."

45977,"Pandora",2012-11-12,5,"Pandora   I love to listen to music because it motivation and it also make my day flow better. I also like to hear my favorite songs while I'm working out. Sometimes I think when I listen to music it changes my energy in a good way."
45978,"Pandora",2013-08-09,5,"Creating my own radio station!   Now I can listen to music without interruption and select my own genre of music, artists, etc.  It's best than downloading itunes into my iPhone and then having to use up my battery"
45984,"Pandora",2014-11-22,5,"love it   Pandora is a great way to not have to keep having to find a diffrent song when each one is over."
45988,"Pandora",2012-09-22,5,"Pandora   This app is great for anyone that loves music. You get to listen to your own music and music like it. It is great for older music like Led Zeppelin or AC DC and it is great for music now a days like Marty Perry and One Direction"

45995,"Pandora",2013-09-04,1,"not what i am looking for   I want to pick the online radio stations I listen to, not the genre. The app that has the valentines day symbol as part of it's name gives me what I want so this app ia gone."
46001,"Pandora",2013-08-15,5,"Love it!!   I love Pandora!!! One of the few apps that they have left as originally set up. It does EXACTLY what the description says and works as designed.Love it! Love it! Love it!"

Loads Quickly and you get to make your own stations, rate songs, jump to next song if you don't like listening to one.  It doesn't cut in and out like regular radio.  Great for road trips."

46010,"Pandora",2012-11-20,5,"Get the app  :)   Its a radio what more do these people want.  Its got a lot more features than the radio in your car.  It barely ever plays a commercial.  So I don't see why everyone is Downing padora when its a really good app.  :)"
46013,"Pandora",2013-05-20,4,"keeps telling me im at my monthly limit but im not   -after having this app for five months its starts telling you ur at your monthly limit of 40 hours. I timed it this month and I listened for 10 hours and now it wont let me listen anymore!"
46014,"Pandora",2016-04-30,4,"So many ads   If it had less ads that would be nice, it feels like every 2-3 songs there is an ad 😐 I would give it 5 stars if it had less ads but I personally think they give us to many. I know it is free but still"
46019,"Pandora",2012-08-19,4,"awesome app but just one thing   this is one of my best and favorite apps ive had so far on my kindle fire; but there's one thing why I didn't rate five stars so many adds after 3 to 5 songs sometimes less just cut out on the adds!!!!  but over a good app!!!!"
46022,"Pandora",2012-08-08,5,"single artist   to those complaining about it not playing enough of the artist you make the channel for, the riaa regulates them and only allow them to play a single artist 6 times with in a 3 hour period on a given ""channel""per user"
46024,"Pandora",2013-09-16,1,"sucks   this app froze and never came back I had to reset my kindle and lost everything that I put on my kindle"
46027,"Pandora",2012-09-25,5,"Easy listening   Very easy to use, love the organization. Very easy and quick app. Its is very easy to transfer all the information from your kinddle to your comp, although the interface is easy to use, i feel the look should be updated."
46033,"Pandora",2013-06-16,5,"super awesome  radio   Pandora's music is so awesome. I Liston ti it all day long I bet you Pandora is better than youtube plz don.t say bad thing about Pandora it might be better than you TTYL bye!! @_@"
46034,"Pandora",2012-10-06,5,"Love it!   I love this app, its great and since I love pandora this app makes listening to Pandora super easy on mobile devices! nothing wrong with it. I'd love it if I could skip more than like 5 or 6 songs every hour though :P"
46035,"Pandora",2015-10-10,5,"pandora   http://www.pandora.com/"
46036,"Pandora",2016-05-20,3,"3 out of 5   Awesome app BUT it's a battery hog! U can literally watch ur batt going"
46038,"Pandora",2011-11-17,1,"It's not as customizable as one might think...   For something that touts itself as internet radio, it's customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you've likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, look elsewhere. This isn't going to give you many real options for customizing your personal ""station"".Signed, Pamela T."
46039,"Pandora",2012-10-06,4,"Wonderful service.   We've grown to love Pandora as our background music for gatherings and parties.  We access it over Roku and our main TV which is central to our house and our lifestyle.  Great service with great music for all tastes."
46040,"Pandora",2012-03-19,5,"great as always   this app is amazing, if you complain about ads, get over it and pay. they have to make money some way if no one buys it. imagine if you didn't get paid at your job. this app is the best music app out there and either learn to love it or gtfo."
46044,"Pandora",2015-07-18,5,"great app   Very good app I like the music very much"
46047,"Pandora",2012-06-17,3,"its ok i guess   there's to many commercails! there the same ones too. you cant look up a song because when you do you have to listen to a random playlist. if you look up feel so close by Calvin Harris you get skrillex and all these random song's!"
46048,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"problems with ads   i usually dont mind ads, but everytime an ad starts to play it freezes and my music stops playing and the only way i know how to fix it is by force stopping my pandora with the system settings. please help!"
46057,"Pandora",2011-12-03,4,"great app   This app works great, but however you should be aware that this app will use a lot of data while playing I use my home wifi, and or find a free wifi spot while I'm out so I don't burn through all my allotted data. I wish the widget was a little better."
46060,"Pandora",2012-02-25,4,"works good for me!   Downloaded this morning on my Fire. No buttering issues, and very few commercials. Very good for a free app, the only reason i would upgrade is to be able to skip more times per hour. All in all, it made my long day of overtime very pleasant!"
46062,"Pandora",2014-01-07,5,"love it   No tv in my workout room so I turn on Pandora.  It is great.  Listen to music as I walk ""exercise"".  Makes it easier to do my workout."

46097,"Pandora",2014-03-25,5,"I love pandora...   even though I am not paying the $3.99 the commercials are few in between!very seldom do I have connection problems...."
46099,"Pandora",2016-03-20,3,"like, and   Once you create stations, like, and, dislike songs, it repeats the same song entirely to often. I think this will be my last year paying for commercial free. I think I'm going to try Amazon next."
46101,"Pandora",2013-11-03,2,"not for children   it is not good for me or my children. I got it for my child and they did not know the first thing on what to do.also I got a ton of spam on my email"
46115,"Pandora",2014-01-21,5,"Anna~G35   Love all the underground tunes and there's a great variety of genres as well. The absence of advertising is my most favorite feature."
46116,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"Hear you pre-set artists in Pandora   I love the software.  I have it loaded on my tablet, my Computer, my Laptop, My phone, My Blu-Ray player (Bedroom), My Smart TV (Living Room).  I can set it for the one artist, or use the shuffle mode to play all of my favorite artists.The only draw back is that the interfaces are very different on every device."

I used to not have it acting weird, but now, when I quit and come back in, it looks as though it was up the whole time.Worse, though, is how it can be playing, but when I open it to check song title or something, I have to joggle it on the screen side to side in order for the correct title and artist to be displayed, instead of a prior one."

47006,"Pandora",2015-01-09,5,"Once you go Pandora, no other apps will get to store ya (identity). (corny I know, but I'm tired and its catchy)   Great app especially if you pay the extra 5 bucks a month for the plus edition. I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?"
47008,"Pandora",2012-05-10,5,"PANDORA!!!   I like this app because it is like a radio channal but if u don't like the song u can change it with a push of a button."

47015,"Pandora",2012-02-18,3,"good app   well, its amazing but sometimes it doesn't give u the exact singer u wanna listen to and it goes to commercials every four songs"
47018,"Pandora",2012-01-14,1,"cant create playlists?   you cant create new playlists on this app. you can only listen to ones you've already made on the computer website, or the holy ipad.. how has this not been fixed yet? its like these guys have created a camera app where you cant actuatlly TAKE pictures, you can only look at ones you've taken on other devices...."
47021,"Pandora",2011-11-07,3,"double edged sword   pandora speaks for itself in quality and has vast stations. on the flip side it uses a lot of resources and i have to constantly kill it"

I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."

47399,"Pandora",2011-12-01,2,"other radio apps better   Navigation quirky. Ads all-pervasive. Sound quality mediocre. Maybe good if you're already a Pandora fan. Otherwise, skip it. Uninstalling from my Kindle fire."
47401,"Pandora",2012-11-27,1,"too unstable   The ad supported Kindle version just does not work reliably.  Music stops and I hear nothing but am told that an ad is playing.  And music does not return.  Not much good in this form."

47424,"Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"The ony music app you neec   I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."

47447,"Spotify",2015-09-13,5,"Best Music App   This app has the most variety of music available that I have seen in any app and it is so efficient. The playlists you create can be played offline as long as you have a premium plan which, compared to other music apps, are very affordable. I would reccommend Spotify for everyone."
47451,"Spotify",2015-08-31,4,"Best music app I've ever used.   Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads.  My only complaint is that for unknown playlists (such as one I made) is hard for friends of mine to find unless I send them the playlist.  Small complaint, and I definitely love using Spotify."
47452,"Spotify",2016-06-05,5,"simple   Simple and it works."
47455,"Spotify",2014-11-27,4,"Almost Awsome   I love the fact that this is free and our favorite music I shared spotify with all of my friends but here comes the negative thing tablets don't call out of state with a bid ass screen it should be music anywhere for free no internet.

When i go to get the upgrade there is none. So this makes me mad a lil bc ive already deleted my old music app. But other than that its a great app and i love the way you can organize the music!"

There's - browse, many genres to choose from, the radio and the best yet listen to entire albums. It's awesome. Get it. Or at least give it a try. And it's free.

Stop listening to Grooveshark and Pandora and get SPOTIFY! :)"

You can easily search, and find, just about any song or artist that you like, then Spotify finds similar music for you.  Also has a ton of browser options. I like to pick my music by what mood I'm in."
47504,"Spotify",2016-05-26,5,"The best music app   Way better than Pandora. Offers a lot even without premium. You have way more options with tablets or laptops. It's like having premium but free. Not the same story on a phone though. I highly recommend this app"
47513,"Spotify",2017-06-22,5,"It's Great   I am excited to have Spotify and to be able to choose whatever music I am in the mood for!  Thank you."
47520,"Spotify",2015-08-01,3,"great app for the most part   I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99¢ for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I'm in the car for example it says no internet connection and won't let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing."
47525,"Spotify",2014-08-07,3,"While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical ...   While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical commercials for contemporary music.  Music sets a mood.  The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music.  These interruptions are truly ill conceived.  I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met."
47527,"Spotify",2016-01-15,5,"excellent   For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I didn't want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. It's worth it"

47529,"Spotify",2015-10-06,5,"Spotify is amazing   Yes you can only use shuffle play on a mobile device if you're on the free version that's why I'm always listen to the radio but if you like or don't you have to try it on the computer it's totally different.I believe Spotify completely earned five stars"
47534,"Spotify",2017-05-21,4,"Suggestions for playlists   When you do suggestions for a playlist with multiple genres you focus on one genre. Try and suggest songs for all the genres on the playlist :)"

47553,"Spotify",2015-08-13,5,"Great app for streaming your music...   Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a $9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind. This replaces all my long lost CD's and for a fraction of the price of buying songs individually. Five stars for the service and the app itself."

47588,"Spotify",2014-11-08,5,"Love Spotify but...   Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring."

I tried the free version; I didn't love the commercial, especially while I was at work (they were condom commercials) Awkward!!! :)  So I signed up for the premium version and I tell everyone about it."
47611,"Spotify",2015-02-14,5,"Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other ...   I listen in the morning and afternoon at work. Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other like services. You can skip as often as you like and don't need to give a song a thumbs up or down.

47626,"Spotify",2015-11-29,5,"Amazing   Spotify is my absolute favourite app, it is just perfect. I believe that there may be a little bit too many commercials but it makes up for it in letting  everyone free music to listen to. Overall an amazing app, would recommend it to anyone."

You can listen to entire albums for diverse artists, genres, eras, and take a trip down memory lane, or get caught up on some new artists. Or you can create your own playlists with whatever theme you choose. Unlike other apps, you can choose what artists, and what songs, you want on your lists."
47653,"Spotify",2015-06-27,3,"Good but..   I really love this app. It's so easy to find the songs that you want. One thing I dislike is that you need internet to listen to the music. Some of us want to listen without wi-fi but Spotify doesn't let you. I wouldn't recommend if you are going on a camping trip or something."

47669,"Spotify",2016-06-29,3,"not eligible to purchase this app due to geographical restrictions   Latest update is no longer available in Malaysia. Spotify is available in Malaysia, I have a premium subscription with them through my telco, and I can get the latest versions on my other Android and iOS tablets. However on my Blackberry Passport and LeapFrog Epic who can only get apps from the Amazon AppStore, Amazon is denying me the ability to download the update. Very disappointed. I've already contacted Amazon Customer Service and they told me to contact Spotify, who is appearing to be clueless as to what has happened.I'd have given it 5 stars, but denying me off the update, even for something I'm paying monthly for, is just plain wrong."
47677,"Spotify",2016-11-07,5,"OMG   This is the best! I love it. It works great on everything I have. I use it on a kindle fire, iPhone, iPad, amazon echo, amazon dot, and iPod! It is amazing"

47876,"Spotify",2016-01-12,4,"Awesome   Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can't play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it's the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc."
47877,"Spotify",2015-12-12,4,"Best Music App   Spotify is great for listening to your favorite music and discovering new music. Making your own playlists is a snap, and the radio option is pretty snazzy too. I love Spotify more than any other music app I've tried."

Yes. Do I really care that much? No. My husband has the premium version and it's worth it to be able to take your playlists on the road with you. I'll probably upgrade soon."

The only thing I have a concern about since this was available on my new Kindel Fire HD, is the service going to continue to be free, or will I have to begin to pay for the App."
47905,"Spotify",2015-10-29,5,"Impressive selection!   All my favorite classic Brazilian bossa nova and jazz are there. The groups and sub-groups are very helpful. Amazing selection and the audio is really good if you use quality headphones. (I am using this app on a Kindle Fire)."

47971,"Spotify",2014-10-20,4,"Better Than Pandora!   Love it less commercial ads! You get to listen to a lot of music before and ad comes on. The app also let's you try your music without commercials and offline for a free trial. I'm not sure if you have to pay for that feature after the trial period. Still trying to find that out. Otherwise a fantastic app."

47990,"Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"Best music app ever!   All of the other music apps I've downloaded have been slow , don't have all the music I want , or are hard to use. Not Spotify!!!!!"

47997,"Spotify",2017-03-17,5,"I love it.   Spotify gives a lot more freedom to you than Pandora in my opinion.And the Daily Mixes are the best."
48002,"Spotify",2017-02-07,5,"Good way to discover new music   This is one of the two music app that use now (the other one is songza) and then. Though I use the other one more often."

48011,"Spotify",2017-09-27,3,"Three Stars   I had Spotify for a while but I decided to cancel cause it’s a little pricey."
48012,"Spotify",2015-01-11,2,"I did enjoy the music collections once I found them   Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me."
48014,"Spotify",2014-11-21,5,"The best streaming audio app.   I have been a premium  member for more than a year now. I have three sons with smartphones and they all have this app. Since a year ago I don't buy  a CD or buy online music. My sons have there on Playlist and is sync in to there smartphone. They can listen there on Playlist offline and I save money."
48016,"Spotify",2016-02-24,5,"The best ever!   Spotify is hands down the best music app I have downloaded. It has all my favorite music that I love to listen to on a daily basis. Being able to listen off line anywhere is the best feature"
48018,"Spotify",2016-04-02,5,"An excellent addition to Pandora and YouTube   You can easily find and listen to any and all songs from your favorite artists, even the obscure ones, at ANY time."
48019,"Spotify",2015-10-09,2,"Update ruined it!!!   This app started out great. I used it all the time but ever since I updated it they require you to upgrade to premium just so you can turn off shuffle mode and I think that is absolutely ridicules. Do not download this app."
48022,"Spotify",2016-09-09,4,"Worth all efforts   Relatively easy to figure out as far as utilization.  Still experimenting with the ""correct"" approach,but worth hanging in to discover."
48023,"Spotify",2015-03-28,3,"great free music   Great selection of music. Hate that it's shuffle play only and that random songs play based on your other selections. I wish premium was cheaper so I could play anything I wanted. I really like that there's a vast selection of kid songs for my 2 and 6 yr old children."
48025,"Spotify",2016-01-27,5,"one of the best music apps out there   Sporting is a great way to find new music. Even the ads are not that intrusive and are a small price to pay for a great service. I would absolutely recommend this app to any music lover out there."
48027,"Spotify",2017-03-26,5,"Ok   Good??? Idk"
48029,"Spotify",2016-02-08,5,"easy!   I have no issues with this app. It's easy to navigate, saves my recently played songs and playlists, runs in the background as I work on other things. I like it better than the desktop version."
48032,"Spotify",2014-10-06,3,"its okay   I think that it is very annoying that I have the free mode so I can't listen to any song I want I have to listen to all of the other songs and wait till I get to the song I want and also you ONLY get 6 skips so you can ONLY skip 6 times then u have to wait an hourother than that is a good app"
48040,"Spotify",2017-02-25,5,"Awesome   This is where I get my music of course! But the premium is fairly cheap so I can listen anywhere for close to nothing!"
48044,"Spotify",2016-03-02,5,"Good way to expand your music taste   Every time I listion to a radio station it shows me songs that arnt exactly what I was aiming for but hell their pretty cool songs it's like &#34;might like this&#34; an hell I do"

48053,"Spotify",2015-06-08,5,"easy to use   Really appreciate being able to download music instead of only streaming since I have a limited data plan. This is a functional music app. Everything works well. So many choices in music, easy to use, downloads fast. Am really enjoying using Spotify."
48056,"Spotify",2016-11-02,4,"Easy access.   I love Spotify because I can easily access songs that my family loves to listen to, whether, its old or new songs. Creating my own playlist is another aspect I really enjoy."

48070,"Spotify",2017-04-02,4,"Great music app   Great to use, make a playlist of all of your favorite songs!"
48077,"Spotify",2015-06-18,5,"Awesome for Music   Spotify is great for music- it's like a mix of Pandora and Soundcloud. You can both listen to individual songs (and even put them in playlists) but also listen to specific ""stations"" for songs, like on Pandora. Overall, freakin awesome."
48082,"Spotify",2017-09-22,5,"I have wanted this since 1997   How did I ever live without this?"
48083,"Spotify",2016-08-30,4,"Wonderful Selection   Superb selection of music.  Promises thirty minutes of add free listening; they never give you the full thirty minutes. I still love this app."
48084,"Spotify",2017-05-14,5,"I LOVE SPOTIFY!   I've been using it for years and it's amazing!"

48091,"Spotify",2016-01-17,5,"Great Music App   It is not like Pandora. You can actually pick the music you want to listen to yourself, and without having to pay for each song. Best free way to listen to music. I am very pleased with this app."

48096,"Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"SPOTIFY IS...   The BEST music app. The only issue for me is that I am cheap and don't want to pay for prime and thus off line use."
48101,"Spotify",2015-03-12,5,"Its pretty good   It's really good it's well....... I don't know it's just good wait no it's GREAT!"
48102,"Spotify",2015-09-15,5,"Love   I love this App because I love how I can make my n own Playlist and I don't have to deal with random picking by just what b I thumbs up like in Pandora radio. It has pretty much all music and more. Good app worth paying for."
48103,"Spotify",2015-10-26,2,"Something to Fix?   Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to."
48106,"Spotify",2016-10-15,5,"GREAT!!! :)   It's GREAT :) you can listen to all sorts of music I enjoy it and recommend. The only thing is you need premium to listen offline."
48110,"Spotify",2017-07-15,4,"Good   The app is a little laggy and there isn't very much Eminem songs on it but other than that its great"
48112,"Spotify",2017-09-18,5,"Amazing   Best purchase ever!"

48120,"Spotify",2014-08-04,5,"Best music app if you have limited cellular data on your phone   I thought I'd never leave Pandora, but someone made me try Spotify and I haven't looked back since.  You can do a ""radio"" feature, but even better than that is that you can download the songs that you like the most, so you aren't wasting your cell data plan.  Just download the music over Wifi and take it to go!"
48125,"Spotify",2017-06-18,5,"Awesome!!   I love this so much!! Its great and all but it would be better if no WiFi was used..."

48162,"Spotify",2017-01-05,5,"Spotify Premium   Get premium, it's well worth the cost and isyour own personal juke box,and more, if you know what a juke box is."
48169,"Spotify",2015-03-06,5,"spotify is amazing   Spotify is amazing, and I highly recommend the app.  It works best if you have the paid service.  The only drawback is that the mobile version does not allow you to view the words to songs as you listen (you can do that on a regular computer via an in-app program)."
48170,"Spotify",2014-06-16,5,"Love it   I love this app!The only one thing I would change would be not needing internet connection bc riding in the car for long distances is the main time I would love to listen to it but other wise this app is perfect and I would change nothing else! I think everyone should get this app  God bless"
48172,"Spotify",2016-12-25,3,"Okay, getting better.   I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order & retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it's better now than when I first bought it.And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists."
48175,"Spotify",2017-03-30,5,"I love this!   Spotify is a great music app!"
48177,"Spotify",2017-03-09,5,"Fantastic app!   Spotify has a great variety of artists with minimal ad interruptions."
48182,"Spotify",2016-05-02,5,"Excellent!   The app is useful, practical and easy to understand and use, pretty instinctive. I love the feel of its appearance and I like the different playlists available in it."

48184,"Spotify",2017-01-27,5,"Five Stars   Love this app!! All the artists that I'm following automatically get put into one playlist. Thank you spotify!!"
48189,"Spotify",2016-02-29,4,"but I like it so far   I'm still adapting to Spotify on my Kindle, but I like it so far! I do like the fact that you can listen to your playlist off-line plus, you can connect it to a blue-tooth speaker."
48191,"Spotify",2015-10-21,5,"it's great   I love spotify. It's so much better than Pandora. I like how you have a variety of categories. But one thing I would change would make it unlimited skips. Above all, Spotify is great and I strongly recommend it."
48196,"Spotify",2017-09-13,1,"One Star   Never works for blackberry passport silver edition"
48200,"Spotify",2016-02-10,5,"Excellent   I have been able to find every song I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who is looking for a good music app that you can put the songs you like most on."
48202,"Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"love the free version   I've never paid for spotify so my one and only gripe is that it sucks the life out of my data plan... I'm not sure if paying for it would solve that issue but if $10/month would do it, I'd start tomorrow! As long as you expect ads, this is the best free music server out there."
48204,"Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"pretty good   It is pretty good but there are a few cons one is that you need a premium membership to use it with out Wi-Fi and there's WAY too many ads and one more is that you need too search for a lot of the music and you can't change your username. Please look at this before you get it."
48211,"Spotify",2014-10-27,5,"Five Stars   Rather enjoyable. ...definitely recommend☆"
48213,"Spotify",2016-03-22,5,"I like this because when I want to listen to one ...   I like this because when I want to listen to one artist in particular, that is all the music I get from that one artist. Will never go back to other music listening choices."
48214,"Spotify",2016-04-27,5,"Awesome!   The best app ever for real, I've found songs I haven't heard in years plus all the newest stuff you could want! Its also a great way to share playlists with friends."
48219,"Spotify",2016-02-10,5,"Love It!!!   I absolutely love this app. I use this so much more than Pandora. In fact, I don't even remember the last time I opened Pandora. It's the best music app I've invested in, hands down."
48221,"Spotify",2017-04-03,5,"Great on all levels   Wish it didn't need WiFi most the time but everything is amazing and works well."
48226,"Spotify",2015-04-16,4,"GREAT but...   I LOVE this app to pieces but there is one problem. There's no premium on the app store like it said I even checked goggle play store! Why I want premium is because you can go offline and listen to music. I don't care about adds I want to listen music!"
48227,"Spotify",2015-05-26,5,"Awesome app...   I love that I can create multiple playlists of music based upon tempo or theme.  It's like have access to multiple CDs.  Great app.  Just wish I could afford a premium subscription to get rid of ads.  So far I like this much more than Pandora."
48230,"Spotify",2016-07-11,5,"BEST MUSIC APP EVER   I love this app its really cool and my favorite song is IM A PRETTY GIRL by pewdiepie. And its a really cool way to not bored when going campingXD"

48233,"Spotify",2015-01-19,5,"Wonderful App   Very easy to use and in my opinion better than Pandora if you have particular artists or albums you want to listen to. I use this with the Bluetooth feature on my kindle fire to listen to high quality music on my home stereo. I wish I would have downloaded this sooner."
48235,"Spotify",2017-03-10,5,"Great App   I love this app... Works great a few artist have not gone here but I can find them other ways"
48238,"Spotify",2015-01-13,5,"amazing!   This app is a godsend. I can listen to any song I think of, without having to buy it or wait for it to play on Pandora on some radio. My only concern is how they stay afloat financially, but that's not really my business. Overall, definitely deserving of all five stars!"
48239,"Spotify",2015-12-25,5,"amazing   Brought the premium subscription I couldn't have been happier! I save all my music straight to my Fire Tablet and listen to it all day regardless of where I am, WiFi or no WiFi, it's available"
48240,"Spotify",2016-04-27,3,"Ok   I can't figure out how to go premium, it sucks not app but that and u can't listen to it everywhere unless u got internet or data, but I guess other than its good."
48250,"Spotify",2016-03-06,4,"Best service, but acceptable app.   An excelent service but the app must need improvement (don't have many play options, is hard to find the playlists, the options buttons are too small, and a few more things)."
48258,"Spotify",2016-10-31,5,"I turned 91 on October 30,  so I am old enough to know what is good.   I am enjoying the music very much, being a college grad in Music Ed., I have always loved music. This is great for me."

It is easy to find new music, browse old music, compile playlists, and listen to other people's playlists with it. I am so happy with the quality and speed. No complaints except for the infrequent and short commercials, no bother though."
48262,"Spotify",2017-10-12,4,"Great app   Great way to get all the music you want"
48271,"Spotify",2016-07-31,2,"Just ok   It doesn't have a lot of stations and some of the music I wanted. Happy it's free but wouldn't want to pay for it. It also has Comercials ."

48286,"Spotify",2017-02-09,4,"Impressive set up!   I don't want to pay for music, and this is an option.  It does have an annoying amount of advertisements."

48344,"Spotify",2016-01-30,2,"great service, but terrible software   Love the spotify service and selection, but the app is probably the only one that consistently crashes on my mobile and desktop platforms. Recommend changing your developer team!"

But otherwise it has good quality, but it may not give you all the recent songs."
48363,"Spotify",2015-10-12,5,"the best   This is great for long car rides or when your on an air plane. Its awesome for music for parties or just listening to music in general. It has so many viriaties of music. Keep up the good work 😸😁😁😁😁"
48364,"Spotify",2015-11-14,4,"Great Music App!   It's a great app with a lot of great songs, but my main problem is when it says “and now the next 30 mins of music are ad-free thanks to the following sponsor&#34;, it never loafs the ad lately."
48365,"Spotify",2016-05-09,4,"needs an update   The app would get 5 stars if the music was able to be stored on the SD card on my kindle. Instead the music takes up precious room on the main hard drive."
48368,"Spotify",2015-04-02,3,"frustrated   Is it just me or has anyone else notice that the ads are getting worse? Because ever since i updated it I get 3 to 4 ads in a row and if i leave the app instead of watching the video my spotify app gets all froze and i can't do crap to unfreeze it"

If you have Spotify Premium, Dragon can also learn your Spotify playlists and starred items.  That's what got me try Spotify and to eventually upgrade to Spotify Premium.I have become a big fan of Spotify Premium.

48917,"Spotify",2016-08-29,2,"Disappointing functionality, terrible stock playlists/stations.   Was pretty excited to finally nut up for a paid music service after using standard Pandora free since it came out almost 10 years ago.  I was attracted to Spotify for the offline playback, since I lIke listening to music while camping and traveling in the backcountry miles away from cell service.  I started downloading all my favorite music, making playlists, and using the app right away.  I was never in love with the radio, and browse functions, as they felt clunky and not very intuitive. But i was making my own playlists so that didnt bothet me too much.  All was working well until it wasn't.  First the radio and browse functions started working even more poorly and then not at all, then Spotify would freeze up, and I'd have to close the app occasionally and restary.  Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone.  It still works fairly well when its actually working, but it freezes too often. The soft buttons to navigate through the features are too close and mistakes can be made too easily for efficient ""party dj"" type playback.  The stock radio stations have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on making your own playlists, and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundreds of songs ""saved"" to my phone which may be causing the freezing, still unaccpetable. But that is only half of my gripe.  Navigation is awkward and the app is in need of remodel.  I think they employ millenials to put together playlists, I haven't found a decent one yet. I was truly excited for this app but sadly I most likely will cancel if things aren't improved."
48920,"Spotify",2015-09-22,5,"great app   this is a great app for music you just have to make sure that the artist is with them. one thing for them to work on though is for users to able to pick a song and play it whenever."

My husband and sons can listen to their music too even when we're all on Spotify and in different locations.  There have only been a few times in the past couple of years when I couldn't find a particular song, but the iTunes didn't have it either.  I can listen to Spotify in the car, then come in the house and the same song is playing on my computer.  If I want I can turn on my home stereo system and listen to my music throughout the house!  I love Spotify and have been a fan for three years.  I have a premium membership so pay $9.99 per month.  With iTunes, I'd only be able to purchase one or two full albums per month!  With Spotify my downloads are limitless!"

51763,"Spotify",2016-03-25,5,"Totally Awesome!   I don't do reviews often, but I have to speak up for Spotify.  If you love music, (like I do) you have to get spotify.  I have NEVER paid for the  upgrade or Premium Service of ANY APP before until now.  I was lucky enough to get in on a 90 day free trial for Spotify over the holidays and like WOW!!  In a few days, my free trial will end and I fully intend to subscribe to the paid Premium Service, not just for me, but my whole family.  The free version needs to offer a little more freedom so people can really see how fantastic Spotify really is.  If you do a free trial, anything less than a Premium subscription is just a tease and actually depressing."

I'm NOT the one to be rating this app.  I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes.  In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded.So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow.  MUSE.  The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs.  The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies)  So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group.  hahaha.  Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues.  And sounded pretty good with earphones on.  So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

53274,"Spotify",2015-08-25,5,"Which sucks but oh well   Streaming music is so fast on Spotify. Beats Google music or any of them. It downloads on kindles, androids, iPhones, and other devices. Except Xbox. Which sucks but oh well. I love this app. You pay 9 dollars a month but it's sonworth it. All new music is right on there and you can make playlist. As many as you want. It's so amazing. I love Spotify. And the streaming is great."

53303,"Spotify",2014-11-11,5,"Amazing App   I would happily say that this app is EXTRAORDINARY it has everything u want and need in musicPros:All the music you LOVEEvery single artist ever known (even if they aren't good)Make your own playlistsListen to whatever you wantIt awesomeKeeps u updated on the new songsCons:You need premium to listen instead of shuffle playExplicit content (for all u kids out there....what would your parents think)I recommend this app for everyone they has a kindle and you should download it NO CHARGE!!!"
53304,"Spotify",2014-08-14,4,"The sound quality is great (not excellent   I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."
53307,"Spotify",2014-12-22,4,"only android device   I really am enjoying Spotify. At first I found it complicated but after awhile I started making playlists and I haven't stopped yet."

53360,"Spotify",2014-09-15,5,"Spotify Is Great!   Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go.  I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan.  The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library.  It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space.  Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights.  I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions."
53363,"Spotify",2015-09-16,4,"awesome   I love this music app you can listen to music whenever you want😁😁😁😁💖💖💖"

53413,"Spotify",2014-12-23,5,"I think it's GREAT   Just purchased this item and have not had the time to really get to know all the aspects of this purchase.  However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

Could it be that most people take the free version, so there aren't enough Premium contracts to pay the nut? I'm not an audiophile, so $10 is too rich for my blood."

53486,"Spotify",2014-10-29,5,"Best Music App   This app is amazing. I'm disappointed that I used Pandora and SoundCloud when I could've been using Spotify. You can look up any artist, song, or album, and Spotify will probably have it. There's rarely any adds, and you can save whichever music you like to your personal library. The only downfall is that you need wifi to be able to use it, but if you get premium, you can listen to your personal music whenever, wherever. Overall, it's a great app."
53490,"Spotify",2014-11-12,5,"spotify   Spotify is one of the best music apps on the market. Yea premium may cost money by  it's totally worth the $10.00 a month. Get this app!"

53519,"Spotify",2017-01-05,2,"Idiotic ads   Between Pandora and Spotify I prefer Pandora.  Even though Pandora has fewer features it had commercials that are not idiotic.  Spotify on the other hand has commercials done by and aimed at Morons.  Obviously they want you to pay for the service.  Well they are not getting me to pay, as I'll use Pandora."

54350,"Spotify",2016-03-02,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download   I love that amazon has apps to download. The  apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

55867,"Spotify",2014-10-23,5,"this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ...   Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"
55868,"Spotify",2014-11-11,5,"I love it! I can choose my music and play ...   I love it!  I can choose my music and play it for hours.  New music. Oldies.  Awesome app!"

55877,"Spotify",2015-12-07,5,"awesome   Super great"
55878,"Spotify",2014-09-25,5,"Best music app ever.   Spotify is amazing. I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

Here's how I'll put it: Spotify makes me feel rich because l have access to almost all the music that l can ""think of."" And the best part is the cost: which is free. Love it when l (and you) win as we do with this app. I wish most other ""basics"" were just like Spotify! Perhaps a day will come (sooner than later) that disrupt things so that life become an affordable luxury --as Spotify has done for music! Great app!"

56267,"Spotify",2014-12-26,5,"Great source fro music.   Very good source of music. Has an almost unlimited collection to choose from. You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free.  I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available."

56310,"Spotify",2014-08-27,4,"good app   This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I don't pay for it there's ads but when I'm listening to death metal and deathcore, I don't want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

56512,"Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People don't understand this amazing app.   This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)"

I do not yet understand computers well and Spotify regardless, brings mevery good music. Spotify also has shown me how to better understand types of grouping I wouldn't have thought of! I very much appreciate the Premiums option of increased digital audio quality and ability to easily interface with useful software currently, I can and often do listen to Spotify music using Jriver mc 19 either, via headphone or preamplifier, There are many such Software options available as trial for you to learn more about music and computer audio. These points are a very basic starting group for Spotify. If you are as new to computer audio as Iam, enjoy and slowdown. Lee McDonald a.k.a.GREENSIDEUP"

In any case, this application is totally astonishing, waay superior to apple music which is only a more costly duplicate of spotify, spotify is free unless you need premium, however in the event that you don't have premium and you play mudic on rearrange it really gives great suggestions for melodies, for instance in case you're tuning in to lethal by britney lances since you like that tune or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my substance sentiment after, they will reccomend like a tune like dangerous.

57428,"Spotify",2015-10-10,2,"I Thought I could trust You   I've been using spotify for a couple years, for free. Basically as soon as it was out I was using it. Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to( I don't listen to music often) only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says &#34;only with spotify premium can you do this&#34;..... I've never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I'm really upset :( I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I'm not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. :("

57473,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"Not Worth It   I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

I was disappointed because there was not a lot of hip-hop songs that did not have the explicit tag next to it. There was not a clean version or radio edited version for these songs. I was very shocked with the songs I did download whom did not display an explicit tag, but once played there were curse words throughout the song. I was embarrassed & disappointed with using Spotify for the party."

I give it 4.9 stars out of 5 for listening on kindle. And 2/5 stars on android phone. I don't know how it work on apple. But on kindle I love it."

58185,"Spotify",2015-07-22,5,"This is genius!   Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

What I love too, is it helps you find music you like, and it has most every song you can think of. It also has a bunch of different music indie, dubstep, metal, rock, rap, emo, pop, Mozart, alternative (my favorite), and more! In a nutshell, if you like music but don't want to spend your money on discs and other things like that, you'll love this. Best thing is it's free! All you need is an internet.connection."

Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

58706,"Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"Why havent u subscribed to Premium yet! Go do it! 😎   Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

58757,"Spotify",2016-07-23,5,"One word, Awesome!!!   Definitely has become my favorite app. I like all kinds of music, but I would have to say jazz is my favorite genre. I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands  I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

58782,"Spotify",2017-04-01,3,"Amazing app but please fix   Its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped! Please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug"
58785,"Spotify",2016-08-20,5,"Get Premium, its worth it......for some   Spotify has replaced my iTunes.Now, some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless, however, there are benefits to this service.Not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want, you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player. The ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome. If you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it.If you're already purchasing and download more than 10+ songs a month you'll save money with this service."
58786,"Spotify",2016-06-04,5,"Love it!   I honestly love this application so much. In my opinion, it's the best one out there. Although there are a few artists and songs that I can't find on this platform, on the whole it's easy to create playlists, follow your favorite artists, and stream music. Amazing for any music lover."
58787,"Spotify",2015-09-14,3,"Decent, but not perfect.   I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
58794,"Spotify",2015-10-31,2,"Take off the Restrictions on Skips   I used to love Spotify so much. It was basically the best and probably one of the most used music app. Lately I noticed that there have been a lot of updates of the app. Now who wouldn't love New updates to one of their favorite app?Now I can't skip songs more than 5 times in a row, if I want to I have to upgrade to premium. I guess a lot of people aren't upgrading to premium, so now they are making less and less features of the app available for free. Now I don't mind listening to ads, and trust me they do play along of ads back to back after listening to about 5-6 songs."
58799,"Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Stream vs Storage.   I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
58808,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"Change it back!!!   I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only &#34;premium subscribers&#34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! Don't tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."
58811,"Spotify",2015-11-05,2,"log-in problems   Many times I try logging in and out tells me something like ""this email address is already linked to a Spotify account"". Right! Because it's my account,  and I'm logging in, I'm not trying to set up a new account. Otherwise the app works as it should."

Seriously my card was stolen & I don't know the last 4 numbers of the card because I don't know which one was stolen. How do I do that if all my cards were stolen? Does this make sense to you? It doesn't make any sense to me? Explain sensai"
58817,"Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!!   This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
58822,"Spotify",2017-04-18,5,"Everything is great..... It's just the ads   The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The adsI just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky)The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)-That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic"
58823,"Spotify",2015-10-19,3,"Uh...   This app was great, we all know it.But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"

58845,"Spotify",2016-05-13,4,"Love Spotify   Love Spotify, I pay for the premium sub which lets you save over 3000 tracks for offline play. Commercial radio is dead - Spotify is expanding podcast support making it a great audio choice whatever your preferences."
58849,"Spotify",2016-01-09,5,"premium is worth the $   We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem!  However, you can't set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid $5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
58852,"Spotify",2017-02-16,5,"LOVE Spotify!   Wonderful app--better than Google Play or Pandora.  It gives me a lot more listening  options.  I can select the artists or songs I want."
58855,"Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well   Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen .  .  . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."

58859,"Spotify",2017-01-18,5,"I love it!   I love streaming music. Every album I've wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I'll have more time for music and cancel it easily when I don't. I try all kinds of music because there's no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.There's no need to store things. It's great for people who don't have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. It's not just for millennials."
58860,"Spotify",2016-12-26,3,"Really???!!!   I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can't get this. I still have it but I'm really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I'll get rid of it and I really don't want to because I like it but if you don't fix it's gonna go :/"
58861,"Spotify",2014-06-23,4,"Eh... but good   Unless you have premium, it kinda sucks because you can't listen to songs on demand; only shuffle. But rather than that, it's a great app! Easy setup,"
58862,"Spotify",2016-01-04,2,"really?   You guys are idiots, why allow this app to be used without premium if youre going to make sure it doesnt work after so long without premium, the heck, I have a 3 playlists and what they cant work without premium? This is frickin stupid."
58863,"Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Spotify is cool   Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I've experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."

58876,"Spotify",2015-09-25,3,"Love spotify, but app needs work   The app regularity &#34;skips&#34;, similar to like what would happen if you bump a CD player.  It doesn't cause the app to lock up or anything, but is annoying none the less.  This happens in offline mode so it isn't caused by an unreliable network connection.  This is on a fire phone."
58878,"Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"I always use this app!   I was looking for good music apps and I don't really like pandora...it doesn't have enough skips and u don't know what song is going to go on.

58888,"Spotify",2016-09-14,3,"Love this app, but,   Love the app and how it works, except for this device sharing, I share my account with my mom, who has her own playlist. When I'd like to listen to one song in my own playlist, and she wants to listen to a song in hers, my tablet will play the same song she's playing on her separate iphone se, and vice versa, I can't listen to anything without it playing on her phone, I don't like it.

One thing is, the songs that have curse words in them say it and they don't block it out, so I wouldn't pick songs that have curse words in it. Good luck!"
58897,"Spotify",2015-11-22,3,"Ughh   This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It doesn't continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it'll play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it's the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it's a necessary evil."
58903,"Spotify",2017-10-02,5,"Has a large variety of songs, and instrumentals.   I can't count how many times I've listened to Hamilton on this, it has a little of everything and has playlists tFor what ever you may be doing, studying d wrong or even Podcats, after you find st a playlist of a track the app automatically plays a song related to the track you just listened to. This helps you discover new songs and artists you might like, they you would have never found othwise."
58908,"Spotify",2016-12-10,5,"Best App I have ever used so far!   I just love the app. I have installed it on my iPad and my BlackBerry as well as on my laptop. It works well on all three. There is always something new to listen to when I am feeling like something different. I have discovered many new artists that otherwise would have remained unknowned to me and bought their songs afterward. Works with or without wifi or internet connection and can be shared. I am really impressed!"

I have a perfect internet connection, and it does the same thing on other Wi-Fi and on mobile networks. It stops randomly saying that there is no internet connection. All the time. I've looked it up, called support, and nothing fixes it. If it gets fixed, I'll give it five stars. A shame, really."

No commercials and no data usage. It's not worth the higher monthly fee to me once the trial expires so at that point I will be cancelling premium and going back to the free version. It doesn't use a ton of data and I can deal with the commercials to have the ability to choose my favorite music!"

58956,"Spotify",2017-04-13,3,"Good, but buggy on Kindle   On any other device, I would probably give this a 5/5, but there are certain bugs on the Kindle that desperately need fixing. For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."

I'll skip a song, and the next song will play but the first song will still be shown in the notification bar. When I click on the song to get to the app, Spotify doesnt respond and I have to close it. It's so frustrating."
58976,"Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect   Way better than Pandora or any other music app I've tried, its also way cheaper than using iTunes since you don't have to pay for the songs you add.

Is the update only being able to shuffle, and not being able to just tap on a song and play it?! If it is, then that's a stupid update. Or, it may be an update for other devices, but not Kindle Fires. I hope you can fix it, but until then I'm not playing it."

Months ago I needed to close my account for $ reasons and had no help from Spotify doing it. The next month, they billed me. I got really mad because I was under the impression I had done all that was needed to close my account. The second time around I found I had to go through 3 steps to close it. They do not tell you this. If I am going to have service with a company I expect it to have customer service. Period."

I was using the ""p"" service and it was ok.  But with Spotify I can make my own lists, as well as listen to radio.  Then I got premium!  Love this! No going back!  I can find 90 to 95% of what I want.  And with the Discover Weekly playlist I get 30 recommendations a week for my highly eclectic tastes.  Loving it!This was not a paid review!"

Commercials need to be more in line with the type of music streaming. There is no way I'm opting for a service that blasts a screaming voice in my ear after listening to a Bach cantata. I like commercial breaks. Spotify seems to believe where commercials are concerned, one size fits all."

I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option.  The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click  on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built.  Enjoy.  Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success."

Granted that with Sprint, depending on your plan, you can get this free for six months. It was okay if you live in NA, SA, and EU. It does not have enought JPop and KPop to have me pay $9.95 a month.

I have suggestion that around certain holidays where spotify can be cheaper and have some months free. For example the the months for 99¢. I believe that this will ensure more customers and keep some coming back."
59738,"Spotify",2015-09-10,1,"used to be good.........   When I first got this app, it was a dream come true, being able to listen to any song whenever I wanted to (if I had WiFi) and the variety of the radio stations. But a few days ago, the app updated and I have no say in what I listen to unless you have premium and I'm forced to shuffle play but after 5 skips you can't skip anymore. Please fix this and convert back the original version of Spotify where you have the freedom to choose what you listen to and whenever you want to listen to it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you choose if you want the app or not."

Sound quality is amazing! My only wish is I can play music without premium, so when I dont have access (wifi is needed if you dont have premium) I just use my mp3 player when I dont have wifi. Otherwise its awesome I have had playlist with over 300 songs so defiantly a lot of song space in a playlist.  You can even watch the late night show with jimmy fallon so win win over all great app defiantly get it if your looking for music. Sorry for rambling on!"

Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame."

Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past.

You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too!  You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups  and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify!  @loviemonsters!"

59944,"Spotify",2016-08-24,5,"Best app available for music lover's   Absolutely one of the best apps I have downloaded. The music selection is immense. I took the free trial and plan to buy the monthly subscription. I am a big music fan. This gives me the ability to experience all genres."
59945,"Spotify",2014-09-11,1,"Oh, so I have to pay to listen to my own music I already own?   BEST SCAM EVER!!!!  At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service.  Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN.  Where to begin...First, disclaimer:  I'm an audiophile.  I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies.  I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake.  So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.1.  Algorithm.  Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably.  All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock.  In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement.2. GUI.  Not horrible, but certainly not the best.  Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready.  Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!!  If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly.  Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.3. Paying to play owned music.  This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person.  While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly?????  Can someone make sense of this to me?  Why are people paying for this, again????  Ridiculous.  Developers:  The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!!  Otherwise, why even have this feature?  Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service.  Let the people play their owned music for free.4. Equalizer.  Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  Look up Poweramp.5. Cost.  So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good.  Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT.  Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price).  If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify."

60034,"Spotify",2015-11-24,5,"Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music   I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love.  It has way more than other subscription services I've tried.  The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another.  I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device.  I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials  Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient.  I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly  works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs?  When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

60046,"Spotify",2016-11-14,5,"Spotify is the go-to music app   Spotify is the best go-to music app available.  I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed.  I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop.  I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data.  There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists,  which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder.  It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"

You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you'll start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time.

60099,"Spotify",2015-10-25,1,"From an extremely angry user   I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads didn't bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just don't want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit isn't an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I'd rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I'm really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you've lost many users to this and you're just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I'll just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. You're Welcome, Spotify"

60109,"Spotify",2015-06-27,5,"The BEST music app ever!   THE best music app of all! I was a subscriber to a monthly music service for years. Then I found out about Spotify. I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials!  You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it."
60115,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass.   I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times.

And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."

I live in Tucson, AZ and have been Care-giving for my 81 y o Father for the past 9 years out of my home.  His health recently hit an all time low placing him into Home Hospice status.  My Sister (49 y o) who lives in Charlotte, NC contacted her two sons (18 & 22 y o - my Fathers Grandsons) requesting they put together a playlist for my Dad including his favorite recording artists including but not limited too Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, & Jethro Tull. They new this was a job to be done best by SPOTIFY.The Playlist was quickly assembled by the Grandsons, they e-mailed me (55 y o) my new created User Name & Password, I followed simple provided download directions.

60124,"Spotify",2017-04-11,5,"Spotify recovered my hacked account and deleted playlists   Well I have both Spotify and Pandora premiums.  Spotify to me is way better though for several reasons.One, Pandora tends to skip alot and then instead of just pausing the song a second or two till it re-connects, it jumps to the next song.  Gets rather annoying.  Spotify on the other hand will pause, and then in a couple of seconds continue on with the same song.Two, I can choose playlists and download them if I know I'm going to be in a place where connection isn't very good.  Pandora is good for suggesting songs based on your likes.  I often use Pandora for that reason alone.  But when it finds songs for me that I like, I add those songs to my Spotify playlists.Third, and for the kicker.  I haven't used Pandora customer service so I can't judge them.  But Spotify customer service is Aces.  I was looking for a phone number to call them - which they don't have I found out, but that's okay.  I used their contact form on their website and they contacted me back the very next day.  The problem I was having was that my account got hacked and PW changed.  Wouldn't have worried about it too much but I had my payment info, and of course playlists that I had taken lots of time to build.  They immediately locked my account to where no one could access it, and deleted any personal & payment info.  Then restored access to me.  Not only that, they recovered all my playlists that had been deleted by this jackass whoever he/she/it may be (psyilucas@gmail.com).Anyway, several emails back n' forth with a badass rep named Christian over at Spotify, and I'm back to fully operational status!"

And there's even a bonus, maybe only for my specific kindle: even though I don't have premium, i'm still allowed to select songs I want to play when I want to play them, instead of just playing shuffle and having no control over what's playing all the time.Occasionally, ads come a few seconds before the song is over, which is a little disrupting, but it's not really a problem.Good work, Spotify, keep it up. :)"

60166,"Spotify",2015-09-07,4,"Best Music App with Minor Issues   This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion.  You can easily access all of your options, and it plays clearly with very few issues.  One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while, you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online.  I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track.  Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time, you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play.  I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song.  Other than that, I really like the app, and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps (Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc.) out there."

60170,"Spotify",2016-01-20,5,"Better than Pandora for sure   I love my spotify.  I have the free version.  I use it primarily when I'm working on my computer for music background or working out or working.  When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music, you don't have to worry about turning the channel, or hoping the next song is better.  They are all great songs, because it's your selection.  You can make different lists too, which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it."

Allowing you a full musical experience in a very cost effective manner. Music is the background of life keeping us present. Let me tell you a quick story. When in my car with a nephew one afternoon I realized my music collection was so stale and outdated. An indicator part of me was stuck in the past and holding on to something. Like many of us, I had spent a lot of money on everything from albums, 8 track, cassetts and CD over the years. At some point that investment switched from buying to storing music. The cost of holding on to the past prevented me from experience the present. And takes me back to the beginning of my story. So my solution to keeping life's background revelation in a cost effective manner is SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allows me to stream Spotify thought out the home"

You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created, or make your own.  The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it's own suggestions, and there are several add-ons (last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc.) that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what's new and popular.  The social element is also fun. You can follow other users (including artists) and see what they're listening to, and share songs and playlists.  I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!"

60180,"Spotify",2014-12-28,5,"spotify new user   Well for the longest I would use this app in the free version. On PC its the best program for me even in free version because you create unlimited playlists and skip as many times as you want only there was commercials. I recently upgraded to premium and it's 100x better. No more commercials and some features I don't use. I forgot to mention spotify on mobile only allows several skips a day. With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose. I personally liked the free version over Pandora for the simple fact that I could make a playlist on Spotify and play it on my phone but would be on random or &#34;shuffle&#34;. And now I just like the fact that I can now fully listen to my music and not be annoyed with  commercials or no more skips allowed."

I like to chose what I'm listening to, and sometimes even want to hear a specific song... imagine that.  Spotify does that, and also has a huge number of 'radio' and playlists available if you don't feel like choosing everything."

60247,"Spotify",2015-11-30,5,"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!   The very best music appI've ever used! Remember when you listened to exactly what you wanted? I love searching for the perfect song, or that album I haven't heard since I was a teenager. Then there are the times I just select one of countless compilations/artist/playlist and enjoy. The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"
60254,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best app for music playing especially with student discount.   Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me."

Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"

Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."

For 10 dollars a month you never need to buy another song again.That being said, I was heartbroken because I could not find my favorite song of all time: ""Starlight"" by Don Diablo and Matt Nash. This crushed me enough to give it a four star review. If you're into ultra-obscure music like me, this might not be the app for you. Give it a try, though. It's free!"

And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music. I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!"

He also has a kindle fire HD, and we played no money for his. It's a fantastic app, worth even five dollars, but it's an even better deal because it's completely FREE!!!!!!"

I don't want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I'll enjoy it as is."

However this past spring, I thought hmmmm let's check out Google Play's music app,  and after 2 months returned to Spotify. Your app, and the new lay out and updated features are AWESOME! 🙋 Your team has always been helpful when I had ?'s and promptly with responses. I'll continue to be a long time listener and supporter of Spotify!!! Thank you"
60372,"Spotify",2014-12-28,4,"Great except....   I was a faithful Pandora listener both at home and work then I discovered Spotify. What's not to love? ad free, music available offline and they have every artist I look for. So why only four stars? Spotify has to do what Pandora manages seamlessly-allow me to block explicit content. I cannot stream radio at work for fear of the f-bomb emitting from my speakers. Fix that and you will have hit the sweet spot!"

So glad I downloaded it! Basically it's like Pandora and YouTube rolled into one. You can listen to stations, make your own stations, and my favorite part: you can search a specific song an  listen to it right then. You can also save your favorite songs to a playlist that you can listen to whenever! Another plus is that this app has NEVER crashed or malfunctioned in anyway since I've had it. Absolutely beautiful design as well, I love this app!"

60603,"Spotify",2017-07-02,5,"Easily share and discover new music   The Spotify app is easy to use, even on my Fire tablet!  I like the capability to share playlists, and the radio function makes it easy to discover new music."

60613,"Spotify",2017-09-29,5,"Unlimited access to every genre of music!!   I've had spotify for a while now and the amount of music available in every genre you're into is endless. I just wish they had this 30 years ago!!!"
60638,"Spotify",2017-01-22,5,"Great!!   This app is great with bunches and bunches of playlists picked by Spotify and some from other people, tons of artists, and not just the ones that are popular right nowor even in this country. Its especially cool because, at least on my version of one of the newer kindles, music from YouTube won't stay playing in another tab or when in an app, but Spotify will."
60642,"Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"Awesome !!   I can't say enough about it. It works, has what I like and is easy to use. The commercials every 30 minutes are not a problem at all. If you listen to radio, you get commercials. If you listen on Spotify, you get to choose what songs or artists you want to hear."
60649,"Spotify",2017-06-26,5,"I love spotify and I'm a premium user   I love spotify and I'm a premium user. Love their radio and their folders option! Good app all around. I like their music discovery options also"
60651,"Spotify",2015-09-12,2,"The new update is awful!!   I use to use spotify all the time! The newest update makes it non useable! They're forcing me to use shuffle play, putting on songs I've never even heard of, and taking me off of my playlist! And it keeps shoving the premium upgrade in my face! I sincerely hope that spotify will go back to the way it was."
60661,"Spotify",2017-04-23,5,"Any song youwant   Cannot spend 10 bucks any better"
60669,"Spotify",2015-02-20,3,"Great Music - not so great app performance   The music end of things is excellent - variety, choices, interface.  The system requirements when running on a very new PC is ridiculous.  It uses a large portion of your systems resources, so everything else acts oddly and sluggish.  I like the mobile app, it has it's flakes also.  But overall the Premium version of this app is decent."
60671,"Spotify",2017-05-24,4,"Love it   I like this put the only problem is that when u play the music it go away. Like I am a lazy person I have to go to spotify and put the song again 😧 the music erases every time"

60729,"Spotify",2017-08-09,4,"Pretty Great   Great app.  Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. 😁🎵🎶"
60734,"Spotify",2017-03-14,4,"Best. Music. App. Ever!!!!!!!   Spotify is the bomb for music apps because it is gtreat and has basically every song out there!!  I do wish there was a way to get rid of that thing where like if your listening to music while your in the shower and it says click here for no ads you can't click it and then ypou have ads!!!!"
60738,"Spotify",2017-08-21,4,"Great music service   One of the few services that plays the whole album.  Strong signal and few commercials."
60739,"Spotify",2014-08-27,3,"Good - Could Be Great with a Little Work   Spotify is the music player of choice for my entire family. Tap into a vast amount of music with this app. We love for the Spotify platform.However:This app really needs to be revisited as tablets, phones, and non-traditional operating systems (i.e. Chromebooks and Linux) become more prevalent and users begin to use these devices as their primary access to the internet. There are features that are unavailable with this app which make playlist management cumbersome at best. It seems that if you are going to fully utilize the amazing Spotify service you need to have a Windows (or maybe Apple? - I am not an apple user) machine and a copy of the local software."
60748,"Spotify",2015-07-08,5,"I LOVE IT!!   This app is better than Pandora. For example, you can repeat the song that your listening to, and make play lists. Spotify also has Radios with UNLIMITED skips. You can follow people on Spotify, but there is no messaging other people. So, you can repeat you favorite songs, make play lists, have radios with UNLIMITED skips, and you can follow people but no messages, now that's great deal for free!"
60749,"Spotify",2015-10-02,5,"Fabulous Music   The music I love is not commonly found on radio. So it is so wonderful to find it on Spotify!"
60750,"Spotify",2017-07-18,2,"I enjoy music probably more than any one I know   I enjoy music probably more than any one I know.  My son put me on to Spotify and I thoroughly enjoy it.  Some time ago I thought I had lost it and I just about panicked since I had so much time invested in building up my lists.  Listen to it almost daily."
60759,"Spotify",2017-05-31,5,"Can't do without it.   I listen to it every day. Poor Pandora got left out in the cold. I haven't used the commercial free yet, but plan on it soon."
60763,"Spotify",2017-10-16,5,"Best music app ever!!!!!   This is a very good app because it keeps playing when it's turned off unlike other apps."
60765,"Spotify",2015-12-25,5,"Great Service.   Love this service. Used to have rhapsody. Now they suck. Thank god I found Spotify. Amazon Prime Music is starting to suck a bit too. Spotify all the way! Music, Audiobooks, Language courses, famous speeches, Poetry and more. Seriously? It is totally worth the $10/month."
60773,"Spotify",2017-03-28,4,"Could be 10/10...   Pretty great, would give 5 stars if they had Bob Seger"
60774,"Spotify",2017-08-05,5,"So much great music!!!   I personally never imagined I would stream much music besides the occasional live show.. I've been collecting music in all formats seemingly forever; but now I realize most times I wanna listen to something in my archives it's easiest just to stream it on Spotify!!! This free music app is the best ever, I'm my opinion.. Now if only Drag City Records would allow their artists to stream on this site.."
60776,"Spotify",2017-08-06,5,"I WILL FOREVER USE THIS   it has a search unlike Pandora and there are more options"

60816,"Spotify",2017-01-19,3,"It was great..   It would be nice if it didn't get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there's ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device."

60823,"Spotify",2017-10-01,5,"Love it   I love listening to My Little Pony, Michelle Creber, and High School Musical songs! 5 stars 100%!!!"
60825,"Spotify",2016-08-09,5,"Awesome alternative for Pandora   Awesome alternative for Pandora.  Switched because of some company views with which I didn't agree.  Sorry I haven't switched before. The option to listen to one artist or mix with other artists and create your own ""station"" is way better than Pandora's.  I wont be going back to them."
60828,"Spotify",2016-01-10,5,"LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!   If you love hearing music, this is the PERFECT app for you!!! This app contains any music that you like, you can search it up, press play and done!!! This app is very easy and fun to use, but the only downside is that you have to have a specific age to use it..... other than that, this app is great! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!😁😎💜🎵🎶🎼🎹🎸🎤🎧🎻"

60846,"Spotify",2017-08-04,4,"I enjoy both the search and the playing   Worthwhile to check old and newer albums for songs, add them to your list and play your list thru tablet, etc. I enjoy both the search and the playing. More songs than I have time to find. Good app."
60848,"Spotify",2017-07-20,2,"Two Stars   Another mistake that does not function well on my Kindle Fire."
60853,"Spotify",2016-07-09,5,"Best music streaming service.   By far my favorite music streaming service. Love the 'make available offline' feature that lets you download albums/playlists/etc to listen to on the go without wasting data."

60865,"Spotify",2017-08-04,5,"You will love this app.   I just love this app.  I listen almost every day! Best music app out there."
60873,"Spotify",2016-06-07,4,"On Computer Fabulous, On Smartphone A Little Annoying (if you have the free account)   The only thing that annoys me, and I just don't understand, is why am I permitted, even with a free account, to play whatever specific songs I wish when using Spotify on my computer, yet with my smartphone I'm powerless to do so?Seems rather inconsistent."
60874,"Spotify",2017-07-08,5,"Spotify is my sweet sweet baby   If I had time is he making playlists and listening to music all day. For this reason, I am in love with spotify."

I love that not only can I listen to a full album if I want, but I can make my own playlists. PLUS play a radio station of a certain artist (just like the other radio app that rhymes with Fandora).I pay the monthly fee and it's totally worth it.Would recommend this for anyone!"
60882,"Spotify",2017-07-28,5,"the best music app   Love the app. It's got almost every song you can think of"
60889,"Spotify",2015-09-17,5,"obsessed!!   Absolutely looooooooove this app. I listen to it in the morning, in the car, at work, before I go go bed. And what I love is that I get to create my own playlists. I don't have to worry about skipping songs or totally feeling my playlist and then.....blah! Nope. Never my issue. I even have playlists for my kids (edited versions of radio hits too!). I'm always recommending this app to everyone and have forced a few of my friends to get it!! Love it!"
60890,"Spotify",2016-01-14,4,"Great   Good I like it because it has music any type you want and it still plays when you get out of the app like right now I'm listening to music from it while writing this."
60891,"Spotify",2016-03-23,5,"Better Than Pandora   I had pandora thinking nothing could be better than this and thought maybe I'll give spotify a try. Believe me I was surprised, spotify had music that pandora didn't have yet! Also there were way more features on the free version that Pandora 's paid version didn't even have like how you can play certain songs on genres, the radios obviously has limits but it gives me way more control."
60894,"Spotify",2015-02-03,4,"All I need is music!   I've used Spotify for a long time now (I was a paying member for years), and I love being able to find just about any artist or song I want with no hassles.  Sure, commercials are a drag, but it's not irritating enough to keep me away from this app.  I use this all the time."
60896,"Spotify",2016-11-12,5,"Awesome   I like it because it has many different songs and artists but it also has its perks but it is mostly amazing because when you are on trips its fun to listen to this instead of the radio"
60897,"Spotify",2014-09-29,5,"Best Music App!   Spotify is definitely my new favorite music app. I love how organized it all is and how you are able to create and name your own personal playlists. It is also up to date with some of the newer music, yet still has some of the older, still good music. I love the variety of bands and artists it provides and the organization offered. So if you haven't thought of it yet, Spotify is the app to get for playing music. :)"
60903,"Spotify",2017-08-26,5,"Pandora convert   I am a convert from Pandora.  I listen to new age music to sleep and the constant commercials got to be irritating...and I didn't want to pay extra just for sleep music.  With Spotify and my prime membership I have never had a commercial, listen to the station I like, select tracks I like and download them so I can listen offline in a cabin in the woods or anywhere I want to be lulled back to sleep.  Plus online I hear new stuff on the station I chose to expand my playlist.  Like the fact that it all meshes with my kindle fire so easily."
60904,"Spotify",2017-07-26,5,"WOW!!   A great app that provides everything it promises!!"

Its a great way to have tons of music at your fingertips without having to spend oodles of money.  I use their free subscription, which works for me as the ads are minimal and not very frequent. I highly recommend Spotify over other music streaming apps"
60918,"Spotify",2017-10-13,5,"Literally Rocks   I've been using Spotify for years. Love it! I can create my own playlists, listen to other playlists, find new music, get notified when my favorite artists are playing nearby, and listen to stations created around an artist or genre. It's even linked with Shazam!  Add a subwoofer and speakers...off ya go!"

It's $10 a month and I don't even notice bc it gets taken out of my checking account. No paying $1.29 per song, since you always have unlimited access to millions of songs and albums. I love being able to make fun playlists too! And spotifys playlists they offer are pretty good too, in my opinion."
60939,"Spotify",2017-06-12,5,"Best ever   This is a awesome app.I can play whatever music I want,and still not have to pay anything!only that it gives me adds to go premium to get rid of them.still good though!"

60954,"Spotify",2015-10-25,3,"Pretty Good   The spotify app is great for listening to music. Some of the problems I am having are that when I'm on YouTube, spotify will randomly start playing without the app being open. Also, you only get a limited amount of skips if you don't have premium, and you can't choose which song to play."

61016,"Spotify",2014-10-30,5,"Just as great as the new iPhone version   I love the new interface that Spotify has designed with their mobile apps - mostly very intuitive and genuinely beautiful with their use of album art and photos in the backgrounds. The way the now playing panel appears in the notification pull down is gorgeous and rounds out a great music listening experience on my Kindle. I just wish it were caught up to whatever Amazon's security standards are because the pop up warning prior to opening it every time is a tad bit annoying."

61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I thought it would be...   When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I'm just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".).You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."

With Spotify advertisements are almost non-existent. The only thing that does need to be implemented is a setting to turn off or take out swear words. All in all this app is a very good app and I recommend this app to anyone who wants some music in their day."

61571,"Spotify",2016-04-23,5,"awesome   This app is aamazing! It has pretty much every thing from guns n roses to dropkick Murphys (both of which I recommend). My only complaint is there are these things called premium features and it says upgrade to Spotify premium to use and you can't. But other wise great app 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😃"
61572,"Spotify",2017-05-22,5,"Best app ever!   Spotify has everything!"
61575,"Spotify",2016-03-31,4,"Great!   I love this app! It's runs great, and has all the song I'm looking for. The only severe flaw to this app would be that it needs WiFi for everything! You can't listen to any of the music if you don't have WiFi. Besides that great app!!"

61587,"Spotify",2017-08-09,4,"Favorite Music Streaming and Radio App   I only wish the playlists were more customizable like non-streaming music playing programs. Other than that, it's a fantastic app and I even recommend paying for premium."
61588,"Spotify",2017-10-29,5,"Love Spotify   Great selection, easy to get to it and huge podcast selección."
61593,"Spotify",2016-07-03,5,"Awesome!   A lot of people use Pandora, but I prefer Spotify for its hands-on song choice. it really gives a lot of options for making playlists, from radios which are updated and random to choosing song by song. To whoever created Spotify: thanks and awesome job!"
61600,"Spotify",2017-04-03,5,"Fantastic selection   Nothing comes close to the variety of artists and albums. I've found albums that I lost years ago and new artists thati discovered from my kids. Great app!"

61606,"Spotify",2015-12-07,1,"Sucks   There is multiple reasons it sucks, I've only had it for about 2 minutes before I noticed the &#34;shuffle only&#34; thing. WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?! You click the track thinking your going to listen to it, but the &#34;shuffle&#34; option flashes at you as if saying &#34;you have to shuffle it to listen to music, retard!&#34;. I hope somebody got fired for this. The fact that they think I like one song, so I like every song is just plain stupid. Do the world a favor and release something GOOD, please. Thank you for exciting me for nothing. Eff you, and goodbye."
61609,"Spotify",2017-05-20,5,"good   definitely my favourite music app"
61610,"Spotify",2014-07-03,5,"A music lovers choice   This is a must have app if you love music you have a variety of Playlist choices from pop to children's and subscription is only about $10 bucks not much."

61641,"Spotify",2016-05-14,5,"Five Stars   I like that they play only the songs I have in my playlist"
61644,"Spotify",2015-09-10,1,"Now Officially Ruined and Doesn't Even Deserve One Star!!!   I dont know if it was the update or not but now the only way you can listen to anything on spotify is by clicking shuffle, you cant pick anything anymore. I wished they wouldn't have screwed with anything!"
61653,"Spotify",2015-02-18,3,"A little better than Pandora Plus, but twice the price.   It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over (unlike pandora) but $10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."
61655,"Spotify",2016-03-10,1,"Really?!   Do you seriously have to pay $10 a month just to listen to music?! I mean for premium?! I mean, you could just pay once and not have to pay $10 a month, but that is just impossible!!!!!"
61660,"Spotify",2017-05-21,5,"Just try it!!!!!   Its reputation speaks for itself. Easy to use and customize. Organized in such a way so that you can spend less time researching new music and more time enjoying it. Five stars. Great investment."
61661,"Spotify",2015-09-10,4,"Good but update ruined it.   This app was Good and you could make your own playlist and fast forward when you like. But now with the new update everything is pretty much the same except now your not able to fast forward and for certain songs all there is are covers. Which stinks because if you were able to fast forward unlimitedly I would rate this a 5 and more."
61664,"Spotify",2016-05-05,1,"Another Amazon dud   cannot get into the site.  No matter what I try it wilk not let me log in or create an account. Another failed amazon app"
61669,"Spotify",2017-05-26,4,"Awesome listening Variety   The app has a lot of genres of music to choose from, but sometimes the ads get to be a bit much. Sometimes the ads will break the flow of the app because it got stuck loading but never loads."
61670,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"the new update   This new up date sucks now spotify is like Pandora but you can add all your favorite songs. You have a skip limit unless you pay to be a member, you can't have songs on repeat unless your a member, and you can pick the songs you want to play u must use shuffle unless you are a member. Spotify change back other wise more people might go to Pandora."
61671,"Spotify",2017-08-16,5,"Best app   Awesome love it!!!!!"
61674,"Spotify",2017-07-19,4,"It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if ...   It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I'm not paying money to use an app.  Sorry ain't happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff isn't fee.  It's a good app but it's not the best especially for those folks who don't have spare money to waste."
61680,"Spotify",2017-07-17,5,"Great app   So far I love it!!!"
61685,"Spotify",2017-08-28,5,"Great music app   Worth paying for"

This is is amazing for all types of people.... if your into gospel, pop, r&b, rap, hip pop, country, calm, energetic, techno, etc. whatever genre it is...it's there!! I fall asleep to all of my favorite music, artists, or genres....overall it's amazing!! Also, for premium it's $0.99 for 3 MONTHS!!!!"
61687,"Spotify",2017-03-17,5,"Best music app!   Lovvvvveeee it so much!!!! The best music app ever. It's totally easy to use. It has all the latest songs."
61688,"Spotify",2017-03-26,5,"Five Stars   Ok"
61691,"Spotify",2015-08-19,5,"Awesome   Normally, with this kind of app you can't put custom songs into one playlist like iheartradio or pandora, so since this app allows you to do that along with what iheartradio and pandora (not mentioning a few others), it is definitely the best music app to have."
61697,"Spotify",2016-12-21,4,"Specify Review   I love it and use it every day, but is slightly glitchy and has the tendency to stop playing music and only says, ""Get Premium to play ad-free music."" When this happens, restart device as many times as necessary."
61698,"Spotify",2015-09-13,5,"titenic song ON HERE OMG COULD OF CALLED THIS GAME FLYING EGGPLANT   omg jontron ft shmoyoho titenic is on here amazing along with dagames fnaf songs and living tombstone's songs, perfect app for anyone who likes any one of thoses,AND MUCH MORE,my final thoughts, YOU COULD CALL THIS APP 10/10 AND NOONE WILL ARGUE WITH YOU,cant forget the flying eggplant"

61722,"Spotify",2017-04-06,5,"best music app ever made   Guys and women. This is the best music app that can be made. It has any genre you would want. From R&B to hip-hop, punk  heavy metal, etc. And when I say everything I mean everything"
61724,"Spotify",2015-02-20,5,"What more could I want .....   Spotify is apart of my everyday life. I have tried the others but found that I always come back to where I love.I am a person that loves music , this gives me the chance to hear a song , gives me variety and adds new songs to my playlist . I get to hear what I want to , when I want to, no commercials . It is everything I expect from my mucis and more.. I'm addicted .."

61726,"Spotify",2017-09-07,3,"Good app, but not perfect   Still missing some pretty popular music, gets very glitchy when using with multiple devices.Songs that I downloaded are suddenly not downloaded. My library fluctuates if I'm on wi-fi, songs that I removed keep coming back into my library, not very user friendly."
61728,"Spotify",2017-07-22,5,"Great music app   I really enjoy Spotify. Tons of music, playlists created for you based on your interests, new music suggestions weekly. Two thumbs up!"
61730,"Spotify",2017-08-24,2,"Too many ads, too many lies.   As per music ratio is way too much. It says thirty minutes of free music, but I've timed it several times. If I've ever gotten twenty minutes I'd be surprised."
61731,"Spotify",2014-07-09,4,"Like with one issue   This is a good app.  Spotify is better with a subscription since it allows you to download and listen to it offline.  I was able to cancel sat radio and limit my streaming on my cell with spotify.  I took advantage of the student price for my subscription.  The only issue I have is that I listen to a wide range of music.  One of my favorite genre is kpop.  I am not able to find much to download."

61747,"Spotify",2017-07-26,5,"Gospel songs   Great place to find great songs"
61748,"Spotify",2016-12-31,5,"I recommend the service   Compared to iTunes, where it is at least a dollar per song, I pay 10 bucks a month and have unlimited downloads. For the amount of downloads I have the money is well worth it. I recommend the service!"
61749,"Spotify",2017-01-28,5,"Awesome!   Love it, need to have it."
61750,"Spotify",2016-09-04,5,"Does music things   App is only worth it with premium, if you have free you can only shuffle albums. But 10 dollars a month (5 if you're a student) is worth it for anyone who obsessively listens to music. Has pretty much everything you'd ever want."
61753,"Spotify",2017-06-17,5,"The Pandora killer   Because of Spotify, I will never use Pandora again. Spotify is great, because it allows you to build your own playlist(s) and you're not forced to listen to songs that really don't suit your mood. I have Spotify on all of my devices."

61766,"Spotify",2014-10-15,5,"Plz Get   Plz get this it is great if you love music.

When I first bought the app for free through the advise of my sister, I was thrilled by the number of skips and how many songs you could download. But turns out these are really members for premium members. All of my downloaded songs were deleted and I was not allowed to skip anymore. What I wonder is why can  easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money, but I do not like this feature. Also. they play unrelated songs when your trial is over. You could get all the features you want, but only if you upgrade to premium membership."
