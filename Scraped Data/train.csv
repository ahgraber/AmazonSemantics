2,"Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it's just not worth payhing a year in advance for it.   Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this.  Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks.  Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again.  The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought.  But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."
7,"Amazon",2015-06-17,5,"Amazon does it again!   This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"
10,"Amazon",2016-05-02,5,"Loving the selection so far!   Just started using Amazon music but so far I am really liking it! I was easily able to find music that I liked and out it where I can listen to only what I want to listen to! Lots to choose from and I have barely begun to look! My only issue is that now my son is asking me non-stop for my phone so he can listen too! As long as he stays in my country world, all will be well!"
14,"Amazon",2016-05-14,5,"Stream music   Absolutely love Amazon Prime Music..it's very easy to navigate between different music styles where you can listen or skip and save your preferences with 1 tap. They of course have updates regular to add all the newest songs"
15,"Amazon",2017-06-19,2,"fiddle-y and annoying. Maybe it's better from my Chromebook   Tweaky, kept having to back out of the app to change stations, fiddle-y and annoying.  Maybe it's better from my Chromebook, but on my phone the app was a PITA and I probably won't use it."

23,"Amazon",2016-12-02,5,"BETTER THAN ITUNES!   AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"
25,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Amazon music for Android   I plan to work with it a little more, but so far am not impressed. Too complex. Too many steps involved to listen to music, in spite of the emails telling me was a great offering is available to me as a Prime member. Pandora is much simpler and user friendly."

34,"Amazon",2017-01-15,1,"IF, IF, IF this were accessible by ""dial-in"", it would be GREAT. But it's not. So sorry. I'm not rich enough for data usage.   IF, IF, IF this were accessible by ""dial-in"", it would be GREAT. But it's not. So sorry. WHEN will all the radio and music industry EVER learn that not everybody on planet earth can afford giga bite upon giga bites to download simple music to enjoy. GO GET a life in the real world out here will ya."

47,"Amazon",2017-04-15,2,"Wth   Why is this app not working at all?"
53,"Amazon",2016-03-23,1,"BB no longer supported   I always gave great credit to Amazon for doing its part to make Android apps available for the BlackBerry OS. No longer. I have reason to own a BB10 OS device, which does have the ability to run Android apps, but only if the vendor allows the app to be downloaded, which in this case Amazon no longer allows. I'm dumping my Amazon Prime subscription and giving the money to Spotify."

66,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Best streaming music service I've found   It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."

100,"Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually Works Well   This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
112,"Amazon",2017-02-05,5,"Great app for prime music   Great app for prime music"
113,"Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Prime time   Amazon music is awesome! Since I am a prime member, I have free access to all kinds of great music. If you don't have amazon prime you should get it. The free shipping and music is definitely worth it!"
114,"Amazon",2014-08-29,1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, you know the rest.   Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."
117,"Amazon",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars   A++"
119,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"So very satisfied..   If you have prime, use this!  My musical tastes are vast.  If you sometimes vary far off the beaten path your needs will be met and expanded.So very satisfied... nothing is quite as good as being introduced to music you may like and having them hit the nail on the head.Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes."
120,"Amazon",2017-04-29,5,"Five Stars   One of the best music channels out there!!! Thank you Amazon!!"
122,"Amazon",2015-04-23,4,"I like it, wish it had more Hawaiian - - Jawaiian flare   I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music, I like it for the most part - there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free.  I took one star away because, like I said before - - it's only POPULAR music.  I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music.  Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music, but I'm more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio."

The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. It's o $2 less than Google Music which isn't much of a difference so decided to keep Google Music. Mainly, I don't want to have to go through and reset playlists also."
127,"Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"Music to my ears!   I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!"
128,"Amazon",2017-05-29,5,"Music App is BOMBIN!   It's awesome to be able to take my music anywhere!!"
130,"Amazon",2016-09-25,5,"Great solid app with tons of features   Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps."
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix   Great its part of Prime"
145,"Amazon",2017-03-06,5,"Love it   I am enjoying my music"
146,"Amazon",2017-05-05,5,"Five Stars   Good"
148,"Amazon",2016-10-26,5,"Move Over iTunes, there's a new kid on the block.   When I started looking at what was available it was like a time machine. There was my musical youth. I've found most of the albums I wore out in the 60's and 70's. All available to download into my tab and they're free with Amazon Prime. Move over iTunes there's a new and better alternative. Can't beat Free."
160,"Amazon",2017-05-11,5,"I like it   It works"
167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right   It's an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle, echo, music, prime, etc. they can't seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
171,"Amazon",2015-11-23,1,"Terrible app   Ugh, constant issues with the app not working. I receive an error code on many songs. Reinstall the app, have to reset up all playlists, redownload mp3s, clear cache, etc. and still it tanks. Now I can't even get it to download my purchase album- uuuuggggghhhhhh!!!!!!  I wish it would work as intended, as Prime Music is a great perk assuming we can actually use it as intended."
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five Stars   Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
190,"Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"is not that bad   The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3."
197,"Amazon",2016-07-04,5,"Five Stars   I was so happy to be able to have an offline mode to listen to the music."
201,"Amazon",2017-10-16,5,"Five Stars   I love being able to create my own playlists."
206,"Amazon",2016-07-07,5,"if you're subscribing to any other music service you're losing out   If you subscribe to any other music service and video service like Netflix or Hulu you're going to kick yourself for the price of commercial free Hulu you can get Amazon Prime which includes all the music you can download or stream all the movies you can watch and free Amazon 2 day shipping all for one low price. Fantastic deal"
208,"Amazon",2016-12-25,1,"I think of myself as quite well technicall aware person... but this all is the most horrible one i have ever encountered!!!   the worst app for moving music i have ever seen, im fan of amazon and using alexa with amazon echo a lot, but this app is something out of ordinary, you realy have to make an effort to design app so poor.what i think most people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription is upload music and then listen to echo when needed... but whole process is so slow and complicated, its not even worth using it. after few hours of trying to upload, i only managed to made my Echo play 10-20 of my music, out of 100s i tried to upload.whole process is designed to be worst possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats going is the guy who wrote the program.realy hoped that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 months passed and nothing.realy disappointed with amazon.... as said in the beguiling im real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this is just CRAP!!!"
210,"Amazon",2014-08-18,3,"Spotify is still a better deal.   I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce.  Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music.  If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead.  Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems.  Seriously, at  $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product."
211,"Amazon",2016-11-09,5,"Five Stars   Love this app. It has so many features."
213,"Amazon",2014-09-07,2,"Another bad marketing choice by Amazon dumped over the head of its Prime members as a ""bonus""!?!   I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime  Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."
214,"Amazon",2014-07-12,4,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works!   This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. It's a shame because of the amount of music available."
223,"Amazon",2017-07-19,5,"Why don't you have this?   If your a prime member, there's no reason not to use music. No interruptions, all kinds of choices. A must!"
224,"Amazon",2016-09-12,5,"love being able to select many songs that I like ...   love being able to select many songs that I like and have them played when I want....dissapointed that many artists are not available likeMichael Jackson"
225,"Amazon",2017-02-12,5,"AMAZON MUSIC   An awesome that provides me with all i need in music"
234,"Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"This app sucks   This app sucks.  I read there is not a charge it's free.  Ya right until you try to download a song.  I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance.  It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!!  Gee wiz"
242,"Amazon",2016-09-30,5,"Love using this app with my prime membership   Love using this app with my prime membership. Amazon has the best play lists and stations and my music sounds so much better with this app than others."
243,"Amazon",2017-01-24,5,"Five Stars   Damn good app"
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App needs some improvement.   I use this app all the time.  Unfortunately, it can not be used safely while driving.On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel.A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
249,"Amazon",2015-07-29,5,"I LOVE BEING AN AMAZON PRIME MEMBER!   When I first started this membership, I was skeptical with the service.  2 day delivery, free prime music, free prime movies.  But boy was I blown away!  My wife and I enjoy the Fast and Speedy delivery! When they say ""Guaranteed in 2 days"" THEY MEAN IT!  The free prime music and movies are better than what I bargained for and for what I paid with that 1 time payment, you will see you get Soo much more!  I'm just regular guy from NY that found this membership to be a great deal!"
251,"Amazon",2013-12-12,4,"Thx for putting fu nction ality back in!   I loved it, then there was an ""upgrade"" that broke everything... my main pain was losing lock screen controls, and shuffled lists... Well, finaly in update #3 or #4, the stuff is back! Amazon MP3 on my Android is usable again! I know if I had blue tooth radio, I could do without it, but as I do not - I depend on an easy way to skip a track - without unlocking the phone. I almost wish there were ""hot zones"" active if the phone is dark.. but whayt is there, is better than nothing, as was the case till few weeks ago!Not 5 stars, as the app could be better, and changes break it from time to time.. but certainly back to 4 stars!"
252,"Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffers, and stalls   For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it doesn't transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I'm not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
257,"Amazon",2016-09-28,4,"Wow!   Totally Great"
259,"Amazon",2015-06-17,5,"Love it   I'm still new to using it but I live it.  I've been trying to findicate something to play while I sleep.  I was using u tube but it would turn off if my screen went dark."
261,"Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"A Grandmother with an MP3 App?   I listen to music, as I take my daily walk.  I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable.  The Amazon MP3 app is amazing.  It's always there!  I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before.  The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick.  I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.  I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers."
266,"Amazon",2015-11-04,1,"never did figure out how to get any of the ...   never did figure out how to get any of the benefits of prime to work before my free trial ended. no clue how to play music or watch anything"
272,"Amazon",2017-11-03,2,"Only if you are dedicated to the Amazon ecosystem   Spotify is easier to use"
273,"Amazon",2016-06-06,5,"Great deal - I already had Prime for free shipping, now I have free music too   No commercials - good user interface.  The content is not as broad as Spotify but I found lots of music I like.  Also, Jason Aldean is on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
274,"Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Love love love Amazon!   I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
275,"Amazon",2015-12-02,4,"Great service   A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days."
276,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"Update sucks   This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card  continue listening to music.Not happy!"
277,"Amazon",2016-08-11,2,"Would NOT Work!   Would NOT play audio on android. Show that it's playing but NO! audio. Tried everything to no avail. Even reformatted device and still no audio!  DISSAPOINTED!"
280,"Amazon",2015-08-13,5,"Don't Wait - Get This App Today!   Amazon Music with Prime Music All kinds of music are passions of mine. I am a Prime Amazon member but have to say; next to the two-day shipping that Prime members receive, this is the second best feature offered. I have the app on my phone, my Kindle, and my computers. They ALL work great and I have not had any problems at all with them. The app has ""stations"" that I absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together. I can make my own playlists with east on all devices. You can separate each song by album, singer, or genre. The platform is the same on each device which is great - no further learning on each device. I have over 6,000 songs on my app and have used MANY other similar apps from other companies. They do not come close to this easy to use great app."
281,"Amazon",2016-07-23,4,"Lots of new music   The app itself could be easier to navigate, but I'm still going to give it a high rating because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not had a problem also getting to listen to that song on this app for free. Anyway, it's not a perfect interface but they make up for by giving a great selection of music."
284,"Amazon",2012-11-23,1,"stole my dollar   After buying some items on amazon I was rewarded a dollar to verbal song on amazon music I went to buy a song with that dollar and halfway through it says I don't have internet when I'm using WiFi I checked and my WiFi was fine so I switched to my 3g and tried it again and it still wouldn't download. So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents. I looked through everything with music and it never downloaded and I have no way of getting the songs unless I bought them again. What a rip off ! If there was a way to retrieved my songs I would be happy but as far as I can tell there isn't :("
286,"Amazon",2016-01-02,5,"I love this app.   This app has worked perfectly for me since I installed it.  I can download music and also stream from my library with no problems."
295,"Amazon",2015-01-05,5,"Got to have Amazon Music   OMG!!!  The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used."
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and ...   I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
302,"Amazon",2016-01-28,1,"amazon sucks   Terrible interface. Horrible when driving. Terrible blue tooth compatibility.  Playlists dont always transfer.  Terrible ability to scan for new music. Synching sucks. Slow as hell. A failure and disgrace for amazon."
311,"Amazon",2016-03-26,5,"Music,music,music!!!!!   I love music and this is the best I have found. I can't think of any song or artist that I haven't been able to find. Rock, r&b,pop,easy listening rock /opera,metal. It is awesome it,s not like the generic music apps. this ""thing"" has so many options and no commercials.  it really does listen to me and follows my lead. cool"
314,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   I think it's great! Better than Pandora."
316,"Amazon",2015-08-26,1,"Worst app and service ever there is never any good ...   Worst app and service ever there is never any good music to download without paying for it. I would be upset but its included in prime."
320,"Amazon",2016-05-30,5,"Amazing app!   Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music."
323,"Amazon",2016-10-25,3,"Not user friendly....   While this new version of Amazon Music holds mostly all of my music, it's not nearly as user friendly as the previous version."
324,"Amazon",2016-08-24,3,"Only use it if you already have prime.   Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this."
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime!   This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point.

I received a great gift from you   I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs.  It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs.  At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!!  I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Thank you Amazon !!"

In most corporate setting employees are not given the choice of browsers they use or what programs they may install, which in this case means I can no longer listen to my purchased music at work. The compatibility with only the latest IE browsers or installing non-IE browsers in an imposibility. I understand Amazon is in the money-making business but some of the recent changes make me think customer service is no longera priority."

If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it.

408,"Amazon",2015-08-14,2,"I *LOVE*Amazon Prime Music, BUT...   I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it.  It is a HUGE, space-consuming app!  Let me elaborate:  I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year.  I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l.  APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc.  Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon)  Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data!  Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!!  WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!?  This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed, I was constantly  receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work.  That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed.  This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!!  Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled.  When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"

It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."

However, the quality of cataloging the songs or albums solely depends on quality of mp3 ID tags.  Sometimes, the songs from the compilation albums may be split over several albums, and that's only because the ID tags associate the file with particular album.  If you are to load your own library of albums anything can happen.  However, the Mp3s downloaded from Amazon, whether the albums or compilations,  require no action in fixing ID tags."

Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."

I feel like I get my moneys worth with my Prime membership with so many benefits available. One of my smarter investments."
635,"Amazon",2016-01-18,3,"Love Prime Music, hate the app.   Prime Music is heaven for a music lover, and streaming through the website on my PC is easy.But the Android app is a thief. It keeps self-starting day & night, without authorization, using battery, running in the background no matter how often I ""Force Stop"" it or report it. I have a huge music library on microSD & flash drives & on my PC as well as in Amazon's cloud library.I can stream it through my Sony BluRay player to my with screen mirroring from my tablet - but I have to keep the tablet plugged in to keep playing for multiple hours. I don't bother from my phone, except for streaming music during dental work when I can connect, or on my phone during longish drives, plugged into the car charger.I wish they would fix it so it only started & ran when invited to do so! And to make it actually stop when stopped!"
638,"Amazon",2016-09-02,2,"Even Walmart does a better job at music downloads than Amazon   Couldn't find the file after downloading it to my phone. Only figured out that I had to use the Amazon music player to play the MP3 file.The least intuitive music download ever.  Even Walmart does a better job at music downloads than Amazon."
639,"Amazon",2015-04-09,2,"one plus   Using the one plus causes a plethora of problems. The number one issue is receiving the #181 error message when trying to play music. Please fix!"
641,"Amazon",2016-03-20,4,"Room for improvement   It would be better if you could download the songs to your device."
649,"Amazon",2016-02-10,5,"Great app...works perfectly !!!   Love it.I use it with my local Wi-Fi on my Android.Perfect app if you have AmazonPrime, and thus have seemingly limitless access to titles that span more than half a century, without having to pay for them, which makes paying for the occasional title not seem so big a deal."
654,"Amazon",2015-08-20,5,"Bought lots of songs on it. Very convenient. Easy to navagate menu on computer exe and phone app   Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while. The promo credit for shipping on a longer time schedule gave us the opportunity to buy lots of songs for free, now we are hooked. Too bad that promo ended."
655,"Amazon",2015-11-06,5,"Prime Over Pandora   Love Amazon music.  Prime music is awesome.  I have the ability to sample most music before I buy and Amazon Prime Playlists are free to listen to, giving me the ability to choose what music I want on the fly.  I also love the unlimited skip feature, which means that I never have to listen to a song that I don't care for."
657,"Amazon",2017-08-28,5,"Five Stars   Love the music app I can take my music anywhere I go on all my devices"
661,"Amazon",2016-11-27,3,"Generic   Playlist are just okay and new music could be guessed...wish more independent were hyped...how about imports and one time issues from artists? Not even an option to buy...music has far more fast or a lexicon...generic app!"

665,"Amazon",2016-12-14,5,"Beautiful choices are made available to us   Beautiful choices are made available to us.  I listened to the original sound recording of Hamilton with words screened on my phone. To enhance the quality I listened through my Bose Bluetooth.  Incredible experience."
669,"Amazon",2016-02-04,4,"Great music at your fingertips   I have enjoyed Prime Music's access to any hit I want anytime I want it. I have perused new music, classics--lots of genres. The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy."
670,"Amazon",2016-04-03,5,"love that i can listen to entire tracks   love that i can listen to entire tracks, and play what i want! sometimes the randomness of pandora isnt quite what im wanting, this fills those needs! Wish i could keep my prime account, but $100 at once is difficult.....now if it was $10/month....like everything else....just sayin"
672,"Amazon",2015-08-03,3,"Could do better.   Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this."
675,"Amazon",2016-06-17,4,"what's not too like..   Music ALL day, what's not too like... Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of hours, about 8hrs, music does repeat."
679,"Amazon",2016-03-29,5,"Arguably the best feature of being a prime member   Arguably the best feature of being a prime member.The playlists, the stations, the ability to download albums for offline playback...ALL FOR FREE (as a Prime Member) makes this a must have.If you are a prime member and are not utilizing this app, you are missing out!"
685,"Amazon",2016-06-29,5,"Five Stars   Great app"
687,"Amazon",2015-07-21,4,"Better than Spotify   I previously used Spotify almost exclusivly.  When Amazon released this app I tried it out and was very suprised at the amount of music available.  The stations are pretty good and you can easily download music to your devices."
694,"Amazon",2015-10-07,4,"All in all ok   All in all I have nothing to complain about, those 2 apps for video cameras are not working right (city cam and ispy) and I might be taking them off. The city cam freezes my phone and ispy is not coming in as it should, I have ispy on my windows 8 phone and on that platform it works right,but on the android it is scrambled."

700,"Amazon",2016-07-14,5,"Cant beat amazon prime!!   I have really enjoyed using amazon music with prime membership. Good selections and variety. I love ALL that prime membership has to offer.

706,"Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Definitely a great perk for prime members   The fact that you can download songs and playlists for free was unexpected.  Definitely a great perk for prime members."
707,"Amazon",2016-01-20,5,"Five Stars   This is cool. Like having my own Pandora"
711,"Amazon",2016-09-02,5,"Interesting concept, I like it.   Lots of new and different types of music to try and experiment with.  It's nice that it is included with the prime membership other wise I may not have even bothered using it.You can download a few items to make them available offline or when your connection is spotty, but after a while they are removed and you have to redownload them.I mainly use it to listen to classical music, and I have been able to find three new bands/musicians which I really like and would not have known about otherwise."
712,"Amazon",2016-03-01,5,"I like prime music   I like prime music.  Being able to stream and download music is really nice in the car.  You can can choose what songs you are listening to instead of a radio type app (like Pandora).  I haven't noticed my data use increase from other music apps.  The download feature is really nice."
714,"Amazon",2015-12-07,5,"I love my Amazon Prime   I love my Amazon Prime.  There are so many qualities about Prime, I honestly dont know where to start.  I get 2 day delivery for free.  I also get free music that comes with a lot of options.  You can also at friends to the Prime membership.  There are so many benefits you must get to explore all of them."
717,"Amazon",2017-10-30,4,"A great application, but there are drawbacks.   1. Not compatible with Samsung S7! I had to try very hard to install.2. Loaded music for some reason is divided into many categories for 2-3 songs. This is inconvenient, leave it as it is on the SD-card!"
719,"Amazon",2016-06-06,5,"DEFINITELY A GREAT APP.. I USE IT ON MY MOTORCYCLE... IT'S BETTER THAN PANDORA OR HEART   GREAT SELECTION--- I SPENT HOURS GOING THROUGH THE MUSIC THAT IS AVAILABLE AND HAVEN'T COME TO THE END OF THE SELECTIONS YET"

726,"Amazon",2016-11-25,1,"New Amazon Music version totally mixed my music, titles, songs & covers   This new version has totally mixed my music covers, songs, titles and artist!  I've done everything the has been recommended and nothing fixes it and you can't roll back to previous version!  Unhappy with this App!"
727,"Amazon",2016-05-12,4,"My favorite steaming music   Love the playlists based on artist or genera it has really expanded my artist like. The ability to make my own playlists is great too because I listen to many different types of music as does my boyfriend. It's extremely user friendly on my Samsung and his IPhone."

Difficult to get back to it as well.  Perhaps I dont have the hang of it, but I do have other sites that I use without a problem."
732,"Amazon",2016-12-04,5,"Amazing musical experience!   I love being able to look for a song that I've heard on the radio and find it on Amazon Music. Then I can create a folder of all the songs that I'm enjoying on any given day and play them on Alexa! Life is good!"
734,"Amazon",2015-07-23,3,"I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies ...   This is my last year because it costs too much.  I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies and books prime memberships.  It doesn't suck but it isn't  good enough either.  Streaming newer movies should never cost more than Red Box rentals who don't charge a membership fee.  I'd give it 3.5 stars but no way it gets four stars."
741,"Amazon",2013-01-09,5,"Best music app in any market   I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."
744,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   I love the variety of music that is available!"

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants music all in the one place both at home and when out and about ................."
748,"Amazon",2013-06-21,5,"Easy to use app   I like this app better than Google Play Music.Easy to use with a simple interface.  This app runs perfectly on the Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray)."

759,"Amazon",2015-06-22,2,"Great for Wi-Fi, no so great on Mobile Data   Love the service, hate this app. Constantly hangs on startup on my LG G3.

The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you don't make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently, now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can't even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I'd at least raise it back to like 4 stars."
774,"Amazon",2015-09-01,5,"Top of the line!   Best music program out there. Not only can I upload all of my own music and listen to it anywhere prime ha's more music than I could ever listen to.

846,"Amazon",2016-02-09,3,"Very nice Prime perk.   Lots of good music, some free, some not. I like that I can listen to any music that I had purchased, even when bought on CD. Amazon automatically provides a digital copy of any music you buy.  Only three stars as the app is not that easy to navigate. But overall pretty cool."
853,"Amazon",2014-06-15,2,"Ran poorly on my BlackBerry Z30   I downloaded this Android app onto my BlackBerry Z30 from the Amazon App Store. The app did run but it was very sluggish. I ended up uninstalling it for this reason and also because the song selection available for Prime Streaming was not huge. I do like the idea of this though as I am currently a Spotify customer and would love to see the song selection expanded. I will keep an eye on this service to see if it gets better."
857,"Amazon",2016-10-19,3,"Eats up internal storrage, won't use sd card   Love everything about amazon and prime except that i can't use my sd card for data, and thus can't use the app much.  Stinks to have 50 gigs of space but not be able to download 1 song.  Amazon please fix this!"

888,"Amazon",2015-06-12,5,"Amazon, you made this mom very happy!   I love this service.  They don't have every song I want to listen to, but they have most and they certainly have a library that is extensive enough to make great playlists.  My son and I use the service all the time to listen to music in the car.  There are no commercials, you can skip as much as you want and listen to your playlists in the order you choose.  This is perfect for me and I am thrilled that Amazon offers this service as part of my Prime membership."
890,"Amazon",2017-05-09,3,"messy/crowded UI, hard to use in car   it plays music well, selection seems to be pretty good, and eventually you can find what you want, but the dark and crowded navigation screens are hard to use in the car/bus/train.  it also takes too many clicks to get to where you want to be.suggestions:- completely mute (or pause) the music when a text or other notification comes in, or when the GPS tries to talk - right now i can't hear most text notification sounds over the music, and can just barely hear the GPS directions (google maps) over the music.- add optional light/dark themes to fit different peoples' tastes and environments- add a FAVORITES section so i can have all my stations, playlists, tracks, etc in one place instead of scattered all over.  more than once i've had to really search around for a station i had listened to a while ago, that was no longer listed in ""recents"".- add a CAR MODE with bigger buttons/text so it's easier to use - this would be especially useful for those of us with android car stereo units like this one: HIZPO Quad Core Android 5.1 Car DVD GPS for Toyota RAV4 2006-2012 with 1024x600 Capacitive Touchscreen support Steer Wheel Control Screen Mirror OBD2 TV DVR Stereo Bluetooth SD USB Radio Player"

898,"Amazon",2013-02-01,5,"Again Amazon gives you space saving technology   Not sure if you need the cloud, then you get this, as that is the way I did it.  But the MP3 uploader works fine.  It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded.  And I'm sure they covered every file type know.  Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech.  It's ease of operation is quite simple.  If you want things more complicated here, look elsewhere.  It's perfect for everyone from 8 to 80.  Excellent product."

912,"Amazon",2017-05-11,1,"Very unhappy with ""Unlimited"" Music   Very disappointed in this ""Unlimited Music"" plan. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and really liked ""Prime Music."" When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon. Wish it wasn't so."

914,"Amazon",2015-11-21,1,"Dissapointing sound quality   I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds."

My wife has accidentally used large amount of data playing music from Amazon when she thought it was downloaded to her phone, when it was really only added to her cloud. I would like for the app to make this a little more clear."
955,"Amazon",2014-09-26,4,"Great App! Just Bring The Equalizer To The Front.   I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."

958,"Amazon",2013-07-24,4,"Incredibly Convenient   Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click ok every time you open the app."

You will not be disappointed."
976,"Amazon",2015-12-02,3,"Okay but not great streamed music.   I notice quite a bit of clipping, it's not as clean sounding as Pandora running on the same device or machine. They do have a better selection of new releases and you can buy music right inside the app.  Has some strong points but it doesn't blow my hair back with music quality."
977,"Amazon",2013-07-13,5,"Works great   All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I'll come back to it. Cheers, Jerry"

I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!!

Really?I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."

I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed.

Thing is, that after you shut it off, the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.Second, it's hard to find a specific album... let's say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies. So I'll get my ""South City Midnight Lady"" and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. :o)"

I have installed this app on my phone through both the Amazon app store and through the Google Play store and neither way works.  I tap on the ""sign in to amazon"" button and....nothing.  nada.

I like that I can get channels with my Prime membership, but this app does not have a way to save favorite channels. It shows recently played channels, but that only gets in the way when you are experimenting. It really needs ""Favorites"""

I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that.  Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews.

Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise.  If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you?  Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now.  Right now?

1316,"Amazon",2014-03-21,5,"Music Made Easy   This is a fast easy to use app that brings music right to your phone. I love being able to download the music onto my phone instead of transferring it from PC  to phone. I also love that your purchases are saved in the cloud. Everyone knows how frustrating it is when your phone goes crazy and you lose everything. With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps. It's great."
1319,"Amazon",2016-09-26,5,"I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music   I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music. The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you don't like to listen to the same stuff over and over it's not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you don't get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there isn't a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT."
1320,"Amazon",2017-08-11,5,"Amazing!!   I love it!! Make playlists for my 5 mile walks.  Works great even a grandma can easily use it."
1323,"Amazon",2016-10-17,1,"Only thing good was it was free   Did not ask for it and do not know who authorized purchase. Only thing good was it was free. If it was automatic due to 30 day free trial of Prime, then it should say so. This way, people do not think their account has been breached."
1328,"Amazon",2016-11-10,5,"Lots of music to choose from!   As a prime user it has a lot of music to choose from. I've always found what I'm looking for. I also like the fact that I can listen to a huge Playlist offline."
1329,"Amazon",2015-03-11,3,"Great interface, but has some major issues design flaws that need fixing   App looks great and seems intuitive.  Why 3 stars?  No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card.  Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files.  I'm not sure why they do this.  It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files).  The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.Other major problems:- no automatic volume normalization.  Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song?- ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably.  I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there.- Cannot read reviews of songs/albums.  It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them"

1366,"Amazon",2015-03-16,4,"Great music tool, lacks radio choice   Great selection, great quality, lacks ""radio station"" like ability.  So I can select a bunch of stuff to ""add to my selection"" but I can't (or can't find it) select a simple set of music (ie Genre) to play or stream like a radio.  However, I do love it...it's become my go to music source"
1367,"Amazon",2013-10-04,4,"easy   since i am not that tech savvy this entire process had me fearful, but it was easy to download, use and buy songs with.  don't hesitate."

1371,"Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"its OK...not great.   I am not a misic junkie.  I Dont have spotify or itunes and stuff...I use Google's all access...its better for me. This service would be great if it offered the same volume of songs as Google.  I use Google to pick up current songs to play as I write fiction. My most inspirational songs are all free on Google.  Out of 86 Amazon had 10 free.  Not worth it honestly."
1372,"Amazon",2014-06-18,2,"I want the old version back!   The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list.  On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs [lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the ""now playing"" screen inside the app], but they don't work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth.  The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first.  This is beyond annoying!  And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state.  I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do.  This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public.  It makes me regret downloading the update."
1373,"Amazon",2015-04-25,5,"I really like Amazon Music w/ Prime   I really like Amazon Music w/ Prime, if for no other reason than I can take my phone in the car and play music I like, instead of relying on my old factory installed radio, lol.

1375,"Amazon",2013-01-10,5,"The cloud player for me   Terrific concept: just what a cloud player should be!  Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer.  Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there."
1377,"Amazon",2013-01-18,3,"Hassle downloading from computer to phone   Once I downloaded the Amazon MP3 player on to my adroid phone it was very difficult to get any information on how to download songs from my computer to the MP3 player.  I had to call Amazon's customer service number 4 times before anyonetold me that first you had to download the amazon app along with the steps for the android phone as well as the amazon download installer before anything would work. Once it was working it was fine but way too much hassle to begin with."
1379,"Amazon",2016-02-04,5,"Better than Beats / Apple Music   Just started using this app. My wife and I are pleased sofar. We had Beats Music as part of our ATT plan then it was axed and we refuse to use anything associated with Apple since its now Apple Music. Thanks for a great app."

My guess is that it won't be the case if you buy the song. Either way, it's not a versatile music app, sucks your battery, and it's not even nice-looking.Only good part is that it sincronizes well with the amazon app and you can import the mp3 already on your device"

If there was a user friendly desktop interface like iTunes they would have five stars.  Keep working on it amazon you have my business, I hope you continue to develope your  music products."

1662,"Amazon",2011-11-12,3,"Could be killer   Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well."
1663,"Amazon",2015-01-23,2,"Fix this thing!   Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
1668,"Amazon",2016-03-02,4,"Really like the playlists and stations   Really like the playlists and stations. Would be good if more recent stuff was included but when you look what you are paying for Amazon Prime and all the other benefits, not bad value for money."

1684,"Amazon",2015-06-24,3,"Easy to use but...   Easy to use but requires some improvements:- Exit option. Application still running all the time.- Usage of SD card storage. Currently the application use device storage to keep offline music. A few albums will full device space. Offline files are DRM protected. They could be stored in SD without any problem.- Clear SD space. After removing offline music the application does not remove files from storage.- Optimize memory consumption. I own a Samsung S4. This application use more memory than similar applications, reaching almost 100% memory usage.I hope Amazon implement these improvements soon."

1774,"Amazon",2014-12-16,1,"Leaves me scratching my head   If you have 8 gb total on the internal storage and 32 gb of external storage (sd), you want to put large files, like music, on the external card. When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage."

Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."

I guess I would use music on my phone in the car if driving through an area where radio reception isn't so good. Seems easier to just turn on the car radio or play a CD. I know people listen to music on their phones wearing headphones while jogging, commuting etc."
1959,"Amazon",2014-12-16,5,"Better than itunes!   I honestly don't know why anyone would go with itunes when this is available. I love this service. I use it instead of Pandora or itunes.

1990,"Amazon",2017-05-31,3,"Meh... it's okay. Maybe I'm hoping for too much.   It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."

I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I couldn't stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library. Didn't have to do a single thing but open up her back up and watch all the musical geniuses roll in. I give this app 10 stars out of 5. Way more than I expected for the money."
2031,"Amazon",2016-03-04,5,"LOVE THIS AMAZING AP   I found this app a month or so ago and now use it everywhere I go, every day!! If I'm not streaming your music, I can play my own through the app. LOVE THIS AMAZING AP!!!"

The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.The UI has gotten much better over the last year.

Now that I've been using it for awhile, I feel like a fool for not having used it before! Sure, not every artist is available to stream, but many hours of music are available. The ability to add songs to your library, make play lists and sort by artist, song or genre make this a very usable way to enjoy music. I still listen to Pandora and have found a lot of new music that way. But there is nothing like being able to punch up that perfect song for whatever mood your in, assuming of course it's available..."

I wanted to pull them down from the cloud onto my phone but kept putting it off.  The app makes it too easy to keep procrastinating.  You can download or stream and shop for more music and buy with 1-click. The app functions fine on my HTC Incredible 2, no bugs so far.  Recommend it without hesitation."
2133,"Amazon",2014-06-22,4,"Awesome !   When I was told about this opportunity, it didn't faze me until I was shown the range of music to choose from. Pandora was more bothersome but I was able to listen to my favorites with such ease I was amazed. It sent me dancing throughout the house. Thanks I have it on my iPad and Galaxy. Just awesome!"

2192,"Amazon",2015-03-29,2,"A lot of hard work and it may function   This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn't. It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I've always installed from the play store, let's see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE,  LG G3,  that just might run amazon prime music, but it's just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
2197,"Amazon",2015-01-07,1,"can't download to sd   The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device.

2249,"Amazon",2016-07-18,5,"What's not to like about it?   This is an added bonus with a Prime membership, and as such, it's great!The selection is a little limited compared to other music streaming services, but that's not a problem for me.They've added new features like radio stations and curated playlists, so I find myself using this app and the web player quite frequently.The mobile app allows to download songs and playlists for offline listening, so that's a great feature. Though the downloaded songs will not be detected by other media player apps on the device.It's not pushy in trying to make me buy more music. There are no ads.I did not find this app for my smart TV and Blu-ray player, so that was disappointing. But some media players like Roku support it, so you could use your home theater to listen to Amazon Music."

Listen to me take the time to check the whole "" Prime offer "" out before you decline.

I have even given them the firewall logs of my phone to show what servers, ports, times, etc the app is trying to connect to.  That way it makes their jobs very simple to troubleshoot by simply looking at an error code on that server.  They have had 16 months and can't seem to do a simple task such as that.  I am a 17 year Network Engineer and do this kind of stuff day in and day out.  My PRIME account is useless but yet I paid over $100 for 16 months now to stream music.....no dice.

I fondly remembered all the novelty tunes of the 1970's which were played regularly on the radio.  But how to listen again?  I certainly don't want entire albums in some cases.  So I picked out the ones I like from Amazon MP3, and viola - back to the fun times.  Thank you , Amazon MP3."

There is no access to playing music from ""the cloud"".  I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.Update - Turns out the issue is with the device.  A reboot and the app works fine.  This is also the case with a few other apps that were included on the device.  So I'll be knocking a star of my Acer review."

2945,"Amazon",2014-06-15,3,"It is OK   The music selection has a fair number that I like, but the biggest drawback for me is the app for my Android tablet.  It has no shuffle play within a disc and no shuffle play across discs.  I was hoping for a mini radio station with only my chosen artists."

The items were picked, and all that was left was my payment for the difference in price.The agent who was working on this... stopped responding via email.The agent who was chatting.... stopped responding to chat.So, I am left with product I cannot sell.... and the empty promise of compensation that will never happen.In the meantime, Amazon continues to lose money, and business in general.... and we wonder why?"

3036,"Amazon",2015-03-11,2,"lacking   Without Chromecast support this is just another portion of amazon prime that locks you into buying Kindles and Fire TV. It's a lack of flexibility like this that has kept me away from Apple lately."
3039,"Amazon",2015-04-07,5,"Music so convenient   Amazon continues to surprise me with excellence. Amazon Prime Music is enriching each day with album listening that hasn't been so convenient and available. Worth the Prime membership itself."

3103,"Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"BAH! Amazon Music with Prime   I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

3983,"Amazon",2016-06-17,2,"They broke the shuffle feature   Under normal circumstances this app deserves a good solid 4 stars. With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs."

4155,"Amazon",2013-12-17,2,"Amazon Cloud is great, but Android app has some killer limitations   I pay $25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I'm very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I've got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.So far, so good.But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:1) It won't download music to your SD cardI bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data).But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloudI was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!3) No gapless playback.Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."
4157,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Five Stars   Excellent service, excellent choices"
4158,"Amazon",2016-08-19,5,"Music must have app   I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on  my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime."
4161,"Amazon",2015-07-04,3,"It's getting better, but I still have problems with it force ...   It's getting better, but I still have problems with it force closing on me. With or without letting me know. Sometimes, it'll tell me there's a problem try again, and other times it'll just stop and we'll stop. No warning. But other than that, I love that I can listen to full albums without interruptions though. I also love that I can search through Amazon prime to find more music as well while listening to music still. It shows whats available on amazon prime. Love that. A few fixes and then this would be a great app and would get 5 stars."

One huge complaint, however, is when I download music to my phone's SD card or create a playlist on my phone (as opposed to in my cloud). My music and playlists keep disappearing from my memory card!!! Very frustrating."
4951,"Amazon",2017-04-05,1,"Can't even get it installed   I have triple checked the compatibility but it errors out when I try to install. I had to write this review on a PC as it won't even allow me to review the app on my device until I have successfully installed it. So there's probably a whole lot of people out there in the same boat who can't review because they can't install."
4952,"Amazon",2014-04-15,1,"Does not work at all on my Android 4.1   In order to work it forcing me to change language on my device (!).I think if device language is not supported by app, app should gracefully degrade to most popular languages - English or Chinese."

4998,"Amazon",2014-06-26,5,"Great!   I have been a prime member for years and this just makes the membership even more worth while.  I have added so many songs to my Prime Music library that it's hard to choose what to play!"

5006,"Amazon",2014-06-14,1,"Doesn't work in Canada   I am an expat and bought many albums before moving to Canada. Very annoying that the app doesn't work on my Canadian phone, despite the fact that I still have a US address and credit cards."

5033,"Amazon",2016-03-02,4,"Four Stars   Love it, but could use a few more artists in Christian rock"
5035,"Amazon",2016-08-17,1,"Zero morality settings, ZIP   This app has a LONG way to go.  But it's all you can use with Prime music.  Searching for music comes up with lame knock-off remixes, and bands instead of the original artists.  That is SO LAME. Also, there is NO EASY WAY to setup preferences to NEVER EVER find and/or playback explicit lyrics!  Completely hazardous to family values.  I would say that most people do NOT want to hear music that sings F_CK and B_ITCHES and MOTHERF_CKER all the time.  Do NOT listen to ""RnB"" music on Amazon unless you like hearing the F word 1000 times per work day."
5037,"Amazon",2016-05-23,5,"Wonderful perk of having prime.   Love,love,love. Can even listen off-line."

5054,"Amazon",2015-02-21,4,"Downloading?   The only thing I wish is that the Library music could be downloaded.  I live in the sticks and lose signal while driving quite a bit."
5056,"Amazon",2014-07-22,5,"What's not to like!   So excited about this.  I have an extensive music collection but haven't downloaded to my phone.  This was so easy in no time at all I have hundreds of my favorites ready to enjoy."
5057,"Amazon",2016-10-03,3,"Three Stars   OK for now"
5059,"Amazon",2013-05-10,3,"Fits and starts   I like the convenience of being able to listen to my amazon MP3 purchases from other devices, but I found that it takes a lot of memory to run and often times has to pause and buffer, even in good coverage areas. I mainly use it in my car on my android phone,"

I can access my personal playlists easily. Amazon playlists are just as easy to access, navigate and choose by genre and mood. Even better, if I like a song on one of Amazon's playlists, I can add it to my personal playlist with just a couple of touches. I've found Amazon Music for Android even easier to use than the version for PC. Good job, Amazon."

10723,"Amazon",2016-10-28,1,"Avoid if possible:  Time to start over, Amazon!   Klunky, frequent user interface lockups and crashes, and can't play songs without hiccupping, pausing, and crashing - and that's just from downloaded, local storage on my phone!  Considering that playing a local audio file has been done smoothly by PCs since about 1988, this is a big disappointment.  If it wasn't required to utilize my Amazon Prime music, I would ditch this one in a heartbeat.  I have already wasted too many minutes of my life working with this app."

10890,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"Wonderful.   I just wish it could pull music from my Google collection. The new update is excellent, I must say! The only downside to it, which is minor, is that it is locked in portrait mode. Getting that fixed and the ability to include and stream valid mp3s from,  or merge with, Google music library."
10892,"Amazon",2017-04-28,3,"I like that there is music available on Amazon   I like that there is music available on Amazon, but the selection isn't super without paying extra and the app freezes my phone all of the time.

10928,"Amazon",2014-10-23,4,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums ...   Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I'm not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it's not a big deal.Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
10931,"Amazon",2016-10-25,1,"There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request but I'm not happy in doing   It wont load into my Droid Turbo 2. There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request that I'm not happy in doing. This is the WORST. I sent a report but no response.Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs."
10935,"Amazon",2014-04-16,4,"love it   Now I can have my music whereever I go without having to take along a separate mp player. my grandkids like it because it has their favorite music on there as well. You can play from the cloud or download to your mobile device."
10942,"Amazon",2012-02-21,2,"I really want to live this app, and I ss   I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days.and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker.I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloudThis review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint"
10948,"Amazon",2013-12-16,5,"My music on my device!   I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on.  Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices.  However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want.  Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!"
10951,"Amazon",2017-09-29,5,"Convenient library streaming   Nice to be able to stream 250 of my mp3s. I would probably go for the expanded service if I had a ton more music I wanted to access remotely always, or if it was a bit cheaper."
10956,"Amazon",2011-08-24,1,"A piece of garbage   App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App   I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10962,"Amazon",2014-10-31,4,"Great extra with the prime membership   Great extra with the prime membership.  I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have.  I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music.  It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly.  I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
10965,"Amazon",2017-06-23,5,"Great tunes   Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's didn't hammer us with usage charges"
10968,"Amazon",2017-02-01,1,"So much bugs   After opening app, the first time after a while ""+ Add album to my music""  button is pressed I am redirected to an amazon prime screen, and the album I selected is lost. It takes multiple attempts to purchase mp3s. Headache after headache using the store."
10973,"Amazon",2016-10-01,5,"Five Stars   ok"
10977,"Amazon",2014-08-02,1,"Useless on my android phone   The app is more frustration than enjoyment on my Android phone.  I have given up on it working and have uninstalled it."
10980,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"Amazon Prime Music   I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time."
10983,"Amazon",2017-06-21,1,"Boooooo   Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago"
10988,"Amazon",2013-02-21,3,"It's free, and it works with my cloud music collection   While it's pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches)."
10989,"Amazon",2013-02-07,5,"Fantastic App!!!   I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it.  All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service.  You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone.  It's great!"
10990,"Amazon",2017-09-17,5,"Five Stars   I love the instant rip and available music with my prime subscription."

10992,"Amazon",2011-06-30,1,"This program is not just bad its damaging.   I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."
10996,"Amazon",2017-09-25,1,"One Star   Worthless if you can't get the prime member music"
11007,"Amazon",2017-05-05,4,"Four Stars   There's some decent music on it but the variety is limited."
11009,"Amazon",2016-10-18,1,"New tunes stuck in jail with no key to get out.   Amazon lacks the ability to share files or it hides instructions or directions on how to do it. I just purchased a number of Adele tunes but can't transfer them to my Google play library.  Why?"
11013,"Amazon",2014-10-13,1,"Frequent errors and crashes   App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible"
11031,"Amazon",2014-10-21,4,"Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was ...   Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there's always a little freeze in the playback when I'm streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I'm really satisfied"
11032,"Amazon",2013-02-13,4,"Amazon MP3 to the rescue   There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train."
11034,"Amazon",2014-04-23,4,"App works well.   I like being able to get my Cloud music and play it on my phone. The one problem I have with it is that without me adding them in there it picked up ringtones I had downloaded to my phone and put them in my list of songs. I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well."
11037,"Amazon",2014-10-23,1,"No longer works on the OnePlus One!!!   This app used to work fine on my OnePlus One, but now it crashes all the time.  Please fix ASAP so that I can enjoy it once again.I believe there might be a compatibility issue with the latest CM 38R update?"

11044,"Amazon",2013-02-11,5,"10 STARS   Perfect. Fast downloads. Much better than itunes. The new auto-rip feature for cds is wonderful. I hope it will include vinyl in the future. (Sooner rather than later)  Love it love it love it!!!"
11047,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"Ejoying The Benefits of Prime!!!!   I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash. What I liked most of all was the access to the many music playlists that are available and also the music that had been on my wish list for years were made available through Prime. Thank you. Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
11054,"Amazon",2013-02-09,4,"I love listening to my music on here, and is easy to put on protable devices.   I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also don't have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient."

11065,"Amazon",2013-02-25,4,"Amazon MP3   I buy a lot of my music from Amazon, so this app is perfect for downloading and syncing that music without any fuss. I don't use it as a player, because I don't play it off the ""cloud"" and I have a much better program for playing the music on my device."
11066,"Amazon",2014-10-13,2,"from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime   Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime.  I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song."

11090,"Amazon",2014-10-12,4,"I love to use this app   I love to use this app.  The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due.  I am not sure I can justify $99 for this privilege.  It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music."
11094,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"great idea but Amazon needs to work out a few bugs.   Love the included music.  Prime has even more value now.The App locks up on my mobile phone and the browser version has a few querks."

11096,"Amazon",2014-10-27,1,"NOT USEFUL AMAZON!   Even with ""Prime"" you still have to pay for songs or albums!  You only get snippets of the music for free, then are required to purchase the individual song or album to hear it in it's entirety. NOT USEFUL AMAZON!"

11102,"Amazon",2014-12-28,2,"Needs some work   Can use a revamp on the usability of adding and playing music.Not easy to determine what free music is available via prime."
11103,"Amazon",2014-05-28,1,"Now I cant use any apps   Says there is a login error and to try signing in again.  None of the ""fixes"" I found online worked.  It won't let me use any apps I purchased from Amazon until I login.  I'm never buying another app from Amazon."
11104,"Amazon",2014-06-18,5,"Love the new Prime feature   Good operation so far. The search engine defaults to search every song in Amazon library which is a small inconvenience when searching for Prime music only. Also haven't figured out yet how to create my own playlists."
11110,"Amazon",2011-05-17,4,"Keeps my SD space free.   Not the greatest looking mp3 player around, but good enough.  Functions well, though network hiccups are common.  Fits a need till Google Music goes public."

11635,"Amazon",2016-02-07,1,"Unimaginably bad.   I got the app in December and got all my music organized, stored all on an SD card and playlists set up (which you can do only one song at a time), then shortly after it stopped reading most of the songs on the SD card. I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files. Make sense?"

The case requires you to unscrew 6 small screws in the front to use insert your phone.  It's not a standards size screw you would typically have a screwdriver for around the house.

I used to tell my friends about it but now....not so much. Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely. I can't get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate. Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan."

Amazon music unlimited does have a fair amount more, but it is a good selection for a free app (with a prime membership). There is a small glitch that causes the app to not play the song you selected at first when you change albums, but when you select it again it works. It has music stations and albums to download. All and all it is worth a download if you have a prime membership. If you do not have a prime membership I would use google play music, because it seems to have less glitches."
11703,"Amazon",2015-01-16,1,"How bad can it get?   I have purchased 894 songs from 146 albums.  When I purchase new music it is simply impossible to tell what has already been downloaded.  ""Drag music here to download?""  WHAT???  This is a computer for crying out loud.  Can't you TELL ME what hasn't already been downloaded?  Present me with a list?  DOWNLOAD ALL???Drag to a list to download?  I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972.  THE WORST I have ever run into!It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud.  The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public.  The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house.  My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just doesn't work AT ALL out in the world.  I need to download to my devices.  ALL OF THEM!  All my music.Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO.  And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.Sadly, Amazon doesn't care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.Buying the music is dead simple, and I like to support the artists, and listen to the music I love.  Buy getting it to my devices.WOOF, what  nightmare!!!"

11717,"Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"Luv Everything Amazon   This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH!  I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap.  Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music.  I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music.  Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight??  if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant.  The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device.  If u own the music u can download to ur device  (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data.  And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here).  it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this:  u can download aNY of the music u want.  However, u can only move the music you own.  Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it.  MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage.  Hopefully,  most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer."
11726,"Amazon",2014-06-14,2,"Bug ridden release!   I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review."
11729,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Terrible Service   It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there .

11731,"Amazon",2015-12-01,2,"Make the app self report errors...   While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible.  It fails repeatedly.  It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service.  Why does the app not send this report itself?  Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again.  Today I was just trying to edit a playlist.  I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start.  I don't want to call customer service.  Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?"
11733,"Amazon",2014-09-27,1,"There are better apps out there   This app is an absolute mess.  If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time.  For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app (which worked great), this an ""upgraded"" version of that app that's just completely missed the mark.I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud.  So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those.  That's really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.My current issues with this app:- Freezing - This app freezes constantly.  I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work.  Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.- Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens.  It's actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up.  Finally when I accept that I can't skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs.- Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works.  And it never fails, it always stops working when I'm on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.- Playlists that don't shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.- Always have to choose repeat and shuffle.  Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with.  Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order.  The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance.  But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast.  The only reason I continue to use this app is because I've invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music.  I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.If you don't have a huge investment in Prime Music and you're just looking for a music app, definitely look elsewhere.If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review."
11741,"Amazon",2016-01-07,2,"let's you DL your music directly to MicroSD; still no gapless play or equalizer, still needs major work   Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).That being said... this app still needs major work.DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!"

11747,"Amazon",2013-08-18,1,"No Download Location Setting   Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched.  Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well.  There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."
11753,"Amazon",2016-12-10,2,"Not a robust Music source   Several issues with this software/service.  It does not work on Roku yet except to access my purchased music.  Can't find other music or playlists.  Then on my BLU Advance 5 phone (Android) from Amazon, the app hogs itself into the main memory of the phone and will not move to the added SD card.  As a result (like other Amazon apps), they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.Overall, on other platforms, I don't find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music, building playlists, or creating ""stations"" of my own.  At this stage, I am staying on Pandora."

When I do stream, it often changes to a different album on it's own.  I also like using Power Amp because it works predictably and the sound is much better.  Even the headset buttens in Amazon are unpredictable.  I have not been able to upload the last album to my phone.  Sometimes it will down 1 to 3 songs but will not download the entire album.

The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.

Apple gets it right but when I upload to Amazon they can't get it right.  I have spent hours on hours trying to correct album covers.  Just gave up.  There is an easy solution.  Let me update the album cover on your website like Google Music does.  What I have learned is that if you adjust music titles or album names, you might get the right cover to show.  Also, having the right cover on the website does not mean that the right cover will show up on a Kindle Fire device.  Or, it might be wrong on the website, but will be right on the Kindle Fire.  Go figure.  They have until my subscription expires to fix this.  Too many other services that get it right to keep paying for this one.  Apple gets it right.  XBOX music gets it right.

11782,"Amazon",2016-11-18,1,"As of this moment, the worst music app in the history of music apps.   I used to love this app (when it was still an orange icon).  The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes.  I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes.  It was much easier to navigate while driving.  The latest update ruined that.  It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving.  Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it.  It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums.  So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists.  Ridiculous!Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs.  Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album.  No other songs, just the one song. Go figure.  What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether.  For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics book.  Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book.  I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on.  Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums.  So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.The controls are my biggest issue with this new update.  What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums.  The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone.  Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently.  THAT song is still there.  Everything else is literally wiped out.  I'm done.  I'm going back to iTunes.  Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."
11784,"Amazon",2015-12-16,5,"Cool App   I've used several different streaming music apps.  Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.I like it!  It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever.  I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels.  Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora.  Other than that, I like this app,  I can pause, skip and shuffle.  It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."

11786,"Amazon",2017-01-02,2,"... Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon ...   The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the $14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. Wasn't getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I don't have a 3 month credit so we weren't able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. ""Credits"" don't seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo weren't worth their cost. Wouldn't recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I'll be sticking with Pandora."

I've stopped using Pandora altogether.  Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it.  The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time.  Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else.  Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great.  Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora.  I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release!  If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion.  I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see.  I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."

I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the ""music unlimited"".

For example, if I download ""My Life"" from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play ""Only the Good Die Young"" even if I haven't downloaded it.

I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped."

I was getting Disk Full errors on my phone when I realized it's been storing the music I play in a cache on my INTERNAL STORAGE.  When I looked to see if I could change the location, that option didn't exist.I had to plug the phone into a Windows machine and use Explorer to clear out the cached music.  1.8GB of cached files!  Amazon, you can do better than that.  Give us the option to set the cache location or give up on the cloud streaming business because this WILL NOT WORK."

So I copied a few of my discs to the hard drive and uploaded them. All the tracks said duplicate. Yet still not in the cloud. Even more frustrating they all show up on cell phone app. Even more frustrating than that, cant download from cell phone. Amazon all I can say is grrrrrrrrr."
11853,"Amazon",2016-06-15,3,"Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists ...   I purchased Prime so I could have the music option (music + free shipping was worth it to me, same or a little less than paying the $9.99 for rhapsody). Prime does not seem to have the newer albums (Rihanna, Blake Shelton just as two examples). Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists that I CAN find on spotify). I was able to make playlists which was nice but when I play the playlists it stops after every couple of songs (receiving notifications does not make a difference in the playlist, it just stops playing randomly) but then other times it plays all the way through...I would say this is the biggest frustration. Also, it is slow at downloading. When I had rhapsody it was lightening fast, almost so much so I would lose track of where I was! If you download a few different songs at at time it takes a while to do and you can't search for other songs in the meantime. If Amazon doesn't fix these features I may consider cancelling when my year is up and going with another music app."

I have not got into the movie part yet but I plan to very soon. I bought a good blue tooth speaker that makes the music sound awesome. I wish this was all a little easier to work and learn. I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I look forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part.

The selection is now top notch (if you pay for Music Unlimited) and the app works MUCH better than Apple Music on Android!  Being that pretty much my entire purchased music library is on Amazon Music, Music Unlimited seemed like the no brainer choice for my music subscription service.  So far I have been very impressed and would highly recommend it to anyone!!  The app features full albums, stations, and playlist..  The app is easy to navigate!!  The app is easy to download or stream..  And overall, I have had no issues with the app.. I highly recommend it"

The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in ""airplane"" mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."

11867,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Amazon Music Unlimited Review   Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available.  However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to...  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."
11869,"Amazon",2015-08-21,5,"Yup it'll keep me being Prime   Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi.  The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."
11870,"Amazon",2015-01-06,5,"Would give 0 stars if possible   Crashes every time I want to play a song that's downloaded to my device (android 4.4) whether or not I'm connected to the internet at the time. Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that aren't downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. That's right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.UpdateThe app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign isn't as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there."
11872,"Amazon",2017-01-26,5,"Really Awesome!!!!   Love Amazon music! It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi (perfect for airplanes). Would recommend this!!!"
11873,"Amazon",2012-10-24,4,"My go-to music app!   UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012.  My how times have changed.  The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music.  If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
11876,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"promising but...   I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved.  There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently.  Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."
11878,"Amazon",2013-12-07,1,"Build 3.0.2 mistake.   I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud.  I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone.  This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars.  When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the ""now playing"" list.  This is no longer an option.  Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.Time for a version rollback :)  I wish.Another ""feature"" I just discovered:  When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order.  (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness)  This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks."
11882,"Amazon",2017-04-28,1,"Not usable unless u live in US or Canada   I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad."
11884,"Amazon",2016-07-07,1,"Inadequate music selection   I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection."
11886,"Amazon",2015-07-08,2,"Amazon Music.. it's 2015 and YOU SUCK   How can this app STILL not allow you to save purchased music to an SD card?  How simple was that to program!? OMG..

Being the best online retailer on the web, I was sure that this was the place to let my teen buy music for their Android phone.. until it FILLED UP THE PHONE'S SYSTEM MEMORY!!  You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates (going forward) involves taking out the SD card (periodically), and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!! Don't BOTHER to suggest third party apps that can't GUARANTEE that all album images will move with the mp3s and be accessible by the CLOUD.  Major fail... YOU SUCK.  Sadly a great online retailer will be losing my music purchases due to lousy app."

Free music selection is very broad and I enjoy hundreds of songs on PC, tablet, and android phone.  Good options for automatically downloading new library additions device by device.  Also allows you to store owned music that CAN be shared -"
11889,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"It Sucks!!!   Yesterday the Amazon mp3 app on my phone updated and went from a great app to one of the worst I've ever used.  It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages.  It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it.  It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV."

Good quality and everything. Then a new update came out and now I cannot add any music to my library because they are all now premium subscription. Now they are trying to make me pay extra to listen to music that was originally free!? And I have so many songs that if I don't upgrade to this new premium standard I have to either A: one by one download every song through a new app. Or B: Be forced to upgrade to keep my music. I thought amazon was awesome before and now they are getting greedy and I guess my money for prime is now not enough. Very disappointed"
11892,"Amazon",2016-11-05,4,"Good variety   I like having the option to listen to varied stations and my own list from anywhere.  Maybe I haven't done enough research, but I do not know why one day I am able to listen to some songs, then the next they are no longer available to Prime members."
11893,"Amazon",2017-03-02,4,"Great for Prime users   Great option for prime subscribers, you can set up a library of your long lost music. Also listen to complete CDs before you buy. I really suggest looking into the library option."

I actually really like this app as a Prime Member but the one GIANT mess up that I see is the need for data even to play music that is downloaded. I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me."
11899,"Amazon",2016-12-19,2,"Latest updates hard to use   I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad."

Let me download all the music and you fix the problem.  You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music.

When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time?

Second, when it works, you get Constant &#34;nag&#34; screens &#34;reminding&#34; you in the most intrusive way possible to try out Amazon's new Prime Music service.

Finally, the newest update won't even open without crashing and it keeps trying to open itself and ends up in a &#34;crash loop&#34;.

It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation.  So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory.  It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it.  They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps.  You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card.  But it doesn't always work.  It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs.  While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure.  I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.  So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right.  Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.

With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!"
11953,"Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"Not bad, unless your device has small built-in storage, or you have poor data connection.   UPDATE:I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.___________I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."

Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation?  Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background?Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.  Has anyone tried navigating Amazon's AWS portal to check the usage statistics? It's like a US Government web site - bloated, confusing, full of unneded noise."

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!"

Some may say that ""it's included with prime so why complain?"", but at this point it's a better option to just pay for shipping normally if you need to and sign up for rhapsody or spotify (or save even more and don't use streaming services).It's just unnecessary and costly. Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits, but when they decided to attach video (again not as good as netflix or hulu)  and music to it and double the price, I cancelled my membership renewal. I would prefer a tier set up where you can elect which services you want, but i suspect that would reveal just how overpriced the services are and Amazon would lose too much money to keep them around."

Amazon Music says it can handle 250,000 songs, which is great for large libraries, so I uploaded tens of thousands of songs I had ripped and purchased over the years. Every CD I owned, every digital song I purchased, all of them of the last 40 years. This process took forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way."

The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone.

I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I'd used 1GB of data that I didn't even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I've used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I'd be paying now.Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it (there is no off button and you can't get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise), and now it's got a pop up asking me to log in that you can't get out of by pressing the back button.

Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"

Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this....

I finally discovered that pushing the back ""button"" twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.

I can only access Recently Played, Recommended Stations, and a couple of other avenues that Amazon tries to force feed me. I have no way to browse the THOUSANDS of songs I purchased THROUGH AMAZON. I can't access My Playlists, nothing.

It even gets to the point where I'm not even surprised anymore. When I first started listening to this station, I would hear songs and think, ""Wow, I haven't heard this in a while"". Now, they seem to play the same 10-20 songs, and I think, ""Oh, this again."". Come on now! If you're going to call this station ""All 90's"", play ALL 90's music."

12051,"Amazon",2015-07-05,2,"Mediocre interface, frustrating glitches, and limited library   The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I don’t need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. You’d think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players don’t seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."

12072,"Amazon",2015-06-11,4,"Best Place To Buy Digital Music   Prime music is the best place to purchase digital music.  Unlike iTunes which only makes purchases available to my iTunes library, Prime will place downloads in both my iTunes and Windows Media Player libraries.  We've found that prices for digital music is better, on average, than iTunes too -- at least on my PC.  If they could figure out a way to put downloaded purchased music in my iTunes library on my iOS devices that would make it even better.  But for now I'll just have to live with syncing my devices with my PC.I also wish the selection of streaming music on Amazon was better.  This is one place where iTunes and their radio service has Amazon beat.One thing that makes Amazon and their Prime Music service stand out from the rest is when we get free digital copies added to our prime library when we purchase CDs on Amazon.  Now I don't have to wait for the CD to arrive and rip it to get it on my portable devices.  Sometimes you can find albums for sale at a cheaper price on CD than if you buy the download only version.I also like the streaming Prime music library.  It's like listening to the radio and we can eventually purchase the songs we like so they can be played offline or after they are removed.  I suppose this will be treated like the Prime Instant Video service where tunes that were once included with our Prime membership will suddenly become purchase only.  If I could count on my favorite songs being available later it would make me less likely to think twice before renewing my Prime membership."

It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old (working) version of Amazon mp3, but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call.  It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless.  Let's be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service.  And I understand that and was OK with it.

(for the 4.3 update) ok... this app works perfect on my LG tablet so I would give it 5 stars if i just wanted to use it there but 99 percent of the time I want to use it on my phone... AN AMAZON FIRE PHONE!!!! and guess what? I can't install it on my amazon fire phone! This is similar to the way it worked on my iphone. This is the app I wanted. You click a song and it plays. SIMPLE. I dont want to add it to a library. There are too many songs I am curious to hear but may not want to hear ever again. This is a five star app but i cant install it on amazons fire phone... BACKUP YOUR FLAGSHIP PHONE, AMAZON!"

I also find it's complicated to download song. I have prime and wanted to take advantage of all its features,  why wouldn't i for 99 dollars a year. But its a bit too invasive.  I uninstalled it. Maybe if it didnt need to access so much i would of kept it. Back to Pandora i guess. Maybe next time Amazon thanks but no thanks. I felt violated."

This application doesn't appear to be associated with that, assuming its even true.  However, this application doesn't appear to do anything.  I can look up artists and albums, but there is no available option to purchase, play(not even a demo), or download the music."

12104,"Amazon",2015-04-30,3,"Needs Serious Work, Resource Hog from Cloud   I've tried this on both the iPod Touch (5th gen) and a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (n8013). The latter has a near top-of-the-line processor (still), 2gb of RAM, and over 96gb of memory (over 50gb always free). However, on both devices, the program hogs so much resources it often freezes and stalls when on Prime Stations - the main use I have for it. No matter how many background resources I free up, how high a priority I give this app to run on my systems, it has these problems on Prime Stations. Oh, and my internet is a 17mb/s system, so no lack of resources there either: I'd hate to try this on a 3 or 4g hookup. All too often, after a genre-station plays the first song/piece, the second buffers and *looks* like it's playing. But, the resources are so clogged that the *sound* is missing. Then when you try any of the controls to change songs or stations or genre, the app is non-responsive. And, shutting the app down won't free up your system, even force-closing it in the device's settings won't do it: you have to shut down and restart. Until Amazon programmers get this app in line with other music apps and reduces the resource grab, I wouldn't waste the effort using this. The *only* possible use for it is to preview singular songs/pieces (as long as they're free to Prime-members) to see if your interested enough in getting it somewhere you can add it to your collection in an app that runs better."

12121,"Amazon",2016-01-27,4,"What a terrific addition to Amazon Prime!   Amazon prime music released and as a paid and happy Pandora user, I was skeptical. Since I was already a Prime user as well, I gave Amazon a shot for a month. By the end of my personal test looking for music quality, variety and features like station streaming, I closed my Pandora account and haven't missed it much. While Pandora does a better job matching similar music in streaming stations, Amazon is on par in every other area I care about."

My wife and I saw him perform at a Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Golden, Colorado last year. We bought three of his CD's: (1) Come Ride With Me; (2) Twelve Mile Road; and (3) If Ihad a Horse. We both liked them so much that we ordered all his albums--but at the used prices; when you add in $3.99 shipping, the net cost of each album was less than the new one with Prime/free shipping."

12131,"Amazon",2015-04-14,4,"Amazon Prime Music streaming service has improved   Update: Apr 28, 2015:  My review went from 2 stars to 4 because with the latest feature additions.  They added stations.  Pick a genre and play music.  No stupid play list.  The android app still lacks artist search in the station area.I have tried to like Amazon Prime Music streaming service.  This is my second time since its original release.  But it just lacks common sense features that other streaming services provide.Pro: One very nice feature that stands out above the others is Amazon’s x-ray.  Lyrics display during a song.Con: Amazon Prime is hard to use.  Everything is centered on either an Artist or a Play-List.  Where others like Pandora, Spotify, and etc have something called a Station.  A station is similar genre music.Search for an Artist in Amazon, you get a list of Singles and Albums for that Artist.  Now what?  Play one song and search again?  I personally never want to listen to more than one song of a given Artist.  I want Random.You can make your own Play Lists.  But that is just too completed to listen to random music of a genre.  You can select a preexisting Play List.  There are some nice preexisting lists.  But after x songs are done, and then you have to select another list.Pandora is still the simplest to use."

And I don't want to have to go online whenever I want to listen to music from my computer.Amazon Prime Music is what it is, and nothing more. But it's not enough for me."
12138,"Amazon",2014-07-19,3,"If they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear   It's okay but only as a secondary music solution for you. First of all, I was super disappointed that ""free music"" really meant ""some free music"". The promotions and even the website make it seem like Prime members have access to full library for free. But then you start searching for songs and see all these price tags. It's super confusing until you realize you only have access to an oddball conglomeration of tunes. Their categories are horrible. I mean, when I see Pop as a category I think it's going to be today's pop music - not Pop songs from decades past. There's no ""today's hits"" section, top 40, or anything like that. And don't get me started on the weird music collections they've assembled. Who are these people who put together playlists? Absolute rubbish. All that aside, if you want to hear some old Journey or AC/DC album in its entirety, you can do that, so there is some value to the service, although if they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. You could totally survive without this mediocre service."
12141,"Amazon",2015-02-10,1,"The worst app ever!   Terrible app. The old Amazon app was much better. Difficult to check device before purchasing music to determine if I already own the song. Many songs purchased through Amazon do not indicate that it is already In Library resulting in purchasing the song twice.  Lately, songs purchased through the app appear in the app as on the device but not when using the Android Music Player.  I can only play newly purchased songs on the Amazon player which has a habit of locking up the phone when used with my Strava running app.  To unlock the phone I have to pull the battery.  All in all a terrible app."
12142,"Amazon",2014-09-09,2,"Not Impressed!  Needs VAST improvements!   First - I have a Galaxy 3 and use the android app.  The previous Amazon MP3 music app wasn't the best.  I had to turn it off by putting the screen on the song and clearing the queue, but once I figured that out, it was an okay app.  The new app that includes Prime is much worse.  It will not shut off at all!  I have to go to settings and sign out for it to stop running; therefore, I have to log in every time I want to use this app.  Also the free music is full of tribute bands.  Really Amazon?  I'm starting to think that the only thing good about Prime is the two day shipping.  My kindle only allows borrowing once a month, and it doesn't take that long to read a book.  I am NOT impressed Amazon!"

12152,"Amazon",2015-04-25,1,"Not good enough for me since they could not tell me ...   My complaint with this app is that once you launch the app there is no clear way to stop/exit/quit. I contacted their tech support about this issue and they claim that if you pause the app for long enough period of time it will eventually close. Not good enough for me since they could not tell me how much data it continues to suck up during that ""eventually"" time period. The best way to insure that it stops is go to the app manager and force stop. I just decided that was too much trouble and uninstalled."

12158,"Amazon",2014-08-04,5,"Wonderful edition to Prime!!!  Wonderful music app!!!  Such an unexpected value!   Love this music app!  I am a lover of many different genres of music.  From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc.  I previously used Pandora and I ¢¾ Radio.  Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better!  I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping.  It was well worth it.  As a whim, I decided to try the music app.  I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love!  I was quickly creating my own playlist.  I have created quite a library with so many different types of music.  I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone.  I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy.  I find all of the process easy.  The only warning is some songs that are free are ""rerecorded"" so watch for that and play samples before purchasing.  Those songs are the minority, but can happen.  If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library.  It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews.  I haven't shared their experiences at all.  Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc.  I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app!  I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim.  Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music.  I simply search for artist and songs.  Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love.  I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also.  I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free.  So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices.  This is a great gift in itself.  I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."

I guess it is what it is....."
12173,"Amazon",2017-04-19,3,"Too cumbersome of an App.   Takes up too much space in phone storage and uses up too much RaAM, cannot be shut down nor turned off neither. Kept crashing my phone even when it wasn't in use. Only thing good is that some music comes free with the App."
12174,"Amazon",2015-08-06,4,"Overall good   It's nice to have stations with no ads and unlimited skips. Sometimes it has trouble loading, and sometimes what's on the stations doesn't correspond well to the name. For example, Dire Straits radio plays very little Dire Straits. Overall, though, it's great. I love having offline access to the music from CDs that I bought in the past. That was a pleasant surprise."
12182,"Amazon",2017-09-01,1,"Absolutely horrible user interface and Widget is useless   I keep hoping that Amazon will get serious about their music offering but at this point I will not be renewing. The only positive thing is the integration with Echo. In Android, the interface is not user friendly. It's way too many clicks to get to your playlists and the ui is not intuitive. The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated. Other music services have widgets for direct playing of radio stations, playlists, etc. Amazon please play catch up and take this service seriously. I love Amazon but the music service applications are worthless and incredibly frustrating."

It's like Padora ON STEROIDS! What's not to like? New artists being added all the time, just released albums being added all the time...I love prime music. Got even better with my Echo Dot. I can change genres, advance songs, go to playlists just by asking Alexa."

I haven't experienced a repeated song in the radio stations, and new cool stations are suggested very often using the power of math. That's nice. The only issue is that I think that the library is not as huge as spotify which may be a problem if you look for specific songs very often."

12201,"Amazon",2015-09-05,3,"Needs a few simple but vital improvements   I like the fact that I get to listen to music comercial free with my Prime Membership but the app needs a few vital improvements to get a 5 star rating.  1.) When clicking thumbs down, I wish it gave the option to  permanently exclude the artist from my station.  I don't like Nickleback and I keep pressing thumbs down only to have another Nickleback song play later on.  2.)  When creating Playlists, I wish it the had the capability of slecting songs from your cloud library AND your offline library for the same playlist.  3.) My favorite station  never stays up top and sometimes I have to search for the station I was listening to an hour ago.  Can we ""favorite"" stations and create a list?  4.) When listening to stations, I often will hear the same songs over and over within an hour or two but yet songs I hit the tumbs up for could take days until I hear them again.  That's just baffling!"

However it no longer plays my offline music when not connected to the internet. This kind of defeats the purpose. Between this and all of the issues I have with prime shipping not actually delivering to my house since they insist on using surepost, I think its time to wean myself off Amazon. Kind of shame, it was a fantastic company, but they apparently are so busy doing new stuff that nobody is minding the day to day stuff."

I can't seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I'm listening to (not a huge loss there).  Navigation can be frustrating on a device.  The web interface is a bit better.  Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites.  That would help me a bit.  Also, how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order.  Kinda like a radio.  I'd love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music.** Updated on 11-14-2014The Android app has gotten very good (a new phone also helped).  I logged into the Windows desktop app last night and SURPRISE!!!!  Prime Stations!  How about adding that feature to the Android app?  I think that would be awesome!"

Where do you think this app would create its default download directory?  The local device of course. Well, just change the default download directory to the SD card and....oh wait a second, you can't. They don't permit this. So you buy their music and you can't store it on your SD card. Why do people buy SD cards in the first place? So they can store large files like photos, videos, and yes - MUSIC.  Good job Amazon, good job!"

They told me to logon to amazon and delete the music from there and try to re-download.That will actually permanently delete your music and you'll lose it forever.The app has no EQ so you'll have a less enjoyable music experience unless you play through another app."
12247,"Amazon",2014-06-16,2,"Waste until they let one use external storage   Good idea. But takes all your memory if you download to listen without streaming. Amazon let us use SD storage for the music, otherwise it's a waste to have this app."

Last solution was to upgrade to version 4.6.2. Swing and miss. Now the player controls no longer display on my lock screen. Yet another undocumented feature.If you are.

You have to know exactly what you want to listen to. I don't understand why they don't incorporate an intuitive radio player that you can enter several artists into and then rate played songs to have it learn what to play, basically just like pandora. If they could do this I'd be all in. I will still use prime bc there are MANY other benefits and utilization's for it.If an amazon customer service person see's this, let me know if there is something like this available, bc I REALLY want to use it, the controls and interface (in browser) are just very non-intuitive, much like the rest of amazon's website."

Additionally, it's free with Prime, so unlike competitor's apps (Spotify), I'm not paying $9.99 a month for this.  That having been said...I use Spotify 90% of the time, and Amazon Prime Music the other 10%, largely only for music Spotify doesn't have.  It's all in the UX/UI:  The interface here leaves most things to be desired, and that's the whole ball game."

After that it can take another minute to actually play. I'm switching to Google play.Tried the uninstall reinstall route several times.

I'm loving the curated playlists and the music that is on them. In general there is a great selection of music in Prime.One piece of feedback... I can't do much more to interact with the playlists than rate a playlist overall. I listen to the playlists when I'm at work and have been finding that there are times where I'm liking the music so much I want to ""like"" or give some sort of feedback live. I've been using Periscope a lot lately and have been the digging the ability to tap little hearts during the live broadcasts. That would be pretty cool to do when I'm listening to Amazon Prime music and you could get more feedback on how people are liking the jams.Keep up the good stuff!

I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit.  Then came the support merry-go-round.  My first rep was difficult for me to understand, very slow to understand me and didn't seem knowledgeable which was understandable since he was in Africa.  After getting an American rep, I was no more successful.  I have received two, not one email welcoming me to Amazon Music, so I guess I had registered but still no clarity on the error message. i QUIT.  Too bad Amazon didn't provide the ease of use that they have with Prime video."
12301,"Amazon",2014-11-05,4,"Works   It's a nice app, but it has a few bugs. I accidentally downloaded a very large play list form the cloud filling up my tablets storage. Seems there should be a ""do you really want to do this"" window before starting the download.At first this app didn't work with my new Dell Tablet. After several calls to Amazon the problem was solved. I bought the Tablet form Amazon so this problem should of been solved before hand."
12303,"Amazon",2015-02-02,4,"Seems good, but some major artists missing (like UNKNOWN HINSON)   Have not tried downloading or cloud playing, but the streaming music is high quality and has some advantages over Pandora... Namely being able to listen to full albums and playlists of individual artists without forced ""variety"". Biggest issue so far- NO UNKNOWN HINSON! Seriously... UNKNOWN HINSON is the KING of Country and Western Troubadors (doubt it? Google it!). How can they even have country music on here and not include the King?! I am sure other artists are missing as well, but it is imperative to include Unknown! Squeaking by on Hank III, even though the edited versions of his songs come up first. It is cool that censored and uncensored versions are available... As a parent, I like that. Battery usage seems comparable to Pandora. No ads (yay)! Just started using this today... So far pretty good. But, seriously- ADD UNKNOWN HINSON! Then this would be great!"
12306,"Amazon",2014-12-01,2,"Like the service, Android App rather disappointing   Like the prime service over all, but rather disappointed in not being able to store music on the SD Card. Really have trouble believing that this use case wasn't brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common.  I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card (world readable, 777 all that) is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music (I'm guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there).  All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method won't last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see What's on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."
12308,"Amazon",2014-03-25,1,"This thing is awful   I used to use this app a lot. I even spent the 25 bucks to get the expanded Amazon cloud storage and I have uploaded most of my music collection to my Amazon cloud account.  In the old days I could access any song in my collection with a tap on the screen and instantly be enjoying my music.Life was so carefree back then. Then one day THE UPDATE came. Now this app is a wasteland, destroyed by code. It might play a song if I tap on it, but most likely it isn't going to. You can try to play other songs but they probably aren't going to play either. And you know those songs you have saved on your SD card... well they might as well not exist anymore if you're stuck using this app. I hate this app with an unhealthy passion. I think it's mostly because I feel like I've been betrayed by something I once loved.I did find a work around to these problems. I bought an ipod classic. It doesn't hold all my music, but it holds a lot, it doesn't need wi-fi and best of all it plays music when I want to listen to it, not when it feels like it.  Next year I'll save 25 bucks by not renewing my Amazon cloud account. So I've got that going for me, which is nice."

We have an echo in several locations in our house, at work, and the app on our iPhones. All devices are unable to play any music if any one other device is using the service.

12319,"Amazon",2016-03-17,1,"Amazon Prime Music Streaming is Broken   Amazon's ability to stream music during peak hours when people are home is suspect. We have a fairly fast network, >6Mbps, and while playing music at home in the evenings the music plays, stops, plays, stops, ...etc.  During this time we tested the network and all other streaming apps and everything looked and worked perfect.Nothing else was running on our network except Amazon Prime Music. To stream music takes very little bandwidth compared to streaming an HD Movie.  This normally means a home network for playing music is rarely the problem and more likely to be something overloaded/broken in the providers network."

Having 1,000,000 songs available must mean you have to buy the other 100,000,000. I signed up for Amazon Prime because of the value added content of prime music, prime video, and prime books, one of which i can't even access and the other two of which add negligable value. I am not renewing my prime membership (you will have to call to do this as the day you can, buy there is nowhere to do this on there site.

I have been able to load some of my old music to my library and plan to add more. The selection is always growing. You can download the music to the device so you can play it when offline as well. I had no problem with the app on my Kindle Fire as others have reported. It is true the music from prime is only able to be played in the prime player but that has never been an issue for me.

A kicker for me is the offline music.  There is no way to import songs into Amazon Music.  It ""scans"" using settings you configured in ""Preferences"".  It refuses to add any songs from my home NAS.  Some features are OK, like any purchased music immediately show up in the online library.  But the rest of the functionality totally sucks."

It is easy to make a playlist, find a song, play a song, buy a song, or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's.  I love it!I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.Somebody had complained that you couldn't make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud.  While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.  Amazon: PLEASE ADD!!  I have purchased (yes, I paid money) another book reader, Ambling BookPlayer, for this feature alone. I would love to have it all in one central location.Otherwise, this is great especially with it being tied into the Amazon Cloud storage services.  Just awesome!"

There is not a lot of choice of music-especially for those who prefer niche artists rather than main stream pop. Even though Amazon basically invented the recommendation algorithm, its music recommendations fall very short from what Deezer providers. I bought Amazon Prime specifically for deliveries of Amazon purchases and have given Amazon Music a chance. But Ive now resubscribed to Deezer."
12417,"Amazon",2011-08-24,5,"Best of the Best   I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says ""Free for a limited time ..."" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have a unlimited data plan)."
12418,"Amazon",2016-10-06,5,"This works!   I like it, especially as an alternative to itunes.It took me a while but I finally migrated all my apple music over.Now I can listen to my cloud library or prime music in the car with very little data usage."

I never was too pleased with iTunes, this is a bit better IMHO.I have about 7,600 songs in my library.  I've downloaded about half to my phone.  When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs.  This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application.  For example - if you're playing a song, you can't add it to a playlist from that point."

12439,"Amazon",2012-04-25,2,"I want to like it... but   I have to say the program on my Droid 2 is sluggish and locks up occasionally.  Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.  Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists.  There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I don't miss anything.  And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch (yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything.  It's a chore and takes a long time.)  Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres:  I'm a nut about tagging my music.  I will tag my music separating the tag with a "";"" for each tag.  Amazon doesn't recognize this and now I have 736 different Genres.  Useless.Pluses:  You can buy music on Amazon and it's there ready to stream on the app immediately.  If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything (and I mean a lot) in my music library."
12446,"Amazon",2014-08-06,3,"its good value, along with the TV/Video/Shipping etc   Ok. So far, for the value, as a student account getting this for $5 a month, its  good value, along with the TV/Video/Shipping etc...HOWEVER, I am thoroughly unimpressed with the overall quality of the music streamed from the cloud. There is NO EQ that I can find, and not control over bit quality for those wanting less or more quality. It shows duplicates in the lists. It showed Joe Satriani under Steve Vai's artist filter. There is a fair amount of choice. There is no way to share or auto post ""What I am listening to""  to FB, or Google+ or Twitter. There are no skins or way to get a smaller compact player. The one option is not much of an option and still too big, and lacking basic info. There is potential here, but as it stands I can get my music by other means once I am no longer in school."

If it has to do with piracy then you should know that anyone who wants to illegally download content can do it with ease and by not enabling your store on the international stage you are only hurting yourselves.  If you considered making purchases available in other countries you would be making alot more money in those markets than you are now (nothing).  Guess I'll stick to buying from Itunes."

12510,"Amazon",2014-08-08,3,"Lack of major feature, and a very annoying bug, but functional.   Been using this since Amazon Cloud Player, and the new updates are less than thrilling.As another reviewer pointed out, you can't make and save playlists to cloud. I run amazon music on my laptop and phone, and playlists have to be made separately for each device.More annoying still is that imported mp3s to my phone are being made into weird albums. Any album with more than one artist contributing (soundtracks for instance) are separated into as many ""albums"" as there are artists in said album. This is ridiculous. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be any manual way to fix it.Aside from these two major irritations, the app functions as advertised. Otherwise I would rate it lower."
12514,"Amazon",2013-11-22,3,"Support for SD Cards please   if I could save music downloaded from the amazon cloud onto my 64 gb SD card this would be a five star review.

12519,"Amazon",2012-09-12,2,"Unable to save music to SD Card   The inability of this app to save downloaded music to my external SD card earns it a two star deduction. That's kinda the whole point of me getting an SD card. I have awful signal at work, so I can't use streaming, and the SD card issue really limits the amount of music I can download to my device. I really like most of the rest of the app, but that simple limitation makes it really hard to love the app in total."

12540,"Amazon",2011-04-15,4,"Before You Scream, Click on AmazonCloudplayer Logo!   I have a new Droid X, & I have been kind of cranky because, one, I'm not that familiar with the phone, & two, trying to figure out this app was just making me nuts. After 3 or 4 days, I was much more familiar with the phone. I discovered, by accident, that some things opened under my finger that I didn't think were ""touch"" spots. Who knew?Once I figured that out, I started touching more of the icons and words in the Amazon MP3 Cloudplayer window, which opened things I didn't expect  to open. There's no *PING* light bulb over my head, by any means. But it was a valuable experience.I can't say that it's terribly intuitive; it's not. It just takes messing around with this app to get more familiar with it - the more you use it, the more things you discover.In fact, right now I am listening to a song by Billy Joel. But when I was trying to show my daughter how this player system works, it wouldn't do exactly what I wanted, the way I thought it would. Poo.After years of iTunes, it's just going to be a matter of learning a new system. I just hope Cloudplayer is more reliable about maintaining the catalogue of songs I've purchased through this app - so I can download them again in case of catastrophe. iTunes really completely failed to do that, despite their reassurances all your purchased music could be retrieved. I just hope Amazon's Cloudplayer system actually works in that respect. Hopefully I'll never have to find out.Now, I'm going to figure out how to get music from my MacBook Pro's iTunes to migrate to my Droid X, and into Cloudplayer. (If you hear screaming, it's just me, but I'll tap something that looks suspicious, & maybe that will do the trick. At least that's my evil plan...)"

12544,"Amazon",2012-12-30,4,"My choice from the three contenders   Choosing the right ""cloud"" solution for my music collection was a journey of trial and error. The complication arose out of my cross platform use.  I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go.  If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store.  I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device.  The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.

I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download it(purchase it with credit) and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. 4 stars all the way,would have given it 5 if it was compatible with my tablet.

If you click OK you may get another error, unless signal is back again. If I am driving I just want it to work again so won't stop, press the contact button and write a message!

12609,"Amazon",2015-07-14,4,"I like it.   I think Amazon Music is great as it is included with Prime Membership. There are so many free songs you can download, especially the old rock classics. I do find the format difficult to navigate which gets frustrating.  I wish you could download to the cloud and your device at the same time. I hate having to download the song to the cloud and then download it to my device also. Especially if I am downloading lots of songs. It takes sooooo long.  Once, all of my songs disappeared from my Kindle and I had to download all of them again. Not fun. Since it is included with my Prime membership, I really can't complain too much."

It won't let you download to your SD card, the whole app is clunky, etc. On the whole I don't use it much.Recently I hit my data limit. This usually isn't a problem for me. So I checked my data history and surprise, surprise, Amazon  Music decided it needed to do something so critical that it used about half of my data plan in the course of one day (465Mb?!). I actually need that data to do other things, like GPS navigate.No thanks. I've disabled the app. There are much better ways to get music onto my phone"

12626,"Amazon",2017-02-11,1,"The latest version absolutely sucks   Takes forever to load (sometimes as long as 20 minutes).

At last count, I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for - even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them.

There was over 50 different album arts downloaded, most of which I never purchased and some was offensive. I don't know if this was a fluke or not but the way to see is  plug your phone into your computer, (make sure the USB connect is on Disc Drive on your phone) open up either drive E or F and look in amazon.mp3 and then look in a folder called image.pics or something similar, and look at all the .jpeg files ( you can safely delete the .jpeg files without screwing you phone/computer up).I like Amazon as a whole, but this in not right and we as buyers should be able to decide what we want on our devices, not someone else.This would be the perfect music player, except for this one flaw, so one star as I did not download any music with offensive album art.As always, with ANYTHING on a hard drive or something similar , do this at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you screw your device(s) up."

I get lots of cryptic error messages. There is no public API. There is no support. Amazon seems to be doing everything it can to hide how buggy their service is. The file tagging and upload interface is at best a proof of concept thrown together by some students... Adobe Air? Really? Most of my album artwork is completely wrong... I have a number of albums whose matched artwork is not only incorrect but offensive. Wouldn't it be nice if I could upload my own artwork without uploading all my music again?

Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F."

So, the small MP3 player I just purchased on the Amazon website to use while I am running, the MP3 player that just plays music files and doesn't load apps, the MP3 player that I will now be returning to Amazon, is totally useless.

YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY PRIME MUSIC FILES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER. So, really not sure why they are calling these songs you can't download ""Prime music"", certainly makes it seem as though you as a ""Prime member"" would have access is a bunch of crap. I guess they are trying to justify the $99.00 a year fee they charge by giving you what amounts to another Pandora or Spotify. What a waste of time, and now I have an app I have to uninstall as well or maybe I should just run with my Kindle strapped to the side of my head."

There is a limitation to the Android operation system that doesn't allow widgets if it is on your SD card.  After doing this I was able to use the widget once again.  I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have.

The only problem I encountered is that I downloaded so many songs that I ran out of memory on my phone and had to delete some.  They are, however, still in my library in the cloud.  I enjoy the recommendations that are listed based on the music I am listening too.  As a result I have found artists I would not have looked into otherwise.  I highly recommend the service!!!"

I KNOW that Amazon wants us enslaved to their cloud, but the reality is that Internet connections are not as reliable as Amazon believes. Could this be because Amazon lives in a wired city? See, I live in Portland, OR and we are very wired, too. HOWEVER, crap happens and with the Amazon Music app, you either download EACH album individually, which is tedious if you already have a large music library, OR you suck it up, Buttercup, and use the cloud. When is Amazon finally going to tell their sweatshop developers to have a ""Download All"" option in the app so that those of us who want to listen regardless of our ISP's current availability?!I'm sorry, but this is about as user-antagonistic an app as I've seen in a VERY long time, and I'm specifically talking about the new player, not some old one."

I like to listen while working, but won't ever be able to listen to Amazon music cause the MP3 player is CRAP! CRAP CRAP CRAP! Worthless for a player that quits when the device screen goes dark.

Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they aren't close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that's why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: don't bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I didn't want. Don't know why, but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that  weren't even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all..

Somehow, Amazon made a mobile app that's worse than the stupid desktop mp3 downloader.I still can't fathom why every company that sells music needs to have their own stupid player. I guess their marketing folks are happy to lose users just to get more stalking info and push their products harder."

Total BS imo.This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I'll be here another half an hour.Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a) the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b) when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can't minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can't close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I'm looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer.

13357,"Amazon",2016-09-04,1,"One Star   bunch of crap!"
13362,"Amazon",2014-08-03,3,"why restricted to certain devices?   Cool on my desk top - especially how it has put all former CD purchases into M3 library - but won't work on BlackBerry. Why not? I'm not involved in the Amazon/Apple wars."
13366,"Amazon",2017-08-21,4,"Decent app   It's ok. It's annoying that it stops playing music after a while. Better than paying $5 a month for Pandora though"

13409,"Amazon",2012-07-05,4,"good, but could be great   I love this app, its a wonderful player, works just like play music on nexus  s and even works with headset and native lock screen controls. I would like the ability to upload to my cloud player from in app though so that I could easily share playlists between multiple devices."

13434,"Amazon",2012-08-24,2,"Great until charged for streaming.   Was great when they let you upload your own music and stream it anywhere for free. It became the place I'd look to first for buying new music so I'd have it right there with my other stuff. But not charging for that makes the whole thing kinda.... meh?"
13441,"Amazon",2014-07-11,1,"data hog rip off...   Tried using app bit it would not read the music on my device. Switched to another app and it ran in the background sucking up 3gb + data."
13443,"Amazon",2011-05-16,1,"Awful for exercising   I was very excited about this because I thought how great I can exercise taking just my phone instead of my phone and iPod. I must say it works great on WiFi but I was having issues with it running on 3G. I looked in the help section and found where I needed to call Sprint. They updated my phone and it started working great at my house. I went out tonight with just my phone, switched on the exercise trainer and 3G data. It worked great until I got two blocks away from my house and stopped working. I couldn't get it to work again. I called my husband to put my iPod on his car tire so I could have some music to walk to. I was raving about it to two other friends who have EVOs but now I'm going to tell them not to even bother because it only works over WiFi. Completely useless for my needs. HTC EVO 4g"

13455,"Amazon",2011-05-15,4,"Music Buying Purposes Only   I don't use the cloud or media player, simply because they're terrible. Amazon mp3 has made me start buying music again, which in itself is a great feat. Buying is simple, which makes compulsive purchases almost too easy. I often find myself thinking ""It's only $5. I won't miss it."""
13462,"Amazon",2012-01-29,4,"Waiting for A/V receiver support   Overall, a great app for phones and tablets, but when will Amazon MP3 be supported by A/V receivers similar to Napster, Rhapsody, and Pandora???  In the absence of streaming audio from Amazon MP3, it seems Apple's airplay has a lock on the home theatre market."

13541,"Amazon",2012-08-21,4,"great, but...   The blackberry version was just a tad better. You could save songs you're interested in to purchase later, and new songs/albums were easier to view. Still love the deals though!"
13545,"Amazon",2011-09-19,5,"works great on lg lx2   the app works as it should. although I wish it would allow changing default storage locations.  however the music selection and the fact that music cost less than competitive services make up for.any shortcomings."

13570,"Amazon",2011-04-09,5,"Awesome with Cloudplayer   With cloudplayer this program is great.  It allows you to listen to your huge music library without taking up a ton of storage and dominates the need for me to carry around my ipod."

13587,"Amazon",2012-09-25,1,"Way Too Much Memory Usage   This app uses over 20MB of main memory and can not be moved to the SD card.  Amazon needs to reduce memory usage 80-90% as my memory is now full."
13590,"Amazon",2011-04-18,5,"This is what ive been waiting for   I am impressed with this app.  sinking my music has become a chore when I moved away from an iOS device.  Now don even worry about it.  Last pretty long on the subway too"
13593,"Amazon",2014-10-23,5,"AWESOME!   Love Amazon Music with Prime. So far I have found all the music I have searched for, and the best part is that I have gotten it all for free with my Prime membership. Thanks Prime!"

13613,"Amazon",2011-03-27,4,"Music on the go   This is a great app for buying music on the go. There are times when I hear a song on the radio or on the Internet and I just have to have it. This is the only app I use to get that music."

13633,"Amazon",2011-07-25,4,"Wth?   Why can I not download individual songs to a device? It's needlessly tedious that I must download whole playlists or albums st a time. Would rate five stars otherwise"
13635,"Amazon",2011-04-05,4,"very easy way to buy music   I love this app. The deals of the day are great & you can get bestselling albums for only  $3.99. The search feature works great and tou can preview song before buying it."

13639,"Amazon",2011-03-31,2,"Portrait mode needs overhaul   This has potential but simply ui elements are overlooked.  Portrait mode is almost impossible to navigate thru my library as it only gives two lines of songs, albums, etc."
13641,"Amazon",2011-03-31,5,"Simple but useful   I have used a lot of music apps out there, and while i might miss their more advanced features, this one delivers an entire music ecosystem!  I love It!"

13652,"Amazon",2011-04-01,4,"Works great!   Uploaded to the cloud and streamed yesterday during a 4 hour trip. Not one single dropout or glitch. Another great Amazon product. Thanks for getting this to market!"
13653,"Amazon",2012-04-04,1,"Frozen and stuck on nothing   Its like listening to music in your car going over multiple speed bumps. It skips and you have to reboot your phone all the time"
13658,"Amazon",2011-08-01,4,"One of my favorite apps   I use this quite often. It's fast and easy. It has forceclosed several times but after the last couple of updates I haven't had any problems."
13659,"Amazon",2011-04-01,3,"Screen lock   I like it. Would be nice to have a quicker interface with screen lock, though, instead of having to go to the widget each time. Makes it easier when working out."
13661,"Amazon",2011-03-29,5,"Great app   would recomend this app to everyone, used to used doubletwist and loved it. wish they would do the same unlock screen as it. maybe they can buy out doubletwist!"

13683,"Amazon",2011-03-29,4,"Cannot listen without WiFi   App is great app. But I can't listen cloud music with 3G/4G. Cloud playing works only with WiFi on my HTC EVO. That's odd and needs to be fixed."
13685,"Amazon",2013-03-01,1,"Why do they update and make them stop working?   I used to love using this app. It was quick, easy to use, and I could download songs anywhere......then they updated it......now i can't download anything unless I am connected to wifi, but in that case, why not just use my computer?

13703,"Amazon",2011-06-18,5,"Best of the current batch   works as described on my DROID x. beware, if u don't have unlimited data, this app lives and dies on data.  it will easily eat 100MB of data every hour.  I do wish that it would buffer at least 30sec ahead for when my 3G is spotty."

13732,"Amazon",2014-08-07,1,"Poor boarding on  monopoly   Zero stars  only gave it one to get II in the system. get over your issues with Apple and make it compatable! You are missing 2/3rds of the market."
13739,"Amazon",2011-03-31,1,"Let me get rid of it!   This was preinstalled on my G2 and I can't uninstall. To add insult to injury, after I force close it, it likes to start up on its own whenever the phone changes state. So it eats memory and battery... not cool."

13807,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-21,5,"radio worth listening to   What makes iHeart Radio worth while is that you can listen to regular radio stations, or you can creat your own station. I find myself listening to stations in other parts of the USA.  Creating your own personal station is what I like best about this app. so many stations only play what they are dictated to play, it is nice to listen to stations where the music is understandable. If you like music, and are not happy with the local stations, this is the app for you."

I have to tell you, I was very surprised at the amount of stations associated with the network and the quality of the audio.  I'm going to purchase a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker and now I can stream radio stations to it as well because of the app.  And, it was free, so how can you go wrong?"

Unfortunately, it tends to be Amazon that falls short of the mark. For those of you with Kindle Fire that might be interested in Google Play apps, I would suggest finding out how to ""sideload"" the apps. It's not difficult, and it gives you another - and sometimes better - app source."

I made a station for Daft Punk and I only got daft every 3rd or 4th song. and the other songs that it play were crudy techie music. if they fix this I will give a five star rating."

It's really easy to use and stays playing while you move on to other apps. One suggestion would be a rating system for likes and dislikes instead of thumbs up to be more intuitive. Great app that I use daily."

Be aware that if the station has advertising, you will be listening to it, too. It is only remotely similar to Pandora, which is where you create your own stations. That may be a possibility on this app. But for now, I enjoy the stations I have chosen and saved. Enjoy!"

I like Pandora as a source of music online, but IHeart Radio has more variety and a better catalog of big band, jazz and standards. I would have given IHeart a ""5,"" but sometimes it is a little slow in identifying the current selection, and occasionally doesn't identify it at all. Other than that, it's a ""5."""

It offers the opportunity to listen to radios stations across the States, so that was my main interest.But it's not user-friendly for the novice. I will change my rating once I've tried this out a little longer."

Lots of of other local stations are available as well, whereas in other apps I've used they frequently just switch you to something ""similar""."

It is a great streaming music app. Nice grafics, you can add artist that I would not imagine that they would have, I like Native American Flute music and I was able to add all of my favorite artist, also nice selection in New Age Music.

14363,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-23,5,"Love this!   Way better than Pandora in my opinion. I love that you can listen to any radio station or create your own.The only con I can think of is the skip limit but I just switch stations (I made a few stations of the same type of music for this purpose) to bypass the not letting you skip thing."
14364,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-20,5,"🎶LOVE IT!!🎶   I like thats it gives you lots of channels and artists to chose from and I think its cool that you made it so you can listen to music when your playing games or other stuff, thanks for making 💜 😄"

14383,"iHeartRadio",2015-09-16,4,"Overall its great but Missing one Feature.   The app is missing one Feature almost all of the other apps in have that is being able to see your listen  history. All of the songs you've heard while listening to a created station"
14387,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-10,5,"A must have app   This app is a must have. Don't be fooled by negative reviews of this app. I live in Miami, FL but was able to tune stations in Chicago IL, Terre Haute IN and here in Miami. The app is beyound my expectations. I grateful for the developers of this app.The app meets my expectations. It deserves more than five starssss."

14429,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-03,5,"Amazing App!   I love the sleep music timer on the app. Every night I'll set it for an hour, and every song I hear stays within the genre of music I like. Also, when people think that me listening to the radio is obnoxious, I can just listen to stations with my headphones in. This is so much better than Pandora!"
14435,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-07,2,"I do not see the point in a radio app that requires internet,when you ca get Prime Music and play with no internet needed   I only had this app in for a short time, it is hard to figure out. I prefer goingto the Amazon Prime musicstore, and getting my music from there. If you get the music from Prime Music you can play it anywhere you go, no need for internet ."

14452,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-19,4,"Overall great, but could use some enhancements.   I love this streaming app because of the lack of of obtrusive ads, but I only wish they would let us skip more on a channel or in a day.  Sometimes it's pretty bad at predicting what I want to hear, but overall it's a great app."

14469,"iHeartRadio",2016-09-05,1,"Incompatible on all devices?   When this app disappeared off of my Kindle I went to investigate.  It is currently unavailable for all of my devices from the original Fire gen 1 through the Kindle Fire HD8."
14473,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-08,5,"I love this app!   I downloaded this app thinking it was going to be like mix-zing (another app) but this was way better, you can listen to the radio all day and you don't have a limited number of time.If I had to pay I'd definitely pay whatever it asked me to, it really is worth downloading."

14491,"iHeartRadio",2015-10-29,1,"Missing the stations I wanted.   It does not have the specific stations I hoped for.  NYC 1010Wins news is not there.  Also I could not figure out how to get the Mets World series ratio broadcasts."
14497,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-25,2,"Two Stars   The stations really aren't true to their title.  For example, several ""instrumental"" stations have vocals rather than all-instrumental."

14506,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-09,2,"Not as good as Pandora   Just a large corporate attempt to clone there version of Start Up Pandora. Canned music with their spin. When the came into the Charlotte area and purchased most of the radio stations the music they offered was limited and very commercial. Gone forever Independent Radio.

14550,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-30,2,"Weak   It might play one song of the artist you want to hear on your station.  Then 45 min to an hour later, another.  Even Pandora plays the selected artist more.Possibly the tablet its loaded on but it freezes up more than few times.  No freezing up issues with Pandora.Less adds though."

19333,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-17,4,"Good Clean Reception   I was looking for an app that could deliver streamed radio from various locations.  I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type.  I've found stations through the internet on my home computer, but wasn't able to enjoy it at work.  Enter iHeart.  At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem.  Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference.  The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I don't mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is when I am traveling, the buffer isn't large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you're driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."

25244,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-12,3,"Better than...   Pandora.  At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition.  While it's great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you wouldn't hear the same stuff within the first half-hour.  Overall? It's a keeper for me for now.  BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes (or at all) unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I'm all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can't find a genre to suit your mood, you're just not looking."
25247,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-19,4,"good but not great   I love everything about Iheart but l like to listen to the whole song before I like or dislike the song. Iheart thinks that people like me do not exist so you can not go back to the song you just listened to and like or dislike it. You have to wait for the song to come up again or pray it doesn't and never have to hear it again.  If you don't like or dislike Iheart thinks you liked it or something like that, but everything else is perfect. I would not change anything else about it if you like music, radio, or lyrics strung along in a catchy tone this is the app for you."

25261,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-04,5,"Less cormecials   Soo far am loving it , less iteration I being with Pandora's for a big while the only thing I use too get frustrated with the iterations here I don't get that, also you guys don't played the same songs over and over!"
25265,"iHeartRadio",2011-11-19,5,"great free product   Love it!! I don't have to stay on one room to listen in a room, it. Goes where I go"

25268,"iHeartRadio",2016-09-26,1,"Barely Working   It often has a lot of trouble connecting to streams. For example, only 2 of my local stations will even connect. All of them did at first, then they stopped. I contacted the developer and they told me this was a known problem( I'm using a Kindle Fire 7"" 5th generation) and will be fixed in a future update. They haven't done so yet...."
25272,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-02,1,"Doesn't work on new kindle fire HD   Loaded this app, accidentally tapped on a station, then not able to select stations.  Doesn't even play the station selected.  Try to open app and it just flashes for 1/4 sec and disappears.  Deleting app."
25275,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-21,5,"I love this app!   I heart radio is an awesome app. You can listen to live radio as well as create your own stations (like Pandora.) It features a sleep timer if you like to listen to music before bed, and an alarm to wake up to. However, if you are like me the music isn't enough to wake me up. You don't even have to be in the app to listen to the music. It is also good for finding new stations. It is completely free, and it's not required to sign in. If you love music as much as I do you should get this app."
25276,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-10,5,"wonderful   I love this app it's great and has all my favorites. I can listen to 80's, hits, country , anything I want. And unlike Pandora no commercials unless it's live radio lol and u pick what u like."
25278,"iHeartRadio",2017-03-15,5,"I love the music choices.   I like that I can pick out an artist and hear otrher artists from the same genre that I might not have thought about wanting to hear. I think there is more variety in music from a station I have selected than other apps."

25285,"iHeartRadio",2017-05-10,2,"Would not connect half the time   Selected stations outside of my market area and it just sat there and spun, but didn't connect.  I will try again, but Amazon music is better."
25288,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,5,"So much better then Pandora.   Its so much better then Pandora cause it gets what you want to listen to.It pays attention to the music you like.In Pandora you give a song a thumbs down but it plays the same song or artist over and over again.iHeartRadio gives you more variety to most familiar to least familiar.its awesome.When this review says Bree Fontinilla that's my mum.I'm her daughter writing this review.Zoe Kemp.Also known as Zoe Horan - Styles.Youtube channel- ZoeHoran1213.Plez subscribe to me.I haven't made any videos yet."

25293,"iHeartRadio",2016-10-29,1,"Many Problems For Me   I want to listen to a bands radio station but half the time I get songs from a different band. Also when I went to make my own station I though I got to choose the songs but if I click a song it adds that whole songs station with other music that's not that song. I like spotify better"
25295,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-29,4,"4.5 out of 5 stars for iHeart Radio   Overall a good app. It's got good songs and bands and is good if you like certain bands but don't want to actually buy the CD. The only complaint I have is that you have a moment ad to how many songs you can skip in a playlist a day. Also you can't add individual songs to your playlist. But a good app. I enjoy it."
25299,"iHeartRadio",2016-09-27,1,"Used to work   It's broken, deleted and reloaded over three times.  The only thing that plays are podcasts.  Same problem on my cell."

Plus my station want load I try and try don't download if u do it works at the beginning but then it messes up and didn't load and if it does your station will not load."
25303,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-20,5,"Music to my ears   I love it, I use it on my kindle and play music while im at work. keeps me going and my day goes by fast, I have access to my favorite stations when ever I want!"
25305,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-01,1,"Unhappy and I'm annoyed   Right after I downloaded it I deleted it because it skipped and you have to have an Internet connection to listen. I had heard that it was a good app but it is not worth getting. I also had a hard time using the app. I would much rather continue using Pandora and VeVo like I usually do. I reccomend that you don't get this app."
25306,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-26,2,"Just Wasn't For Me   I thought I could like this app but just couldn't take the time too. Some people might think its awesome and that's okay."
25312,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-30,4,"worth it!   I live outside the US so I can't create an account or save any stations so it loses a star for that, BUT I can still listen to my favorite stations from home and that is great! It's nice to hear new music and not be stuck with all the same songs on my ipod (you do get sick of them after awhile!) I also enjoy hearing the personalities I recognize and listening to news from home. Of all the apps I've purchased, this is one I use everyday!"
25317,"iHeartRadio",2014-11-17,1,"never   People lied to me, said I could use this app without singing in to Facebook or e-mail, well I tried and all I could get to work was 2 radio stations, I don't like either, so I deleted the app. I get much better with Pandora even with commercials. This app sucks,making you have to sing up for music I don't even like."
25320,"iHeartRadio",2017-03-25,5,"Awesome   Awesome music that you choose to listen too.You listen to your your favorites.."
25323,"iHeartRadio",2016-10-03,1,"Can someone help me?   I was trying to connect my Alexa with IHeart Radio, but I don't know how."

25332,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-22,5,"Five Stars   I love free radio. It has a great selection of songs and stations to listen to."
25341,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-23,2,"What happened to it?   at first I loved it but now I hats it because I can create new stations and I tried everything to fix it but I wont work! it always says ""oops we don't have enough songs to make a station""  or what ever so now I have to listen to stations i created a while ago and I want different ones now I cant even listen to radio stations that I haven't already played"
25346,"iHeartRadio",2012-07-10,1,"i loved this app so much but then i updated it and it sucks butt through a straw   its just like Pandora u get like 8 skip a songs but after that u got to wait u no ok cause they play good songs but listen to me k DO NOT UPDATE IT DO NOT UPDATE because when u do I only get 6 skips for the hole day and its sucks butt so plz don't and it dissent need facenook the other ppl  are lying"
25347,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-22,5,"Yay!   So glad I can listen to a couple of my favorite stations and they come in clear as a bell!!  I live in the hills, and get horrible reception, and am very happy that iHeartRadio is around.  I wish more stations would be affiliated, but possibly Clear Channel won't integrate the system... Anyways, It's very good and I highly recommend it, and it's free!"
25351,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,1,"The Kindle app is a bit frustrating   I have this on my phone and I don't have problems. I like to use it on my Kindle too, but once it is launched and playing I cannot get the app back up. Music plays but the screen is blank. At first I thought it was because I had used another app and tried to come back to it, which seemed logical if a bit 2009. However it doesn't really matter, once the music is started the only way for it to stop is when it times out or I shut my kindle all the way down. No liking or disliking songs, no changing stations, or even knowing who the current artist is. Is anyone having problems like this? I make do but I'd love an update to fix this.The good news is it is stuck on a custom station made from my favorite band. That's something at least."
25355,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-07,2,"Not as good as could be. But okay.   I have set up several of my own ""stations"" but have not been real happy with the repetitiveness of certain songs. Seems like it focuses on just a couple of the artist's songs and replays them fairly often without digging deeper into the catalog. I wish it had more features and that the streaming rate could be checked. Also, a record button would be nice."
25356,"iHeartRadio",2017-09-10,1,"One Star   app didn't work."
25358,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-25,5,"Best music app out there.   Not only does it have great music, but it has an alarm clock feature and a sleep timer. This is just a phenomenal app overall."
25362,"iHeartRadio",2017-02-19,1,"Help w/download   I have had this app before (from Google Playstore) but uninstalled to free up memory. I got this app (from amazon) last night and it is listed in cloud and shows 'downloading' I can't stop/cancel the download it's just spinning... I just wanted to listen to the radio on my android phone. Please help me?"

25377,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-19,5,"Great App and Free   I would recommend this App for people that don't want to pay through the nose for XM radio and listen to their favorite stations including those with political or religious views. I want to admit to you that you can use this App on any Android or iPhone device, but beware it also uses your minutes as well, well worth it. Right now I have it connected to two of my devices, the Android phone and my Amazon Fire."
25380,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-11,3,"can't figure out how to get this to do what I want   This app does let me have my primary talk format but no others. I'm sure there is a way to get there but I don't know what it is. It wants to connect through my faceboook which I won't allow so that may be why it does not work as I think it should."

25386,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-03,4,"best music app ever   I love this app, you can listen to free music and the music doesn't take up any space! All you need is an internet reception and an email or Facebook account. It is truly my favorite music app but there is one flaw sometimes I will try to listen to a song and it did the wrong one if you can fix this please do."
25389,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,4,"Good app   I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of sources from around the country and across formats. Would like to see more oldies stations (that don't consider the 80's to be the limit of oldies) but that's the service provider not the app."
25393,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-05,5,"Remarkable   I would recommend this app for any music lover. Everyone's life needs a soundtrack - make sure yours fits!"
25403,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-05,5,"awsome!!!   Hey when the other reviews are all have good ratings it's gotta be good. I mean they make it simple and easy to use. I found right off the bat 4 stations that are awesome and if I get sick of what's playing they have an option to mix it up even more. You just gotta get it ð"

25412,"iHeartRadio",2017-08-04,3,"Works overseas.   I live in Tanzania. None of the other U.S. music sites that I know of permit me to use them here. I Heart Radio does so that is great, but there are frequent pauses in their service. Maybe due to buffering?"

25422,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-31,2,"needs work...   I had this app on my kindle for a while, but it was somehow deleted. After I re installed it it had some problems. I could log in just fine, but whenever I pressed the menu bar to choose a station, the app would say that it's not responding and close."
25427,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-03,4,"good   Look it's really good, I mean it has a big selection of music. But it needs to fix some stuff, when I want to hear a certain group I should be able to listen to them without having some random group pop up. But in all it's a good app."
25429,"iHeartRadio",2012-01-23,5,"I Heart iHeartRadio   Come on, you knew I was going to say that, didn't you? Much like Pandora or slacker radio but with a few things that are special to just this little app. Great selection of stations."

25466,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-22,5,"A *must have* app for me   Of all the apps I have downloaded, I would have to say that ""iHeart Radio"" gets used the most. Being able to listen to so many different types of music while relaxing with my Kindle Fire is a true pleasure. I don't have a Facebook account and I still enjoy this app. I just tune in to the station I want to listen to, sit back and enjoy."

25630,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-03,4,"Four Stars   Great radio!"
25636,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-08,3,"Three Stars   ok"
25638,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,4,"Four Stars: Please read information below   Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there's no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it'll automatically choose songs or stations to play next. It'll also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can't like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can't save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist.  This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you don't like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that's the truth. I'm here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...There's nothing really to expose."
25639,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-24,1,"sucks!!!   I love music but when I get a song in my head, I want to hear that song. I dont mind hearing similar songs by the same or similar artists AFTER I hear the one I want.  I cant figure out how to do that. Then when I skip too many times it locks me out. I hate this app."
25644,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-01,1,"yawn   this app is one of my least favorite apps ever. it has none of the songs I like or stations. just tryed it. Pandora is better. dials there axway to remove my account?"

25650,"iHeartRadio",2012-04-30,1,"Requires F-book (Facebook)   Didn't even download, as soon as I saw it REQUIRED F-Book (Facebook).I don't care if they gave me $10,000 to download, if it involves F-Book, Forget it!!!"
25654,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app!   I love so many features about this app.  The custom radio stations one can build are excellent.  Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.  This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.  Thank you for making this available"

25673,"iHeartRadio",2012-04-23,1,"TIMELINE   This was a good app, unroll that. But they make you have timeline on Facebook! that's really not fair! I HATE TIMELINE!!!!!"
25675,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-08,1,"constant force close   App will not run on my fascinate without access to GPS and external storage. It is also very annoying that you can't bypass the sign in and location screens. Every time the app is launched you have to go through the process of declining. It would be nice to have a checkbox to not show up again. I will be uninstalling after this review."
25679,"iHeartRadio",2012-07-28,1,"terrible   this crashes everytime I try to play a station ill stick with Pandora not worth the download don't waste time"
25686,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-03,5,"love it   love it. it is easy to listen too and you can pick a radio station or make one i like this. everyone should try it."
25689,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-06,5,"Works for me   The times I have used iHeartRadio it was been awesome.  Love that you can pick an artist and make your own playlist.  Thank you for making the app."
25691,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-01,1,"I don't want to belimited to someone's preselected music   I loaded this thinking I could listen to more than the top xxx pieces of music. There is so much more but it wasn't made obvious how to get to other stations. If I have to slog to find what I want I take that as a clue I have taken the wrong direction. I removed this from my Kindle and the Cloud after a frustrating hour of trying to get it do what it implied."
25692,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-03,5,"awesome   this app is awesome because it plays what's on the radio if you don't have one. get this app asap."
25693,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-22,5,"Great radio for Kindle!   I love this app! The music is so great and the ability to make your own customized station is awesome. So glad this is a Kindle app!"
25696,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-07,4,"Haven't use   I actually have never used this, forgot I had it and don'tthink to try it while on the computer so I can't really leavea review."
25703,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-15,1,"Sucked a**   Kept freezing and never worked. I liked iheart on my phone but on the kindle it did not work it kept saying the program stopped working and would cut back to home. So stupid this would be why I like pandora more"
25706,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-29,4,"Great app with one exception   Wonderful station, with one exception that I'll get to in a bit.Lots of stations from my local area stations to decade specific genre stations.  I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore.  Very few ads really, just occasionally when I change stations.  Limited number of skips available per day, but meh, just change the station if you really can't stand that song.Now for the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  This is an older version 5.  The newer version 7 allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated.  This version is buggy or it just doesn't work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire.  The version 7 app from Google Play loads fine on my tablet and smartphone for that station, just not this version for Kindle Fire."
25711,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-23,1,"Didn't have any use for it...   To be completely honest, I downloaded this free app to get the coins that came with it.  I didn't even try it out."
25713,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-24,5,"Love it!   I love this app! I can listen to radio stations from all over the country. This app allows you to set the alarm to your favorite radio station so you don't have to wake up to that annoying buzzer. I highly recommend it!"
25715,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-08,4,"pretty good   this is a pretty good app. don't listen to the people who say you need facebook, it's not true. you can sign in with facebook or email, but that's only if you want to save stations or make your custom station. you can still listen to the radio without facebook or email."
25717,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-28,5,"It is the best music app period.   Internet radio is great! Search by artist is the best! Building your favorite music list is easy. I have nothing but praise for this app."

25722,"iHeartRadio",2016-06-02,4,"My favorite radio streaming tool   My favorite radio streaming tool.  Has features like pandora where you create a station, and it also lets you stream real radio stations."
25723,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-24,5,"Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora!   I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? It's free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can't say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can't listen to stand up comedians, and I can't figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I'm stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I don't listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I didn't think it was an app problem. It's smooth, doesn't take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"
25727,"iHeartRadio",2011-12-03,1,"Droid Charge force close!   I have a droid charge and this app will never work. Every time I tried to search for station it force closed!"
25733,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-16,5,"Now I listen!   Love the variety of programing available and now listen to my Kindle far more than before.  With the addition of a mini-external speaker to my Kindle, it is a joy!"
25735,"iHeartRadio",2013-04-10,5,"Facebook account not required   Facebook account not required, it is an option. It allows you to create your own account unrelated to facebook. I created a new account and am able to save my favorite stations and playlists. I love the updates: alarm clock and sleep function. When I travel, I like the ability to listen to my home radio stations. Great app!"
25736,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-23,5,"You create your own station   Imagine not having to change a channel, you choose your favorite artists and genre and ittakes it from there.  Love it!"
25738,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-18,1,"commercials galore!   Couldn't stand hearing all the awful commercials and radio blather. Didn't realize it's Clear Channel which is a Monopoly. Switched to Pandora...AH!"
25739,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-13,5,"Wonderful Radio App   I really like this app. All kinds of music to choose from.  You can select as many as you like.  Love it!!!"
25746,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-23,5,"i heart radio   everything i expected and it was free! i can listen to wgar from clevelnd anywhere i go. makes my day fly by"
25748,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-15,5,"So much music   I'm in my fifties and recently downloaded this. I was pleasantly surprised by how much music and the variety that iHeart has. I can listen to music from my high school days at work and then find something a little louder once I get home. With the huge collection, I could probably find music from when my folks were dating."
25750,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-06,4,"Very enjoyable!!!! Has streaming problems   This iheart radio app is amazing, has most of the station's on the air I enjoy, has other radios and settings, and just like Pandora as you can choose any genre or artist, or create you're own station. The only problem that I had is the streaming is sometimes temporarily off, but other than that, I heart iheart radio!!!!!"
25758,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-03,5,"YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK!!!!!!!!   You guys can use use your email. It has an option to do that or facebook. Anyway, this app is awesome!"
25760,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-08,4,"We have been able to enjoy news and music with that little bit of aloha ...   Been missing Hawaii and a trip there for a visit hasn't happened in a few years. We have been able to enjoy news and music with that little bit of aloha added in from the first place we called home together. so many stations to choose from it has been fun exploring what's available."
25767,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-04,4,"Great station. you can play different songs   Great station.you can play different songs. You can also get local stations and also other stations from different towns.  love it.."
25768,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-03,5,"A lot of content.   Wow!  Who knew?  I am in my 60's and try to keep up but it isn't easy.  I have Sirius/XM and love it and I have the app and that is great but  wanted to get a local station and downloaded iHeart to see if they had it, they don't but I found a plethora of other channels that I loved, mostly comedy.  Like Larry the Cable Guy and John Pinette and Jim Gaffigan and Lewis Black, you get the idea.  There are only a few from each performer than a bunch of others like Ralphie May and Gabrielle Eglesis.  I believe they are come on's to buy the albums but still there is a lot of content here.  And tons of music.  I run it on my Kindle Fire HD and think it is great.  When I was a kid we had transistor radios and huge record players, this stuff is amazing compared to that."
25773,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-20,4,"Its agreeable   It's good for the standards I was looking for:good music,any radio station I wanted,music from different states,and to just have music when I wanted!But there's a few problems that I had and they made this app disappointing which is:you have a a certain amount off skips for each day which means if you wanted to go through an artist's album you can skip through but you don't have unlimited skips so you have to wait through every song just to reach the next which gets frustrating,next when you look up a song they sometimes don't have the right one or they just don't have it,also some stations are not there,I live in Pennsylvania and I tried to look up a lot of our good stations but they were not there,so therefore it's a good app but it doesn't come to every extent you would like,there's probably many more problems and or many more good things about this app but trust me it's only good for the radio stations.PS-This app does include a great Comedy station,they are hilarious and it's worth listening too!*I do recommend this app."
25776,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-22,5,"Loving the variety!!!!!!!!!   I'm enjoying the variety of radion stations available.  Depending on my mood, I can find something to suit how I'm feeling.I'm kind of confused with logging on to facebook though.  Help."
25777,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-29,4,"Better than local; will never equal the past.   It is 100% better than any radio station out there today; that being said, it does not come close to the stations, and the independent format of decades ago. How many remember the ""King Biscuit Flower Hour""?  There are literately millions of albums and singles out there which are never played; although not a top 40 format, they do repeat the same song within a few hours. I remember well the great independent format of the late 60's and early 70's WQSR 102.5  Sarasota FL; its call letters were Quad 102 1/2, in today's market everything pre-recorded on a disk, I doubt if ever we will see or I should say hear real music format again."
25781,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-08,5,"Awesome   This app is so perfect. Love the variety! I learned about new artists I really like because when you make one station for a certain song or artist it includes other songs along the same genre. The only issue is having to be connected to the internet, but other than that I get to l listen to Melanie Martinez, Twenty one pilots, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At The Disco, Black Veil Brides, Evanascence and so much more at its best."
25790,"iHeartRadio",2017-09-20,4,"Keeps defaulting to a station I do not want!   I jumped on this so I could hear my favorite talk station that I listened to when I lived in L.A.  Then I found great jazz stations around the U.S. on this app, so all is good.The only downside is that this app keeps insisting that I signed-up for a pop-country station...the kind that plays big money bling country.  If I was interested in a country station, I would only want to hear old school country that is real...not the crap that is cranked out by the Illuminati millionaire machine.  Until a station like that lands on the iHeart app, I will keep turning-off the station that I did not add to my selections on this app (it keeps defaulting to that dreadful station...argh!)"
25794,"iHeartRadio",2017-08-09,3,"I love it, but there's two problems....   I got this app two days ago, and it's awesome! I can listen to whatever I want, and I don't even have to be on the app to listen to it! I can be on Instagram and listen to my music. In fact, I'm listening to it as I am writing this review. But there is one ting about the app I absolutely CANNOT STAND. You have a limited number of times you can skip songs. That is just stupid on SO many levels. Why in the heck would an app have limited skips?!?!?!?! How stupid can you get? The other problem is that you can't be under 14 or something like that to get an account. Me and my sister had to lie to get an account. I am 13, I should be able to have an account for myself because of my age...."
25795,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-20,1,"Wth happened!   I have been using this daily, for months, and loved it for my runs. Suddenly, an ""internal error"" message. What did you guys do to screw this up for all of us. Wouldn't even give you 1 star, but if I have to, I have to."
25798,"iHeartRadio",2016-02-22,5,"The PROs and PRO CONsss....   The pros: I liked the fact that I didn't have to tell it each hour that I was listening to it.  The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me.  I'd recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them.  Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON.  LOL."
25802,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-24,5,"I really appreciate how easy it is!   I enjoy listening to music any time but I find it makes cleaning and most other things (such as wrapping presents as I am working on now) seem to go that much smoother and faster! I particularly enjoy using this app because I can just choose a station that fits whichever chore I'm working on or musical mood I'm in and I can listen wherever I am without worrying whether the station will tune in well or have static as I often experienced and was frustrated by with any alarm clock or other type of standard radio receivers! I have this app installed on my kindle fire HD as well as on my smartphone and I regularly use both! Also, I love that you are able to log in either through your Facebook account or, if you're like me and don't care to share your listening preferences with all your friends (my preferences vary so extremely that I would probably come across as having a multiple personality), through your email. Finally, I love that the commercial breaks aren't overwhelming...from what I recall I would say that the commercial breaks are comparable to a standard radio station such as what I used to listen to before this app!"
25807,"iHeartRadio",2015-10-01,5,"Fantastic!!!   This app is the best! If you have a favorite song, you can create a customizable station just for you around that song, and sculpt it to your taste in music over time. They have loads of genres available, and tons of predesigned stations around those genres. You can listen to your local radio, too, if that's your cup of tea. But I would give this app 11/10! Best music experience I've had with any app ever. Which reminds me, why are reading this when you could be downloading iHeartRadio?? It's actually free, it won't cost you a single penny, unlike other apps."
25815,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-23,5,"Easy to install   Listen to Clear Channel stations all the time.  Travel  around country sometimes so nice to always find my favorite talk shows!"
25819,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-23,5,"Favorite Music ApP   This is by far my favorite music app . i used to like Pandora and slacker. But I found this app and Its totally free. I Listen to this app from 6 to 10 every morning . I listen to Bud And Broadway. They are awesome. Couldnt live without it"
25822,"iHeartRadio",2017-07-07,1,"Difficult   Where do I start? As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I didn't even choose, it's super slow, and recently it's been telling me I can't UAE it because something from my app store wasn't updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it's not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I'm better off deleting it."
25825,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-04,3,"I heart radio app   To be honest here the app design sucks, I mean it is very disappointing the fact that you need to go by state or country in to oder to find a radio station. You should make the app more simple and similar to the surface rt or Xbox 360 iheart radio app. In the surface rt or Xbox 360 when searching for a live radio station from its genre it shows all the radio stations from all over the world in that genre that you first chose. Another thing is when creating radio stations the search bar should be smarter."
25832,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-21,5,"Best music streaming video App!   My only problem with Iheart was that I could only listen to one genre at a time but with the creation of my favorites radio it now does exactly what I want... Without having to pay"
25834,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-19,2,"Used to be good, now has annoying countdown on channels   I will be listening to WNCI on Iheart radio so I can listen to their morning show, and suddenly get interrupted by their annoying Iheart Radio count down of top songs. Not just one short group, but two & sometimes three of them. I like to listen to my choice of programming & don't care about Justin Bieber top 5 or whoever else they want to plug. Needless to say I will be finding something else & switching."
25835,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-10,4,"love it!   I love being able to listen to all the local radio stations on this app, that's the one thing pandora doesn't have. My only complaint would be that if you turn off the explicit content, it wouldn't let you on any stations after that to listen to music, you would have to turn it on again. That really bothered me. Though it may have radio stations, pandora doesn't have that problem."
25836,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-08,1,"SUCKS   SUCKS!!To even listen to music you have to sign up. You have to give your E-Mail. And to save you have to sign up for Facebook. I don't have a Facebook account.ITS A SPACE WASTER.(if you don't have a Facebook account)"
25843,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-17,1,"Sucks   It doesn't play 'like music' nor have a good amount of new or unknown music even when you tell it to. It's pretty bad. It doen't stick to the genre you selected. SURE, Pandora will sneak in Bob Marley into every station, but when I'm listening to Brand New ans Justin Timberlake comes up and makes you say WHOA, wat a minute what the hell just happened, did my station just switch on me? Oh no, it's just iHeartRadio sucking as usual. I had to use this app while living in Costa Rica because Pandora wasn't available. It was depressing. Use Pandora. unless you are like my mom, she would love iHeartRadio. If you are someone who just likes to listen to whatever is trendy in the pop culture genres, this is for you."
25848,"iHeartRadio",2013-04-28,5,"LOVE IT   I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE THIS APP IT IS SOOOOOOO MUCH MORE THAN FUN.PS I'M ONLY 11 :) my friends talk about the app all the time"
25850,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-03,4,"Very Nice App   I really like your ability to choose similar artists and listen to those. You are not listening to, only, one artist; yet, you have variety."
25853,"iHeartRadio",2015-10-15,5,"like breathing, very hard to go long without it!   As I've said a thousand times before on my GS4, absolutely love it. Can change it in a fraction of a second like my moods.  Only problem lately- I keep getting asked to rate it at least once a song, sometimes twice. I counted.I got asked to rate it 67 times in one day after I had already said I liked it several times and submitted it. I definitely HEART iHeart Radio. I've actually started a whole new collection of CDs from works I've heard here first!"
25857,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-13,5,"Very torn on this rating....   I loved the way my son has been able to use this on his iphone, so that's why I wanted it on my tablet, but it has not been as great for me.  When I tried to open it, I had to answer a bunch of questions, and it forced a sign in either through my Facebook or email.  I was going to choose Facebook, but then found this is yet another app that wants permission to pretend to be me, and I will NEVER permit any app to do that.  So, back to the sign in.  It proceeded smoothly with the email option, but once I got in, it basically took over my tablet.  I couldn't use anything else, and I HEART RADIO basically froze on my screen.  I had to completely reboot to turn it off.  Doubt I'll use it again on my tablet, which is a pity.  I do like the product, though.  My son has it on his iphone, which plugs into his car system by USB, and I love the ""created"" station option, which lets us pick a genre, and hear the kind of music we prefer without ads & chat.  It's great for road trips."
25858,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-31,5,"Easy to Use. Listening to Music is great fun   This is a great app.It offers recommendations for music based on other songs you listen to. This is not a problem except that your stationswill not have only the songs you want. When you create stations to listen to songs, for example, if you create a pink station to listen to songs only from Pink- you will find that there are songs from other artists on there. This is a frustration for my 12 year old daughter who wants it to have only songs from pink on her pink station.However, if you push the thumb down on a song, it almost never plays that song again.We have this app on our phone, our ipad, our kindle, and so on. It is an easy to use app.Well worth the effort. Enjoy."

I grew up in Southern California and there was one station that I've been listening to since high school. Unfortunately, I ended up moving out of the county and couldn't get the station on the radio. Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD. Personally, I don't bother with logging into Facebook because I have no interest in creating my own stations. I prefer listening to live radio and like that I can choose any station in the country that they offer."
25915,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-07,3,"Needs a few improvements   Overall, I like this app better than Pandora because I couldn't get Pandora to work for very long on my Kindle Fire HD. IHeart Radio allows you to create your own station, however...once you select an artist you like, it only plays one song from that artist and then moves on to some other artist. If my station is created by clicking on a particular artist, I would expect ALL songs to be from that same artist. Also, the app kept shutting down or freezing up on me recently. I was able to get it going again, but only after it closed by itself about 4 or 5 times, so there are obviously issues with it. It would be nice to have more stations to choose from as well, especially for California. Most of the stations were East Coast (New York) based stations. Otherwise, once it plays it's great for a free app."
25918,"iHeartRadio",2016-06-20,5,"Great App! Perfect for fangirls!   I can say, this app is way better than Pandora and Spotify mixed together, plays all my favourite music.:) Really great for when you are a hard core fangirl."
25919,"iHeartRadio",2017-10-27,4,"Better than being forced to listen to the same ol..   Like it. It's still too early to do a full review but opted for the cheapest option. I like that I now have a more personalized music list and sometimes listen to my phone in the car instead of constantly pushing buttons on my stereo. This and the last remaining indie station in my area is what I will be staying with."

25927,"iHeartRadio",2016-04-03,5,"great for streaming music   I use this app frequently. I love how easy it is to create a radio station. You can even change up what types of songs it offers you if you start hearing the same ones all the time by having it play by tuning the station to play top hits, mix or variety. I wish the amazon music app was set up more like this one."
25930,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-07,5,"iHeartRadio Steps Up Their Game   Z100 is my favorite, one and a kind radio station. They just took themselves to another level. You know the crew, Greg T., Bethany, all of em'. Now you got em at your fingertips as long as you got WI-FI. You can listen to all your favorite songs while at the gym, or even at your office. This is one app to get! Yes, it's free people. See why we like iHeartRadio? Also, you got a variety of other radio stations like 'Moves That Swagger Radio'. You can even look up different artists to see if they have a station like 'Nico and Vinz Radio', and you can build your own custom station. Now stop being amazed and get this app! Prepare to be bopping your head."
25931,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-29,4,"Not bad   I heard good things about this app, so I downloaded it. I like that you can listen to some live music channels without having to log into Facebook or an email account. But it seems that if you want to customize at all what channels you want to listen to, it forces you to log in to Facebook or an email account, which I usually don't feel like going to all the bother to do. So my selection of music is limited due to that. Usually I just like to open apps and use them without going into another account. But it is a free app at least, which is good."
25934,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-04,4,"Great App.   I like it more than I wanted to, and I use it more than I thought I would. Great music for free, with commercials few and far between. My one warning, when you type and artist/band name, for a personalized radio, you don't just get that artist, you get that and any artist similar....Which is a pro or con depending upon your musical preferences. I find it a pro because I find music I might not have found otherwise, but I can see how it could be a con for some. easy to use."

25940,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-13,3,"Not the best radio app for a Kindle, but it's OK.   A decent app, but not the very best for radio listening.  It does load quickly on a Kindle HD but the interface is a little clunky and takes too much user action to search and the station list, domestic and international, is very small compared to other services.Recommended stations automatically pop up and the developers should take a look at whatever algorithm they use for this feature because most of the stations recommended for me are way off the mark when compared to the stations I have been selecting. It's frustrating.Icons and text are a size geared more for smartphone screens rather than Kindle screens. For a Kindle, it would be more efficient and easier to use if they were smaller."

No it doesn't lag, doesn't shut down on me, etc, but it DOES make me watch an ad before I can listen. That's my first pet peeve with this. The second one is the fact that I have a SKIP. LIMIT. It annoys me so much, I can't stand it. I have several customized stations, and the thing is, if there's a song I don't like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist, I can't. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall, a decent app. The sound quality is good, there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations, and it's easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."
25966,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-02,5,"I <3 iHeart Radio ;)   I LOVE iHeart Radio!! It is a great app with great music! I love that you can stream live radio from the app, especially because this way I can listen to my fav radio stations wherever I am, regardless of whether there is a tower nearby. My ONLY complaint, and it is little, is that when you are making a custom station, you can't add more than one band or artist to add more variety. But I also have Pandora, which does do that, so it is not a big deal. Overall, I highly recommend this app!!"
25968,"iHeartRadio",2015-09-25,3,"Pandora Is Better   Not nearly as good as Pandora. I think iHearRadio claims to have more songs in their library than Pandora, but I don't see how that's true.  I listened to one of their pre-made stations- not a live radio feed- and heard a couple songs repeat in a few hours.  I never have that with Pandora.  That being said, it is nice to have the additional variety of pre-made stations available beyond the genre stations on Pandora.  iHearRadio is a good compliment to Pandora, but if this was the only internet ""radio"" available I would think that internet radio is lame."
25973,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,1,"Sorry. Not as good as Pandora. Needs work.   It doesn't provide lyrics. No way to find out what previous songs played (when I miss a couple). It doesn't even tell you about the artists."

25978,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,3,"not user friendly   Granted I haven't used it much. The first time out was to live stream a specific radio station, which seems to be the best use of this app. Or using their pre-built play lists. To me it's not very user friendly when it comes to customizing, and to me the genres and artist lists seem limited. I don't really get their ""mood/activity"" suggestions either. I've been a big Pandora fan for several years, with a paid subscription and I would definitely use Pandora first. I was having some interference issues so I loaded  iHeartRadio to compare and trouble shoot."

About a month in (after some update)  the app would cut out for no reason and make no attempt to reconnect to the radio station.  Now the app cuts out  multiple times and I have to re-sign in and tap the play/pause button to reconnect to the station.  I use the TuneIn Radio app whenever this app acts up.  I would use TuneIn for everything but it can not play iHeart stations.  I really like my local iHeart station, but I can't stand how often the station cuts out and the app does not make any effort to reconnect unless you manually stop and start the transmission.... TuneIn will cut out occasionally but it has always retrieves the signals within a minute.  AGAIN THIS app does not seem to care about reconnecting after the signal cuts out."

Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the?  I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east?  I was hitting the choices to see what would happen.  Once I got a station on favorites (always by mistake), it was futile to remove it from the list.  Know what?  I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?!  Just more headaches.  The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who don't sit hitting buttons all day long.  Lastly, there didn't appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music.  I'm  not a  Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days.  We Boomers aren't dead yet, people!

All of a sudden my Pandora signal poops out. There's ssscccrrreeeaaammmin children, that I can hear 4-5 isles over, from where I was standing. Thankfully!!!, I recall hearing a commercial for iHeartRadio. It's downloaded and operating very quickly. The signal throughout the entire store was awesome. I MEAN AWESOME!!! The variety of stations that are offered is mindboggling. Thank you, so much!!!"

26185,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-28,1,"Annoying to Use   The I heart radio app is so annoyingly commercialized I really dislike using it. First of all when you turn it on you get a 30 second ad which you cannot skip. Secondly, your last station may or may not be on the app without searching for minutes at a time. And finally when you go to rate the app at the Apple store guess what happens? If you give it a low rating the review mysteriously gets immediately rejected! Hows that for keeping all reviews positive! This type of dishonesty and unethical conduct is pretty much what clear channel used to be accused of. All in all its an ok app for listening to music but it is annoying to use and they dont want you to tell anyone about its defects."

The music suggested for various occupations did not suit me either. To find music I like, it was necessary to  create a station with my choice of music. This is possible only by using either a Facebook or email account. Don't want an account even though it's free. Goodbye I Heart radio. You're not for me."

I have to hit the pause button then hit the play button about once every ten minutes or so. I've contacted Iheart about this and was given several ideas of how to make the problem go away, but none have worked. Now, I'm inclined to think this may be an advertizing scheme of Iheart. Each time I have to restart the program, I have to listen to a commercial then the program I was listening to resumes. Does Iheart have a counter going on that ticks off one more tune in by a customer for the company they are advertising for?I'm inclined to think Iheart won't let this comment be posted."

26226,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-20,4,"complements TuneIn Radio   similar to TuneIn radio, but it's handy to keep both if (as in my case) the stations I want to listen aren't all carried on one or the other. Using only TuneIn I could listen to the programs I wanted live but from another city, but iHeart has some local stations TuneIn doesn't (and vice versa). If you're stuck with commercials, they might as well be for something that applicable to you (same for news & weather). Of the two I do prefer TuneIn, but additional choices is always a good thing"
26227,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-17,5,"No regrets   I cancelled my Pandora subscription due to their political stance. Wished I had been using iHeartRadio all along. I am certainly getting more from this free app than I ever got from Pandora."

26231,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-08,4,"awesome when it's not crashing!   Nice mixture of music and very low on adds especially compared to a couple others out there. Some of the stations can get a tad bit repetitive, but there's enough to choose from that I am usually content. The only issue I have is it crashes every once in a while and I end up having to restart the kindle. For the most part I can deal with that, just when it does it multiple times a day. Tedious waiting on all that when trying to just jam for a moment."

It gets ANNOYING, if you don't sign in it doesn't let you access your customized stations.THE UGLY:DON'T RELY ON the ALARM feature !!! It always crashes and the ALARM doesn't go on.

I can make my own stations, choosing the artists who I want to hear. I have stations for every genre. This is a great app. Pick an artist and iheart will play similar artists, making a great station. Then there are the live stations from all over the country. Stations for every genre of music. Many thanks to I heart radio for hours of entertainment."
26260,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-14,2,"Al's Review   I like to be able to listen to radio on my Kindle.  I really don't like the difficulty of turning it on and off.  When I stop the radio playing and close the kindle, it starts to play again continuously.  Each time I go into the app, it is difficult to find the station I want to listen to.  And when I do find it, and tap it, often I miss slightly and another one comes on.  When this happens, I am unable to delete that station."
26261,"iHeartRadio",2012-07-29,5,"Good app   This is a great app for the music and works well on the Kindle Fire. As a new owner I see some apps work well on it and some do not. So far this is a keeper."

26268,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-17,5,"Recommended!   I have a radio, but I only use it for the auxiliary because the live radio stations don't work. This app has saved my life!

I can finally just plug in my headphones and just jam out to my favorite tunes, whether I own them on Amazon or not!"

Nothing is more annoying than trying to listen to your favorite music and the station starts glitching! So I was having a lot of trouble with my Pandora account as usual and I was so over it and I asked all of my Facebook friends what is a good app for listening to good music and they suggested iheat radio. I downloaded it and now I'm so impressed with the results! This is a good app to have unless you don't have WiFi. You have to download it! I use mine every day."

If I am diving listening to the radio and something comes on I don't like or want to hear I can change as I wish... just wish I could do this on this app as well. At least slacker radio will make u listen to 1 song to get another skip back so I gave them 5 stars."

26311,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-13,5,"It's so good, I feel guilty neglecting Pandora Radio.   This is a really wonderful radio, I didn't expect it to be so good. This is commonly from a long-time Pandora Radio User. It has less interruptions as Pandora, and works more efficiently. (as an app) I don't have to upgrade to a different plan to get certain plans. It's seriously a really good app, I feel like I'm neglecting Pandora after the history we've had together. I sometimes get too guilty that I check in with Pandora just to see if it's ok (I'm normal, I swear!!) But anyways this is a wonderful app it's really miraculous. You will defiantly enjoy it!! *Thumbs Up*"
26315,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-05,5,"GET THIS APP!!!!!   This is the best radio app I have ever got. Pandora and those other radio apps you usally have to pay a fee for certain songs or stations. But iheart radio u get every station for free! You just need to sign up with Facebook or email and you can get any station. I also recomend this app for any age kid this is coming from a twenty-five year old man. Get this app and you will be happy. :):):):):):):)P.s. I recommend country (I love it the best)!!!!"

I love the fact that I can listen to all the different radio stations in the country, especially the ones on Long Island. I grew up on LI, so to be able to listen to those radio stations again, brings back a lot of memories. But aside from that, being able to listen to all my favorite artists and create stations based off of them is the best part."

Every once in a while there is a pause but it more than likely could be a wireless connection.  It's never paused for more than a minute or so and it's not often enough for me to give it less than 5 stars.  There are so many music apps out there but I'm satisfied with this one until there's reason not to be."
26334,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-22,5,"Love this app.   I love this app. Unlike other music apps I've tried, this one doesn't stop. It doesn't interrupt the music with a screen asking if I'm still in the room. That is so annoying. I also love the variety of music chosen for ""my"" stations."

26452,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-27,1,"Stop buffering!   When I first installed this app, I was impressed by the option to search for your favourite station or artist. So after searching for my absolute favourite artist, I was amazing when it made a customizable playlist which I played (so far so good) and then it just stopped and buffered itself. I thought, okay, I can wait a minute or two. Nope, the dumb thing kept buffering. It's been two hours now and I think I'll just uninstall and get TuneIn radio instead."

26545,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-29,5,"I love it! A little confusing but still awesome!!   The best songs are on kids Nick but adventure the song albums. It's only my opinion, but all the best songs are on that album. ANYWAYS, I recommend you get this app, you can listen to it as you play other games, when your on the web, but I havnt Reyes to listen while I don't have any wifi. I guess you can figure that out!! :D  Try this out, it's great app! Get it and find the best albums and share it to the world, that's the reason why I'm doing this now. :)"
26551,"iHeartRadio",2012-05-09,5,"AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!!   Have no idea why some people are not liking this awesome app. You DO NOT need a facebook to use it as others have stated. Have had no problems on my kindle fire. There is even an option that provides you the lyrics to the song you are listening to. If you don't want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!"

26612,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-10,5,"best music app   I love this app I like listening to old school rock and rap and it always has the best selection and even songs I didn't think they would have like Lenny Williams. Better than Pandora even the ads are better cause they aren't in the way and you don't have to listen  to them like Pandora makes you do...love  it....hope one yea  I can go to the festival....definitely Reccomend. I love playing it while I'm in the shower getting ready for work best motivation is good music in the early mornings...download now!!!!!!"
26613,"iHeartRadio",2016-11-22,4,"Don't like ads, but love the app!   Don't like the occasional ads, but I've only had it for 2 days and I've been listening to comedy, holiday music, and acapella like my favorite group straight no chasers!"
26617,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-27,4,"My favorite radio stations whenever I want them!   I don't have a radio in the house anymore so it's great to have the option of my favorite radio stations, coming in loud & clear, whether they're local or far away. Growing up, whenever I drove upstate NY, I always remembered tuning into a local Poughkeepsie rock station. It's still going strong and the music is still great!My only suggestion is to get more stations involved. Couldn't find one from the NJ shore or my old college station that now plays jazz."
26618,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-02,5,"Best Music app!!   This music lets you pick what kind of music you like. Then you can pick your favorite artists. Also you can play games while you listen to music. I love this app. You get reminders if it needs an update. Also you get cool stuff on your email like if there is something special going on. All in all I think you should get this app."
26623,"iHeartRadio",2017-09-15,5,"Five Stars   Great App!"
26627,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-01,3,"Thumbs down means thumbs down.   Overall this is a nice app for listening to music. What gripes me the most is that I will see songs that I have disliked keep repeating. The app also doesn't suit my eclectic taste in music. Once I start to get a radio station with a good amount of my favorite music, I increase my variety only to get songs that 70% of the time I end up disliking."
26630,"iHeartRadio",2017-03-30,5,"Great   I frequently listen to music and I really like the change is musical genres that are available on IHeartRadio"
26631,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-24,5,"Love It!   I love iHeartRadio. It is great for playing at work because you can choose the music you like without worrying that something that a patient could find offensive might come on."
26632,"iHeartRadio",2016-04-04,5,"Best music   I love the music that they give me its better than Pandora because on iheart  radio they don't play advertisement as often as Pandora does. So I love this app better."

And for you guys out there who don't have a phone to listen to music and you want to impress a girl by your voice or your dancing use this it work and you can get any station you want."

26666,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,5,"My favorite music app.   This app is fantastic. You get to pick and choose what kind of radio ""station"" you want by choosing a specific artist, song, or genre. It's just like Pandora, but better. There's a short advertisement at the very beginning of choosing your station but that's it. I love the clean and modern look to the app also. I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone who doesn't really want to spend money on music."
26669,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-04,5,"Great sounds   The best radio around and if you get tired of one station you can switch to another very easy."

I hope you love this app. This is rated 5 stars. I recommend Air 1, K-Love, Britt Nicole radio, and Kim Walker Smith radio. Also, music rocks!!!DaraRocks"
26694,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-28,5,"It's great!   I love this app because you can create your own stations and listen to the music that you want. I especially like the 'perfect for' option, where they have different themes for different days. For example, Sunday evening you could pick relaxing, candlelight dinner, dancing, or video games music, but that's not even all of the options! This app works perfectly on the kindle fire. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music."
26697,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-21,5,"Love It   My son told me about the iHeartRadio app and I love it! The great thing is I can scan stations and not lose my original station. Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."

My favorite local radio station was sold and converted to talk radio.  Very, very disappointing.  There's no other station to take its place, so this gives me a very pleasant replacement, at least while I'm home."
26706,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-03,4,"Great for most things   I listen to this app more than anything else.  Only down side is some streaming radio channels like The Blaze won't play continuously.  I thought maybe it was a signal strength issue till I streamed these changes from their web site and they played without issue.  If they could stream live feeds more reliably, it would be a 5 star app for sure."

26718,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-08,3,"Was amazing before the update   Ever since my kindle fire has updated this, Iheartradio has become a disappointment. I will be listening to a song and the app will close, I will constantly reopen it and it will play for a while, then close again. It has become obnoxious after the seemingly thousandth time of this happening. It is nice if you just want music as your background and you leave the app open while your cleaning, but other than that it's upsetting.Off to try Pandora"
26724,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-26,4,"I like it as a whole   I like it as a whole, but I find it a little hard maneuvering around songs.  It may just be me because others I have talked to didn't have any problems."

They got some cheap MP3 players from a relative for Christmas and were all excited until after the batter ran down the first time we couldn't recharge them.  I spent a great deal of time trying to decide whether to replace with MP3 players, ipods, ipads, .....  We already had a kindle and we are all sharing it, so after some consideration and test driving iHeartRadio, I decided to get them kindles."

26743,"iHeartRadio",2017-02-28,5,"Awesome. Just awesome.   Absolutely awesome! I like how the app adds more stuff in that you might like, but if you don't like it, then you can just press the thumbs down button. I found some of my favorite songs on this app. Two thumbs up."

26746,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-28,4,"Pandora is better   I downloaded this app because of buzz on the radio. It's pretty cool because you can get local radio stations which in my location, don't come in on the real radio. I, however still prefer Pandora to this and hardly ever use this app anymore."

26750,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-22,1,"iHeartMedia Right Wing strategy   Due to iHeartMedia's delivery of right-wing, conservative talk radio, I will be deleting this app from my devices. They buy existing local AM stations and convert them to right-wing formats, which is part of the ongoing right wing strategy to dominate US communications.  Fortunately, there are still other options that provide more balanced and realistic reporting of the news and the issues."
26752,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-16,5,"Listen to RUSH every day.  The Kindle is great for audio books as well as other books.   I like KFYR Bismarck for listening to RUSH every day.  I recommend every one to listen to RUSH.  The weather information is good too.  I have listened to KFYR since I was a child or 85 years. We have the book ""Mercy for Me"" on the Kindle.  We like it because we know the author personally.  My husband's vision is poor so on the Kindle the print can be enlarged enough so he can read it."

26799,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-09,4,"Best radio App out there.   I was a Pandora user like most of us, that was until they had a 6 song limit or whatever it was. I HEART is a good App that is  100% free and you can find just about any radio station you're looking for.  I moved to Houston about two years ago and Houston is where I reside now. The one thing I missed most was the music.  I found both of my favorite Hawaiian reggae stations on IHEARTRADIO. So I am able to keep up with the new jams comin out of Hawai'i! It's a blessing!"
26808,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-02,5,"iheartRadio   I love this app. I love that i can customize it easily. I love that I don't need f facebook to use it. I love it on my kindle, since i can listen and read at the same time."

26810,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-09,5,"Amazing!!!!!   I believe this is way better than Pandora or Slacker radio. So far, I haven't seen any limits in skipping or time. It rarely buffers, skips, or crashes. I also haven't seen one song play twice and I have found many new bands that I have never even heard of that I absolutely love! I look at all of the bad rated reviews and they look like personal problems or user error. Nothing wrong with the app itself."
26814,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-01,3,"I don't listen to Secular Music   If I pick &#34;Sacredharp Music&#34; it'll randomize to music (rock,rap,pop...exc.) far from it... same with Old Hymns, Gospel or even Bluegrass Gospel... can't I Heart stay within my choice to praise God?"
26818,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-20,5,"Great Way to Listen to Home Town Stations   Okay, it doesn't have all the stations I want, but it does allow me to listen to stations that I grew up with, offering a little home-town news and flavor. I find myself listening to this more than local radio stations."

26826,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-01,5,"This is the one   I love iHeartRadio. I used to use Pandora but the format changed and I was highly disappointed. This radio app is more tailored to the artist or band you want to hear. Unlike Pandora as of late, when you listen to iHeartRadio you actually hear the artist or band you originally created the station for. This is a definite must have for music lovers, I have it on my home computer, phone and most recently my Kindle Fire HD."
26833,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-16,5,"It's easy, I found exactly what I wanted to hear, so it's the Best!   This is a service that wants to please the customer. It's so easy, it's a gift. It works so well, it's amazing. For example, I like to hear a few people on KFI Lost Angels--I mean, Los Angeles. Well, I can get them here, on anything! I may even try to get  them on my 'lectric toothbrush. I can listen on my Kindle Fire, on my lap top--I could even listen, if I wanted to, on my wonderful old Gateway desktop PC, if it hadn't of been completely destroyed by some idiot and his malware."

I had to continuously download the little shellfish app, but now my frets have been put at ease.  I adore the iheart radio app, to say the least.  Thanks to this app I can listen to music all the time, but here's the catch... it's my kind of music that plays for my moods.  And being woman, I have a constant merry go round of mood swings.  So thanks for the fantastic app, for all the Moody people roaming the Earth."

I slept for a year and a half for 18 -20 hours a day.  I have always had music in my life.  My parents would play it in the car, house, records, my brothers & sister would pretend to be in a band and use out funiture for drums, keyboards, etc., I was always listening.  So now that IHeart Radio is available on my computer, cell phone, & kindle, I have started listening again.  It is clear, easy, and comforting."

I was easily able to access the bands and radio stations I wanted to listen to. That says a lot right there, because I am not a computer savvy person. I listened for two hours one day while scrubbing the house. iHeart radio did not interrupt the music with meaningless ads, and there weren't any banner ads, or general garbage covering  my Kindle screen. I wasn't seriously thrilled with the listening experience, because iHeart played songs I did not listen to from the Awesome 80's."

It also keeps me very busy if I'm bored, I just make different stations of my on of songs that I love to listen to. The one thing that it has changed about me is that it's gotten me into lots of different types of music I never I thought I would ever like or even listen to. Shout out to the Facebook page that got me to get the app. Thank you. #BESTAPPEVER <3"

Not only that. but if I have friends over...who skip songs ....next thing I know I lose my skip privilege for 24 hrs.  I wonder what she will say if I continue to ask to skip......Although I appreciate the free music...its not playing anything in the same Genre that I originally asked.  Maybe the first few songs...I was listening to Classic Rock songs, now some Jazz....and I cant skip.  Thanks."
26955,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-01,5,"great app   I like this app because it lets you create your own stations and if you hear a song you like you can make a station after it. It doesn't just ply a song you like once and never play it again, it will actually play the songs you like. The other best part is you can have alot of stations and out of those you can make favorites and they will all be in their own section and easy to get to."

26989,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-09,5,"great but   I got it it is a thousand times better easier to find music then Pandora Pandora is okay compared to iheartradio but for each song you can skip so many times then you have to go to the web site but even then I don't get more but I still give it a five star rating I can listen to New music I've never heard and find new songs that I like look at the good side!!! :-)"
26991,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,1,"WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER   This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process.  Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps..  With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can't find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal.  It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating.  I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all.  If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch.  It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to.  An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

They took away Project 9-6-1 leaving countless Project Family members without a radio home.  Clear Channel is a greedy corporation who blatantly refuses to listen to its customers and is only interested in filling their pockets with money.

27637,"Pandora",2013-09-13,5,"All My Genre   This is really great sound.What a concept!  Just start a station off and it keeps adding same genre songs.Tired of that genre, start another station off and it keeps building, too.Tomorrow want some of the same, then maybe something different, start another station, or start an old one.Thumbs down those songs you don't want and they are gone.  Thumbs up those to tweak the selections of the future songs.Great deal, and no advertisements.I definitely recommend!"
27639,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain   I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
27644,"Pandora",2016-12-03,4,"love it.   at first it didnt work right, cork left in bottle, however now it works perfectly.  love it."
27646,"Pandora",2016-07-20,5,"Highly Recommended   I have been using Pandora Radio for years, I love the stations I have created and I'm always surprised at the song choices they suggest, hidden treasures or forgotten favorites!"
27647,"Pandora",2016-12-15,5,"Music   I enjoy the selection of music gendra.  I turn on Pandora and listen all day to the music"
27650,"Pandora",2013-03-29,5,"Pandora!   I have the free version.  Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it.  The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??"
27651,"Pandora",2016-06-03,4,"Good App   Good App"

27655,"Pandora",2016-05-26,5,"Best Music Player out there!   I love that I get to listen to whatever I want whenever I want. The music quality is as good as I want to make it. PANDORA is EXCELLENT!"

27664,"Pandora",2017-01-29,5,"Very Happy   I am a big fan of Pandora and listen to it often. The app works very well.and was free."

27668,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Pandora Media   I have just applied Pandora and really do like it.  I plan to utilize this item to a great extent."
27674,"Pandora",2014-02-27,4,"love it   Awesome app. Really wish the kindle version didn't take off the sleep timer though. I miss that feature, can't fall asleep to the music anymore because I have to wake up to turn it off. Sigh. Other than that I love this for everything else. Music is in everything I breathe and Pandora almost always plays my moods."
27676,"Pandora",2014-04-16,5,"Wonderful!!!   So enjoy the variety and easy of use.  I carry it with me and it helps me keep working. Thanks!!!!"
27677,"Pandora",2015-11-03,2,"went wrong since last update -.-   Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."
27679,"Pandora",2017-08-24,5,"Five Stars   Good"
27684,"Pandora",2014-08-24,5,"Five Stars   Greatest ever"

27691,"Pandora",2013-12-09,5,"Pandora on Kindle is a great combination.   Pandora has become my go to place to experience new music. I'm still old school enough to find an artist I like and then buy the CD (soon I'll be buying the vinyl). The Pandora app runs great on my Kindle Fire, so now I find myself doing more ""music research"" when laying in bed before I turn the lights out for the night."
27697,"Pandora",2016-06-03,5,"Five Stars   Great"
27699,"Pandora",2014-01-28,5,"Freedom to listen to the songs you really love   I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to, and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down.  Also I can listen to Pandora while I play games on my Kindle fire. Thanks to my grandson for telling me about Pandora as he also uses it, and he showed me how to use it.  Love it."
27704,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"Broken app no longer!   Thank you for fixing.  We are going back to 5 stars.  PANDORA!!!  Have you even noticed the comments since your last update?  Hope you are working on a fix.  Thanks for bringing me music before that."
27706,"Pandora",2015-07-22,5,"Best music station ever   I Downloaded Pandora on my Kindle and instantly fell In love. I work on the beach and this is my go to app for music from every genre. I love how it let's you create your own station. At anytime you can pick up my Kindle and Pandora will be on."
27709,"Pandora",2015-11-05,5,"It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable   We listened to Pandora all the way from Oregon to Palm Springs instead of Sirius.  It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable.  And let's not forget how much less expensive it is."
27711,"Pandora",2016-06-21,5,"I love Pandora. It allows me to listen to all ...   I love Pandora. It allows me to listen to all the music I like whether on one station or several stations. Absolutely love it."

I am able to create stations and playlists of my favorite music, which allows me to simply click on my favorite Irish playlists, and hear my favorite drinking songs!  I love this app!"
27714,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"Five Stars   So far so good with setting up, selecting, and playing."
27715,"Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"short amount of time   In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy.  Now I just need the time to go back for more.  I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!"
27717,"Pandora",2015-11-20,5,"Good stuff   I live this .. I don't listen to the radio very much but this is wonderful to have. I can determine what will be my regular songs & what will be the songs I don't want to hear"
27719,"Pandora",2013-03-24,5,"Pandora application for Kindle   One of the main reasons for buying my Kindle Fire was so I could listen to Pandora in my house through my stereo and also out in my shop through another stereo. It works very well. It is not quite as user friendly as the one on my Macbook but I think with a little time I will learn new tricks and shortcuts. I am very happy with it overall and very grateful to get it for free."
27723,"Pandora",2015-08-03,3,"Too many ads   Good music, like being able to select favorites and skip songs, but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
27726,"Pandora",2015-04-16,5,"Great app   Awesome app. Free version works great. If you don't mind the commercials every now and then, I see no reason to purchase the paid version. Great for getting to know similar or new bands that relate to bands you already know."
27728,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Love it   Love the selection of music"
27730,"Pandora",2014-05-09,2,"not what I expected   I'm sorry that I couldn't make this any better but it doesn't do what I thought it was supposed to do. I wanted to make a play list with an artist. But all this would do is play one selection by the artist and then it started playing other artists that I never heard of...not for me any longer..."
27734,"Pandora",2014-03-18,5,"Pandora Music App   This is an awesome App to purchase if you are looking for a music App that learns as you check whether you like the song it plays at the time. You can create individual band name folders and click thumbs up or thumbs down to make your selection for that individual band you have named each folder you are listening to. It learns as you make your selections and narrows the music it plays until it eventually plays nothing but the band name you picked for each folder. If you want to narrow your search even more you can create folders for specific album names for the band you select. I very highly recommend this App."
27737,"Pandora",2016-06-24,5,"Pandora plays great music based on your choice of performers   I am a music lover. Pandora plays great music based on your choice of performers. Songs played that I hadn't heard in years."

27750,"Pandora",2014-09-18,5,"Two Thumbs Up !   A big fan of free radio.  Could do with less commercials, but I love the customization options it offers.  One bug fix I would love to see though, is that on the Kindle Fire HD it won't work with other apps open, even the Silk browser.  Other than that, it's perfect!"
27751,"Pandora",2014-08-15,5,"Five Stars   We love the variety of music and the ability to choose genres."
27755,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Blues Addict for life.   Love my Blues entertainment every night and playing it with my guitar."
27758,"Pandora",2015-11-25,5,"Awesome!   Pandora is awesome and you can put it on any device that you own.  It is the 'boombox' of 2015.  Love it and it brings the past music era's into the here and now.  Love it!"
27764,"Pandora",2013-06-16,5,"Lots of music fun!   Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to ""like"" and ""dislike"" songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
27765,"Pandora",2014-03-19,5,"Perfect   I love Pandora as i can customize my own station.  I can also make multiple stations for those days when I want to listen to Country and the other days where I need a little spiritual music in my ear.  You can dislike and like songs as you go along to build up your playlist.  Love this app for my Kindle."
27770,"Pandora",2017-10-25,4,"Four Stars   Like my play list. Although they are not able to pull in all the music I request."
27777,"Pandora",2013-03-13,5,"Music For Whatever Mood You Are In   I love Pandora. I have found stations that I probably wouldn't look for otherwise and genres that compliment the mood I am in. I also like the shuffle feature when I'm not sure what I want to listen to knowing it will be something that I like. This is one of the first apps I added. Knew I had to have this one!"

27783,"Pandora",2014-03-13,3,"Good, but unfortunate commercials   I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I don't like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear.  For example, on the Radio for Kids station, there is an egg donation commercial that comes on often that has spurred odd questions."
27784,"Pandora",2016-12-08,5,"I love it. I have not invested in the ad ...   I love it.  I have not invested in the ad free version however I am considering it."
27788,"Pandora",2016-12-07,5,"Five Stars   Awesome music selection.  Listen to this a lot while doing other work on my laptop."
27789,"Pandora",2017-01-25,5,"Five Stars   I have enjoyed Pandora on my laptop. It was exciting to also have it on my Fire!"
27791,"Pandora",2013-03-01,5,"Great!   This is a great app for the tablet and phone. It is by far the best way to stream music."
27793,"Pandora",2013-02-05,5,"Fits my Moods   Pandora is great because I can choose the type of music I am listening to according to my ""mood for the day."" When I am studying I can listen to smooth jazz, when I need inspiration I can listen to Rich Mullins, when I am feeling mellow I can listen to James Taylor, when i need a lift I can listen to Big Band or Beach Boys. The songs are varied and fit the genre I choose."
27795,"Pandora",2017-05-31,4,"it's nice.   Still working on figuring it outSo far...it's nice."
27813,"Pandora",2016-08-17,5,"Works great on the Fire TV Stick   Works great on the Fire TV Stick. Less complicated to use than Pandora app through my tablet and Chromecast."
27818,"Pandora",2014-02-03,5,"Your favorite music, whenever you want it   This app finds music to  fit my mood.  When I want Strauss waltzes, I can hear only waltzes.  When I want easy listening, that's what I get.  I choose thumbs up or down for each piece of music, and the station gives more of the type I want.  There are commercials, but they are fewer than a local radio station."
27819,"Pandora",2015-05-02,3,"pretty good   I find it fun to listen to. It does use up your battery pretty fast though. Also, is regularly skips songs when I don't want it to. Also, it signed me up for pandora one all by itself and I don't know how to get out."
27826,"Pandora",2016-10-31,4,"I have enjoyed the music and very few commercials   Music at your fingertips !I have enjoyed the music and very few commercials . Thanks"
27827,"Pandora",2016-07-15,3,"Pretty much like all the other music apps.   I like Pandora... I just wish the free version allowed one to play ""greatest hits"" by an individual artist."

27835,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Cool   Ya if u need a variety of music or comedy this is a good 👍👍app"
27845,"Pandora",2014-02-26,4,"Free Music!   I enjoy having a diverse selection of artists and musicians at my fingertips! It's also an added bonus that you get to know new artists as well. If you love music, you'll love Pandora. They do repeat songs and the ads are annoying but it's the price you pay for free-you can always upgrade to Pandora One."
27847,"Pandora",2013-07-24,5,"Great music   I use pandora in the car, on my phone, on my Kindle while reading, on my PC while while writing, as well as through my TV when I'm not watching a program. I especially like the fact that I can select a group of entertainers and shuffle the music so I get a variety of styles and performers. Only rarely do I feel the need to skip a particular song."

27853,"Pandora",2014-01-01,3,"Decent   Pandora is a FREE music streaming app. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros :Free music.Free account.You can sign into your account on any device .Cons :Takes WiFi.Cannot select individual songs to play.Cannot skip very many songs every hour.Hope this helped you ! :)"
27857,"Pandora",2016-03-16,4,"I'm delighted with the new look and selection of specific genre ...   Pandora radio has changed a lot since I lasted used it years ago. I'm delighted with the new look and selection of specific genre and the variety."

27883,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"was is there not to love? Works perfect   It's Pandora, was is there not to love? Works perfect. This never locks up or creates any issues for me. Pandora is a great app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants a good free music app full of functionality like building your own ""taste"". This is one of the best mobile apps out there for music by a long shot."
27887,"Pandora",2013-07-01,5,"Great Website!   I've used this website on my PC, and Phone and now on my Kindle. I'm now a Pandora One member. I love that it plays my favorite music and I can listen anywhere. Thank you Pandora !! I also found out that you can ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" a song and Pandora will learn what you like. How innovative. I listen to it on my Kindle and on my smart phone."
27889,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"Downloaded it to kindlefire works great. You'll need a high speed internet connection   Used it on computers before. Downloaded it to kindlefire works great. You'll need a high speed internet connection. It was banned from my work computers because the employees where hogging the bandwidth with Pandora. Ads not bad"
27891,"Pandora",2015-08-29,5,"great music app   Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before."
27894,"Pandora",2012-10-10,5,"Great Music (because you choose it yourself)   I have a very eclectic mix on my station (I subscribe to PandoraOne, but the app is a free download); you can give a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" on any song, and, if you don't like it, will probably not hear anything too much like it again.  I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."
27902,"Pandora",2017-01-26,5,"Five Stars   Love Pandora. I listen to Bluegrass gospel and it is hard to find on radio."

27907,"Pandora",2013-11-16,3,"Great idea, not so great execution.   I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the ""bugs"" are annoying!"
27908,"Pandora",2014-12-13,5,"I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal)   I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL"
27915,"Pandora",2016-05-31,4,"Great but messes up a lot...   It's really good!You get the listen to music for free!The only think I don't like about it is...that is messes up a lot.."

27932,"Pandora",2015-09-21,2,"I've heard Spotify is much better and I would pay for that service   Tons of commercials now and they play the same songs over and over. Must be saving in having to pay royalties. I've heard Spotify is much better and I would pay for that service."
27934,"Pandora",2013-08-20,5,"A radio station to fit every listener   A very sophisticated way to listen to music. We can choose a style, a composer or a singer and listen at our own leisure. We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!"
27939,"Pandora",2014-08-14,5,"Because I like many different styles I choose several   A co-worker told me about Pandora and that I pick the style of music. Because I like many different styles I choose several. When I play the music I choose shuffle and just listen to the music. I will not hesitate recommending to anyone. Thanks for the free music."

So for that reason I Must give it 5 Stars!"
27941,"Pandora",2013-08-23,5,"I <3 Pandora!   I was hesitant at first before buying the app, but I fell in love with Pandora. I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!"

27959,"Pandora",2013-06-24,4,"Plays well, most of the time. Needs more extensive song list though.   Plays pretty well. BUt there have been several songs /artists that are far from unknown that I thought surely would be included and were not showing up at all in search! This needs improving, also on the FREE version, there seems a lot of stopping, and pausing between playing tracks. BUt hey, it is FREE so  am not really complaining. Haha!! ;o)"
27960,"Pandora",2016-10-31,3,"Three Stars   lots of advertisement and only plays a few songs of the artist's radio you choose.."
27961,"Pandora",2013-08-04,5,"The Most Amazing Music App Ever!   This is probably the best music app available today. I can listen to all my favorite stations including artists such as Lindsey Stirling, Ellie Goulding, The Script, OneRepublic, and Carrie Underwood. You can even browse genre stations too! I listen it practically every day and I always find great new songs! I highly recommend this app!"

27981,"Pandora",2013-11-21,5,"radio is not dead :)   I have loved Pandora for years, and I was so excited that I could have it on my tablet.

28057,"Pandora",2014-02-15,4,"Good Music Selection   Good music and much better selection than XMRadio.  The only draw back is the frequency that the music stops.  It is much better with a subscription as there are no commercials however it still stops playing way too often requiring restarting or notification that ""I am still listening""."
28058,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"Can't live without Pandora   I credit my genre of music range to Pandora. Absolute genius. Users complain about limited skips and I see it as a benefit - sometimes you have to listen to the whole song to relate to it. I will forever follow Pandora."
28059,"Pandora",2015-04-10,5,"I'd give it 10 stars, if I could.   It's user-friendly. And just the best thing ever.  My stations are the most diverse collection of artists you can imagine.

28406,"Pandora",2016-11-19,1,"Connection problem   On my Kindle it keeps cutting off, disconnecting from wifi."
28409,"Pandora",2015-05-25,2,"it ok   Pandora was good at one point, now every other song leads to 3 commercials and disliking a song takes 5 minutes to load, the computer version is slightly better and is way last buggy"
28410,"Pandora",2013-09-27,5,"Way better than Spotify   So far I've had this app for about a month now on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Plays in the background while I'm working other apps and is way better then Spotify. I had Spotify for a week and I hated it. Only drawback it that it drains battery power pretty fast. but I guess that's to be expected."
28413,"Pandora",2016-09-14,5,"Five Stars   Love the free streaming and the commercials don't last too painfully long!"
28415,"Pandora",2016-02-06,5,"My opinions   I can say it is great, and, then it badgreat : lets you listen to musicbad : have to have an Internet connection"
28417,"Pandora",2015-07-23,4,"Like it, but there's a few things I dislike   I like Pandora, but the only things I don't like are: 1: ADS!😠  2: KIDZ BOP (Childrens) radio ever has actual KIDZ BOP on it very much! 😑Other than that, I like it! 😊"
28419,"Pandora",2015-03-19,1,"supports Monsanto   Pandora was perfect in every way until I heard a Monsanto advertisement. I am completely against Monsanto (nothing good comes from that ugly company), I deleted Pandora. Highly disappointed. Booo."

28461,"Pandora",2016-01-11,4,"You've changed, but I still love you, Pandora.   I love Pandora, but it's a bit different from when I first started using it about two years ago. It won't play the songs I want."
28469,"Pandora",2016-08-26,5,"Five Stars   Good app I use the app when I'm at work or on the roadGood music"
28474,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"Amazing free music!!   Pandora is my most favorite music app ever, it's perfect for anyone who wants to listen to their favorite genre of music. And all you have to do is put in your favorite bands and shuffle. I love it!!"

28476,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"Fantastic Music for Any Mood   Pandora is my go-to music any time of the day.  Have decided to upgrade to no commercial status for a nominal $5/month."
28478,"Pandora",2017-01-30,5,"Enjoyment.   So much variety to choose from & listen to.bright"
28486,"Pandora",2016-04-25,4,"I love Pandora and stream music when I'm golfing with friends   I love Pandora and stream music when I'm golfing with friends.  I wish the ad free version wasn't extra."
28487,"Pandora",2014-01-13,1,"disappointed.   I have had this App before in my phone and it worked good but I.couldn't keep it cause I didn't have the data to run it as much as I wanted now I have a Kindle Fire that I run on WiFi 24/7 but I can never get Pandora to work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Very disappointed!"
28495,"Pandora",2015-12-04,5,"Wow, Pandora   This is the best music site I have ever seen. I can create my own radio stations, just by entering in my favourite artists. I am amazed."
28496,"Pandora",2016-07-07,5,"Five Stars   My co-workers listen to the same stuff all the time so Pandora is a sanity saver for me"
28501,"Pandora",2015-05-15,5,"Five Stars   cannot live without it. I have Pandora on every device ithat I own."
28503,"Pandora",2014-02-11,5,"Pandora   I chose this rating because i love this app. What i like about this app is that i can listen to all the music i like and i can have as many stations as i want there's no limit and also that i can put all my music on shuffle. I recommend this app to everyone its a great app."
28505,"Pandora",2013-07-26,1,"Am I missing something?   I can't log in with my facebook account like I can online. I've tried entering the same log in info as my fb and there is no option to log in with fb. I tried to make a new account using the same email that I use for fb and it told me my email was taken. Am I just missing something here? This is so frustrating!"
28512,"Pandora",2016-09-17,5,"Five Stars   Better than FM and does not charge a monthly fee like satellite radio."
28515,"Pandora",2013-01-28,5,"Love Pandora!   Use Pandora all the time.Considering getting the paid version, less/no advertising.Even though I could get my satellite radio providers service, Pandora is better because you can control what you want to listen to vs having to listen to what is being broadcast at the time.  Pandora has more options and works for me and my family!"
28522,"Pandora",2017-05-24,5,"Don't miss Pandora.   You'd be crazy not to love Pandora"
28525,"Pandora",2016-12-21,5,"Five Stars   Very impressed with all the choices and clarity."
28527,"Pandora",2016-07-02,4,"Overall I love it   I really don't like the ads. There will be ads telling me about the ""ad free"" listening I'm taking part in and I'm sure I don't have to explain why this irks me. There are also ads almost every time I skip a song or switch stations. Otherwise I love this app.  I have a station for pretty much any mood I have and a variety to cover whatever else I'd enjoy hearing. Favorite part is it's free. I won't pay for the ad free, I just turn it down or tune it out."
28530,"Pandora",2016-01-04,5,"Love It   This is the only app that will play over my other apps, is really nice when i want to listen to music and read at the same time."
28532,"Pandora",2013-10-20,5,"I like being able to pick and choose my music this site give me that choice.   Five stars easy, the music and other programs offered on Pandora are what I enjoy listening too. Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing. Pandora  is good listening and I really don't mind the comms that are a part of the free programing either.Bill"
28533,"Pandora",2017-01-02,5,"Pandora an awesome app You will love it   I LOVE PANDORA!! A must have when you love music like I do"
28534,"Pandora",2014-12-18,5,"Good quality and extensive playlists   A great streaming service.  I don't all the commercials, but I suppose I should just bite the bullet and pay for the premium subscription.  Great playlists."
28537,"Pandora",2016-07-29,5,"I Love Tjis Music App   If you like music as much as I do and you cant live without it than this is the app for you it has every song you. could ever imagine. And you can also set alarm clocks so this is how I walk up to go to school."
28539,"Pandora",2017-10-23,5,"Five Stars   AAA+++"
28542,"Pandora",2013-05-06,1,"Pandora -- not user friendly   I downloaded and installed Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I created a station and everything seemed to work fine. However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE."
28543,"Pandora",2016-10-09,5,"Five Stars   i love it, can get all the really old songs , i am in 7th heaven"
28546,"Pandora",2014-03-07,5,"It still great even if you don't pay   Pandora is amazing even with the fact if you skip a song you don't like it play a short ad but hey maybe those song might actually be good. The best is that is got me to try new bands I would have skip otherwise because I just never stop and listen so it great for just that."
28548,"Pandora",2014-04-10,3,"You can't pick songs.   Good sounding music but you can't search for music you want to hear and play it.  You just put in a group or song and than they choose to play music that sounds similar to the group or song you entered earlier.  Also you can't record what you are listening to.."
28549,"Pandora",2016-12-29,5,"Five Stars   Awesome"

You can type up any type of music, song, or artist you like and it will bring it up. I recommend this for everyone. :)"
28564,"Pandora",2016-03-21,2,"Used to work   Doesn't work with the new update. It won't open. I like Pandora. I just wished they fix it so it works again."
28571,"Pandora",2015-12-18,5,"This is the best site for music I love that I can listen ...   This is the best site for music  I love that I can listen to the music I prefer without having to sit through some horrible tunes."

28598,"Pandora",2014-09-01,4,"I have only been using the application for a few ...   I have only been using the application for a few days, but so far I am impressed. The ability to create a ""radio station"" based on a particular artist is very intuitive, and the lyrics and notes are a interesting addition."
28601,"Pandora",2016-08-10,3,"Three Stars   I'm still having problem getting other music. The web need to be simplified."
28604,"Pandora",2015-11-23,5,"love it   I love Pandora. It's a great option when you don't really want to think about what to listen to but want to listen to some great music."
28608,"Pandora",2017-02-07,5,"Love listening to my music from Pandora on the echo.   I have enjoyed Pandora on my IPad for about 5 years. Love that you can pick your own music, pick different artists or genre and play it on shuffle. Now that I have the echo I can listen to it on that, and the best part, it is free."
28613,"Pandora",2014-04-15,5,"It's all there for the asking...   At first, I thought Pandora was okay, pretty good music, infrequent, brief commercials, and free.  Then I started to work on it, adding artists until I have the most amazingly eclectic mix of country rock, blues, jazz, Grateful Dead, Beach Boys, and it's still free. Only thing, once in a while, I'll get some schwilly Christmas song dropped in - yo9u have to be sure to exercise the thumbs down if you don't like something.  For me, Pandora is just the best!"
28615,"Pandora",2017-05-24,5,"Five Stars   Pandora has all the great music"

28623,"Pandora",2014-01-26,5,"Very Nice!   I really like using Pandora, especially when I don't know exactly what I want to listen to. I'm able to play the songs and styles I like, discard what I don't like or am not in the mood for. Pandora then plays songs and styles that I like, and the choice to skip or listen."
28629,"Pandora",2016-07-24,5,"Five Stars   The best radio app ever... It plays all your likes would not ever stop using it"
28635,"Pandora",2014-09-12,5,"Great Music!   I love that I get to listen to any kind of music and all of my favorite artists! It's not boring like the radio station in the car that is always playing the same thing, day in and day out until another artist releases a song!"
28640,"Pandora",2017-06-21,1,"One Star   not cheap enough"
28644,"Pandora",2013-10-22,5,"the plus of pandora   this is really a plus for me i can have pandora in one rooom and slacker radio on in another room. it depends on my busy schedule. i cant jump from beyonce to brenda russell going into  the different areas of my home and thats what keeps me going. music is everything and makes my day flow."
28648,"Pandora",2014-12-27,5,"Pandora for Kindle Fire HDX   Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HDX so we could have some back ground holiday music when we were having Xmas morning breakfast.  Worked well, easy to find some Holiday Music Channels....what can I say."

28831,"Pandora",2013-03-03,5,"Great for music lovers   I found pandora years ago with some coworkers who used it. I love the fact you can create stations that play the similar kinds of music. It doesn't always get it right if you pick more obscure music, but anything mainstream it picks simiar music. I introduced my wife first to it a year ago and she uses it all the time now."

So I feel slightly guilty listening... just slightly even though the commercial breaks are to my taste better than the usual ones... No Fund Drives either unlike the ""Commercial"" Stations or Public Radio that always hit between SSI checksGreat feature would be a senior account, Howeveri can see no way to void the inevitable fraud that is going to appear...

28985,"Pandora",2012-09-28,5,"Awesome   I have no idea why everyone doesn't use this. It's an amazing way to create your own radio station. Far fewer commercials that traditional radio. You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you've never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that aren't played on the radio very often anymore."

29005,"Pandora",2014-01-18,2,"After the love has gone....   When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling.  You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of.  You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact.  You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to.  You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening!  You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true?  Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on?  You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations.  So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together.  You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret.  Why? Why Pandora Why?"

29021,"Pandora",2014-03-27,3,"A little more annoying then useful   I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."
29024,"Pandora",2013-04-04,5,"What did we do before Pandora!   This is an amazing service - You are not limited to a certain style of music and have virtually every type of music at your finger tips - Therefore Pandora is suitable for any age group or taste in music. . .

29060,"Pandora",2012-12-20,4,"Great app   I love using Pandora. The only problem I have with this app is: I haven't found a way to scroll back through previously played music to rate like or dislike. I would like that option because I like to turn it on and just let it play while I cook or clean. The more you like or dislike a song, the more Pandora learns your style."

Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

I started subscribing to Pandora when I had a birthday party coming up and I didn't want to go over thinking of what kind of songs I could play. I just put Pandora on and just kept on going with it all day I didn't have to worry about it. I did have to adjust the time it goes to sleep so that so I wouldn't have to be coming back every 20 minutes to click that I was still listening."

You can pick as many as you like.  And the really neat part, is that if a song comes on and you don't like it you can ""thumbs down"" it and it will never play it again!!  If you just don't feel like hearing a song  at that time you hit another key and it will skip to the next selection but will play it again some time. It is a wonderful thing to have!!"

29600,"Pandora",2014-04-07,1,"Serious problem with Kindle Fire HDX after installing Pandora   I don't install that many apps on my Kindle.  (I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything.  I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer.  I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened.  I assumed the battery was drained.  I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else.  I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes.  Then I tried opening it.  Nothing.  I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime.  I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared.  The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle.  Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared.  I entered my PIN, nothing.  Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked.  I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora.  I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal.  I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network.  I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."

You should offer a option when selected only plays that artist on a play list. Meaning if someone wants to hear Michael Jackson thats the only artist that plays. Thats one thing I don't like. When hearing the artist I selected, I really don't want to hear another artist mixed in with my selected artist. I think that would be a great option."

31414,"Pandora",2013-09-23,1,"Was 5 star, now not so much   This app used to work flawlessly. Now with version 4.5 it hangs on startup about 50% of the time on my Kindle Fire HD. Two stars.UPDATE 10/20/14: Ads have become progressively more obnoxious and intrusive. Today I had one lock up the entire Kindle - I couldn't even power it down. One star - unacceptable. Tried to uninstall and even that failed."

31452,"Pandora",2014-05-24,3,"Eh...   Well you can hear the music fine but what I don't like is that I can't search a song for it to play. It also needs to have a loop button so you can listen to a song more than once."
31453,"Pandora",2016-08-22,3,"Three Stars   thank you"
31454,"Pandora",2014-01-03,5,"It's Pandora...   I've been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
31456,"Pandora",2013-02-11,5,"wonderful streaming   Always user friendly. Wonderful music I couldn't choose it so well for myself if I tried. Pandora introduces me to new artists and songs, and I soon becoming a great fan and end up purchasing their music as well. Pandora truly is background music for your life!"
31458,"Pandora",2013-04-05,3,"I definitively like iheart much better.   Great music,but it has a very generic feel to it. I feel iheart has more features I like.The only reason I have Pandora is because iheart crashed on me and I couldn't get it up back and running."

31510,"Pandora",2014-11-25,5,"I enjoyed it from start to finish   If this is a referral for Pandora by Anne Rice, then I definitely give it 5 stars.  Pandora describes the life of a Roman woman of the upper class 2000 years ago.  It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Pandora is one of Anne's vampire books but like all her vampire books, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities."
31514,"Pandora",2016-02-23,5,"Variety is Great   I have been using Pandora for years now.  I listen to it at work and home.  One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity.  It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting.  I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office.  But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down.  Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."
31523,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"Pandora, YES!   I absolutely enjoy it and have for years. Thank you!"

31850,"Pandora",2014-03-25,5,"Glad I got it   I've been hearing about Pandora, but thought it was one of those satillite radio things that were super expensive and kind of a waste of time, especially in an age of downloading music. Well I recently have become addicted to various styles of Gregorian Chant music to help me relax & meditate and found Pandora to have the best selctions. Plus, it being a free app to download I thought ""why not?"". Love this app; definately recommend for anyone looking for that hard to find sound in a sea of contemporary music."

32445,"Pandora",2014-03-28,5,"streaming audio wow   Create and customize your own radio station, or choose one their existing channels.  Create several channels, to choose from depending on your mood or the company you have."
32448,"Pandora",2013-08-10,5,"Nice very nice   Even with the ads this is a gem.  I can select my artist and it will bring up songs by that artist and others from the same genre.  I can click on a dislike and never get that artist again.  Plays while using other apps."
32450,"Pandora",2014-02-17,4,"just beautiful   I typed in Josh Grobin and I  can listen to the selection of music for hours.  I haven't quite decided if I want to subscribe yet ( and pay the fee)but I might do that soon."

So whether I need energetic beats to clean the house, holiday tunes to set the mood, or calming music in the hectic workplace...Pandora is my top choice!"
32461,"Pandora",2012-11-13,4,"Like it   Not bad for a radio app. Plays music I haven't heard in years. it's not Spotify but since I can't get it on my tablet Pandora will do. The one thing I dislike is I can only skip 6 time in any given hour so I just change thru my song list to switch songs."
32462,"Pandora",2015-10-17,3,"fantastic on kindle, awful on tv   This app is great when I want not-awful music to listen to, when I want to have control over the sort of thing I want to listen to but have no idea what it is exactly what I want.But it is terrible on the newest fire tv. It takes at least five minutes to load a song, something I thought was a fluke when I first installed it on the Fire tv but seems to be literally every time. Still works fine on my kindle and laptop and phone and that's why its still got three wtaes, but goodness it's awful on the Fire tv (which I give a resounding no-star review for). I hope that's fixed soon."
32464,"Pandora",2016-01-23,5,"Five Stars   Its Pandora- what else is there to say"

32495,"Pandora",2015-03-02,4,"It's fine but...   Choices like ""The Beatles Station"" should be ALL Beatles, not a mix of artists. Otherwise it's okay"
32498,"Pandora",2016-02-12,1,"will not play music.   Fix it and I'll change my review."

32501,"Pandora",2016-03-10,5,"Five Stars   Cant live without Pandora !"
32502,"Pandora",2013-09-15,5,"Great source for free music   Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better!In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"
32503,"Pandora",2014-11-23,5,"love it!!   enjoy the music. easy to start stations. the price is free. ads are very few and not distracting. well worth getting the app."

33380,"Pandora",2013-07-27,3,"good but...   It works as it's supposed to but after a while it turns black and I have to quit the app and start over. Sometimes it doesn't start up at all. So when is the update coming out? Thanks for your time."
33382,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Pandora ""Box"" is great   I have Pandora installed on my older model computer and had trouble with smooth streaming.  With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear.  I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"".  After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre.  If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station.""  If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc.  Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora."
33392,"Pandora",2013-09-18,3,"everyone knows about Pandora by now...   I give it 3 stars because the music and playlists are good but the commercials are terrible! You can download other apps that don't have any commercials that are just as good if not better."

33412,"Pandora",2013-12-01,5,"Pandora rocks   With Pandora's personal playlist, I never get bored or tired of the same old songs.  I get to hear my favorites alongside new music and obscure artists not played on the radio."

The Alexa Pandora integration is a little more strict than it is with other products. Commands have to be exact with no variance or it will not understand.

34993,"Pandora",2014-05-19,4,"A great app   This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I look on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I look at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It doesn't seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have."
34996,"Pandora",2014-01-16,5,"Now it's my turn to hear what I want   I can play wheat I want to hear on my tablet and download a mix of songs I like to hear.  I put my headphones on and clean to the music I want."

35003,"Pandora",2013-06-12,5,"Great music app for the undecided listener.   Pandora is great for those that can't decide exactly what they want to listen to. Just type in an artist and it will play that artist along with others in similar genres or bands."
35005,"Pandora",2015-10-18,5,"Easy listening   Pandora is the best!"
35006,"Pandora",2014-03-19,4,"It is fun to explore music and to animate the computer time   So the variety is good. I just have to figure out if I can stand the ads. The visual ones are o.k. but the spoken ones are annoying."
35007,"Pandora",2015-12-03,5,"Five Stars   great deal"

However, they let so many violent and pro-rape tracks slip through the cracks. I wrote to them, and, of course, the representative had to defend free speech and their policy on their ""comedy"" selection.

35794,"Pandora",2013-05-27,3,"Pandora Was My Favorite, Edited Songs, Limited Library, Repeat Songs   I have used Pandora since around 2006. It seemed at that time (in my experience)Pandora was one of the only services offering free streaming of music based on user input. I have Pandora One and I am disappointed that despite changing my settings to allow explicit content many of the songs are edited. It seems that the same songs are played several times over, even within a few hours. I still use Pandora Radio but I am losing enthusiasm fast. There are now many other similar services that offer a much greater selection of songs. I have tried several of the other services and the music has much more variety on many of the other services._Bottom Line_ I would carefully compare all services before committing to one. There are now so many to choose from and each service has its limitations. Each service also has its perks too. Do some research and find out what fits best. Yes, I still recommend Pandora Radio to friends but I no longer recommend paying for the service. This review is based on my own opinion, individual experience, and style. I do not believe this is a one size fits all."

I love Pandora, and have been using it for many years - this is the first year I've had a tablet and was very exciting to discover Pandora. Artists, Songs, Genres are easy to find and use - especially for those of us who are technically-challenged. My little complaint is that I can't always ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" a song...what is equally nice and sometimes frustrating, is this app allows you to listen to music while doing other things on your tablet. Minor quirks aside - I'm very happy with this app and would recommend to anyone!"

This rating is for the application only.  I suspect those wanting to get this application already know about Pandora, they don't need me to rate the website.My wife enjoys this application more than I do since she's the one with the Pandora account.  She's able to listen to her Pandora music even while she uses her Kindle to read a book.  I would have been happy if this app had to open with no other app running, providing it worked.  But this app goes beyond and has earned the 5 star rating hands down.  My wife is VERY happy with this app.Works well on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9."

When you pick specific artists and create stations it does a good job at playing music in that same genre. I have used this app faithfully for years. The thumbs up and down option is great for customizing the station even more to your own personal liking. It keeps songs you really like replaying in the mix without over playing them. But, also adds new songs to the mix as well."

36558,"Pandora",2013-12-15,5,"So good I listen for hours   I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life.  That sounds melodramatic but it's true.  I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds.  I'm living on a shoestring.  And I live way out in the sticks.  There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here.  On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music.  The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano.  I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied.  Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me.  That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate.  I took the upgrade right away - it's an inexpensive way to get rid of ads."

I have added many channels that feature artist/groups that I learned about on Pandora. I have Pandora One which for $ 4.99 a month keeps me up with the new music that is out there. This is really great when you around younger people and you name groups that they all like....hmmm keeps me young and is saying ""Cool"" still Cool?

You can also give a ""thumbs up"" to a particular singer or song and it will add it up to your collection of favorites. It will also play similar music to the ones chosen. I am very happy to listen to this free radio medium as the reception is good. Pandora was recommended by various friends, and I will certainly will recommend it to other people."

37377,"Pandora",2016-05-06,5,"The ONLY way we listen to our 🎶!!   Nothing better than this app for music!  I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy,  playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay!  Download today!  Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)"

That is... the free version It has it's pros and cons as far as playing a song you dislike repeatedly over several similar stations  but is still good at introducing new artists. I've noticed that the commercials play more often than they used to and it is getting to the point where I'm starting to be annoyed by it, especially since it's the same commercial over and over and over again."

38385,"Pandora",2014-01-06,2,"good music, but crappy glitches   I like the music, it plays a lot of good songs. But for me there are three major glitches to work out.1.) It won't let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.2.) Half the time it won't let me listen to music, it'll say that it can't find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and hasn't gotten any better, it's done that to me very time this week I've tried to listen.3.) When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.So Pandora, I'm willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I won't go any higher than that because of the glitches, I'd appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

38724,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Great ap for selecting the music you like and deleting the music you don't. Wide variety of music choices.   Wonderful choice of on-line music that allows you to add favorites to your playlist and delete forever songs that you don't like.This is a wonderful choice for those who do not want to listen to secular music with bad language and adult themes but get tired of listening to Christian radio and limited song choices.It's free to use and you can customize, see lyrics and select the music you want to hear. It really does not get much better.We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently, but for a free service, it is well worth it.It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list."

39240,"Pandora",2011-10-16,5,"Great app   Don't judge an app by international licensing laws that don't allow Pandora to stream overseas. I would imagine Pandora would love to stream outside the US. With that said, the app works as advertised."

39266,"Pandora",2014-12-11,5,"Five Stars   gives me all the music I want"
39269,"Pandora",2013-09-20,4,"How did it know that?   It's very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it's best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. What's really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and don't like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste.  I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I'm really amazed at how well it works.On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app."

I used to use an online station called shoutcast and it was awesome, completely free and no advertisements. Pandora follows the free to play model where you get a decent taste with the free version but frustrating enough that your basically forced to get the paid version."

40340,"Pandora",2014-03-16,3,"Panadora - first tablet purchased   Pandora worked out of the box, but I found the instructions to be unclear.  Example, when I accidently bypassed the correct 'time' setting, it took me 2 days and hours of internet research to find how to reset.  Seems to me there should be an instruction booklet with the unit.  It is different that the computer I've used for years, and trying to use the on-line guide is a bit cumbersome. It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however."

If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."

They are now some of my favorite singers. The only problem are the ads. They aren't super bad, it's just that they happen at all. It's just a commercial off and on, or ""tap the banner below to go to blah blah blah "".My advice : just don't skip every single song. It makes more commercials! Also, when you skip, you eventually use up all your skips for an hour. Other than that, it's a great app!"

I subscribe to Pandora radio...but I subscribed through GooglePlay 6 months ago.I downloaded the app onto my new Kindle..logged in...and no music.It shows the album art and everything like normal....but not a sound. Maybe because I originally got it through Google??  This is not cool.I'm starting to see this Kindle as a waste of $$ and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon. My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it won't play on this thing."

41514,"Pandora",2013-10-25,3,"Good, but extremely glitched   I love Pandora, and this app is no exception. It is great to be able to just log in and have a personalized radio. It also exposes you to different music that you would have never thought of listening to. However, that's only when it works. Unfortunately, this app very rarely functions properly on my Kindle Fire HD. It often freezes up, and refuses to do anything except close, and it is also prone to just completely not opening. It is ridiculously annoying. But still, it is a great app, when it works."

I also like the fact that if I don't like a particular song or if I am tired of listening to certain songs, I can give them a thumbs done and I won't hear them again... I have had Pandora on my computer for awhile and I love it. However, when I am away from my computer, I didn't have it because I had an older phone. So, I upgraded my phone to a smart phone and now I get to listen to Pandora whenever I want !!! Yipee !!!"

41941,"Pandora",2012-01-01,5,"Best Streaming Music Player Out There   I use this on my android tablets and Computers. Absolutely Awesome! Highly recommend for all platforms. Uses very small memory foot print."
41944,"Pandora",2013-06-26,4,"Like It a Lot   I've been a Pandora subscriber for about 2 years.  For me, it's well worth paying for and it's taken the place of our defunct stereo system.  I don't use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music.  I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group.  Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to.  The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music.  Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.  I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that doesn't work for me.  So far, It's a perfect solution for me."
41948,"Pandora",2015-12-01,1,"Not working   Pandora works great on everything except my new amazon fire tablets. I bought 2 tablets and neither have sound when running Pandora. It's the only program that does not work. Amazon fire only. Program runs, shows a song is playing, progression bar does not move, no sound on tablet. 1 star only for fire tablet. 5 stars on any other device."
41954,"Pandora",2015-08-25,4,"not very adept at it but easy to set up   needed a source of background music in my living room....not very adept at it but easy to set up. Will stop and ask if I'm still listening and occasionally run an advertisement and seems to make assumptions about the type of music I want, but seldom runs anything I don't like."

41982,"Pandora",2016-02-11,1,"STUPID   When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001% of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes. I really love Nightcore and Meghan Trainor Radio but I can't listen to it with all of this happening. 😩😩😩😩😩. Please fix it and I will raise my rating. Thank you!"
41983,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"love it   Its a great song app. Love the fact I can choose a station to listen to and its a great selection."
41986,"Pandora",2012-12-09,5,"Pandora   I love this product. I have it on m home computer, my iPhone, my iPad and my Kindle. Love it."
41987,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"TERRIBLE for Kindle Fire HD, works on other Android tablets   I use Pandora often on my computer, so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire HD and my daughters' tablets.  While it works fine on the Android tablets, Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire.  It takes forever to load (and usually multiple tries); it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs, and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well, when I try to turn Pandora off it won't shut off.  I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire.  Two stars because it does, in fact, work on other tablets.  DO NOT get the app if you have a Kindle."
41988,"Pandora",2016-11-14,5,"If you like your music everywhere you go without taking up your ...   If you like your music everywhere you go without taking up your memory or carrying extra music devices, then Pandora is the way to go!"

41992,"Pandora",2012-12-09,4,"Awesome   I listen to all the time and its like having your very own DJ.  I am very pleased with it!"
41993,"Pandora",2015-08-06,5,"Pandora ROCKS!   Have been listening to Pandora for years. I love that I can plug in a 'vibe' I want and get all kinds of music I've never heard of. Have used it for Halloween parties, holiday get-togethers, and my go-to station for work is one of my favorite motion picture score composers. I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I don't mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials. Love that I can listen to Pandora on my Kindle while reading, I can access it on my iPad while working out, and I can bluetooth-stream it through my car. I'm always just a click away from my favorite music!"
41996,"Pandora",2016-05-02,4,"Won't Accept me Signing Up!!!   So, I got this app and signed up. After I entered my info, it wouldn't let me sign up! I tried new passwords, but to no avail! What exactly could be the problem? I am familiar with Pandora and I think it's an awesome app, so I'm giving it a four star rating because it's awesome, but won't let me sign up!"
41997,"Pandora",2017-06-12,4,"Ive gone back to Pandora   I've moved back to pandora from Spotify due to increased music selection. could and probably will get better"
42000,"Pandora",2012-12-09,2,"Too many ads   Tried it but had too many ads.  Skip a song or two and more ads come.  Removed in a day."
42006,"Pandora",2011-11-19,5,"love Pandora   Pandora is the perfect radio station.  Having it on your phone is even better.  And the price was perfect!  Get it for your Android."
42007,"Pandora",2013-01-16,5,"Never knew about it   A friend of mine had this app on her phone and I didn't even know what it was. I thought it was awesome and downloaded it onto my kindle.  Very neat and easily able to be customized."

42015,"Pandora",2012-09-06,5,"must have   A must  have for anyone that loves music, or for any one who likes to  make  the time past better."
42021,"Pandora",2016-05-15,4,"Pandora Music Service   Pandora is a great music service. Free version of App has minimal commercials. Primarily interruption free listening. Create account, preferences, get recommended music. Account accessible from any device. Listen anywhere. Definitely would download again."
42022,"Pandora",2014-04-12,3,"Interesting concept   The obvious good is that I get to choose which songs I want and I can create several different stations for different types of music.  The part I don't like is that it seems to want me to continuously interact with it to tell it what I like and don't like.  It also tests my patience by throwing in songs that I do not want.  I don't want a radio station that I have to babysit.  I prefer music to just ""be on"" in the background.  The best time to set up a Pandora account is on a long car trip, so that I had several hours to fine-tune my stations."
42032,"Pandora",2013-01-25,3,"Not the best version   It plays well but I feel limited in how it plays. The screen is clear but not easy to use."
42045,"Pandora",2016-09-28,5,"Five Stars   I like the fact I'm able to pick the songs i like"
42050,"Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly   Pandora used to have a nice interface.  Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed.  You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program.  It doesn't support the menu button.  It turns on and off randomly, so you can't let it idle in the background.  Perfect,  now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car,  leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and  blare music.  When I'm  in a meeting or library.  Awesome.... Fix your app,  Pandora.  There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance.  I know that I would never pay for premium  these issues."
42052,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"Dont like their official app   Too many ads"
42053,"Pandora",2013-09-06,5,"Free music   I use al the time instead of playing my radio at home and in the car. This app is a must have."
42055,"Pandora",2016-09-04,5,"Great   Love this! However, too many and too long pauses. Guess I'm having trouble with streaming. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
42056,"Pandora",2012-02-24,5,"got the droid x update   Got the droid x update and now it doesn't shut down on me anymore! Love it! Works better than slacker imo"
42060,"Pandora",2015-09-03,1,"No Remedy   Worked great for 4 months, but now will not play at all!  This is the second phone (HTC ONE M9) that this has happened to. The other phone was a Galaxy S4, the situation could never be resolved on that phone either. I have been a paying subscriber for a long time now, but that ends today. Too many people have the same problem as I do and Pandora's solution does not work. I hate to say goodbye to Pandora but I don't feel that I have any choice. Thank you."

It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go.

42078,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"Could always be better   I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."

42091,"Pandora",2016-12-16,1,"Alarm clock feature broken   Whether it's Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."

A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time.  Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode --  helps save on the battery.  It also doesn't seem to interfere with the other applications -- although it will occasionally distort slightly (not all the time) when performing certain actions on a game or pulling up e-mail."

I really do like the different genres for music.  The music really sounds good on the Kindle Fire HD, because of the dolby audio sound system.  I could listen to it all day long.  I would and have recommended it to friends."

They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great  was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."

I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste."

I knew Pandora was available online, but I was delighted to find an app for it that works with my KindleFire. The sound is incredible. This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-book or surfing the web.  I program only the types of music that I want to hear and it provides the lyrics to most songs, allowing you to become familiar with the artists, the titles and the albums of the songs you are hearing for future purchase, if you so choose."

At some point in your session you'll end up hearing rap or some completely different artist than the one you specifically went to a radio for"

42150,"Pandora",2013-02-23,5,"Pandora App   OMG!  I got rid of my smart phone due to the cost.  My boyfriend and I were talking about music. He said how much he loves Pandora.

42154,"Pandora",2017-01-15,4,"Pandora   Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad, but it doesn't repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group."
42156,"Pandora",2017-05-23,2,"Frustrating   Can only get one song to play before Pandora freezes."
42157,"Pandora",2011-12-31,3,"Pandora NO TuneIn YES   A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try.  It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)Why?First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSICJust sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right?  That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is.  Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, CajunYUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right?  WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world.  Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and  - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"".  Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied!  But wait?  What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257""  Wait??  You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback.  TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."
42160,"Pandora",2013-01-22,4,"only one minor problem   Pandora is free, it's great for finding new music in a particular genre.  The only problem is, it keeps playing after you exit the app,  That's great if you want music while you work on other things, but not so great if you do not,  I cannot find any way to shut it off other than turning the whole Kindle off."

It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can't hardly go wrong with this one. :P"

42349,"Pandora",2014-05-28,5,"Why did I wait??   Having known about Pandora since it's inception I am wondering now why I waited so long to install it on my phone. It is absolutely a wonderful way to listen to your favorites but, more importantly, discover some new ones."
42366,"Pandora",2012-12-14,1,"Not a good app.   The app constantly stops playing music. It will play a few songs and stop, usually when an ad pops up. You can purchase the ad free app though, but I haven't so not sure how well that works. I have talked to several others and they have had this same problem with the Pandora app. Not enjoyable"
42367,"Pandora",2016-07-28,5,"Five Stars   Love this app I use it all the time"
42373,"Pandora",2013-08-21,1,"Won't open   After looking at all the good reviews for this app, I decided to get it. Unfortunately, it wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire HD. It just stayed on the blue Pandora screen. Any way to fix this and I will buy it again."
42374,"Pandora",2013-11-19,1,"Pandora doesn't work   I have herd that you can listen to any music on this app but mine wont work for me. I have a kindle and an iPod and on both it wont work. On my kindle fire it worked but when i wanted to change the song my whole kindle crashed. On my iPod i cant create or log in to my account."
42375,"Pandora",2015-02-18,4,"half music, half silence   It will play a song of two, then go quiet for five to ten minutes. Then it will play a commercial, then start over again. It's very agitating. I tried to contract Pandora to fix the problem and never got a response. I've uninstalled it, the reinstalled it; it didn't work."
42376,"Pandora",2013-04-12,1,"changed permissions   So Pandora did an update and they can now access my contacts and send them emails without my permission. I loved Pandora but I will not risk them sending stuff to my many contacts especially since a lot if them are professional contacts. Goodbye Pandora. Looking for something else now."
42380,"Pandora",2014-02-09,1,"Pandora = Awesome   Pandora must be in the habit of spoofing reviews of itself. I never signed up for this, never created an acount, have never and will never, ever use it, and do not wish to be included with anyone who thinks Pandora is anything worth having.I am ready to sever all ties with Amazon if Pandora comes along with it. BUYER BEWARE,!!"
42384,"Pandora",2013-08-30,1,"Fix the Update   This was my favorite app until the latest update. Now it won't even start on my Kindle and if it does, it locks up after just a few songs or if I change the channel.  I am a paying customer and deserve to have what I pay for.  Can't even figure out how to stop my subscription."
42385,"Pandora",2014-03-02,3,"Very good, BUT   Pretty good music selection as others have noted. My concerns are operational controls that are weak or lacking on my Nexus 7.1 Android tablet.When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back. The big reason I miss the sleep timer is because when I am drowsey and want to turn Pandora off I have to almost wake up because of no quick way to shut  Pandora off. It requires a bunch of taps to turn off. Where oh where is my sleep timer for my android tablet????"
42388,"Pandora",2013-01-01,1,"Never arrived   I Got this programfrom nt computer on Sunday night and as Tues night I have yet to see it on my Kindle, I like it on my computer just did not think that it would take so long to down load."
42391,"Pandora",2013-10-22,3,"glitchy at times.   True. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I'm using a kindle fire hd. When it does work it's great and performs top notch. When it doesn't it sits at the intro screen and when you try to 're open it, it flashes and closes. Is this a bug? If yes, then needs an update."
42392,"Pandora",2017-03-20,5,"Good product!   Good  product!"
42393,"Pandora",2017-03-18,5,"Love!   Love Pandora!"
42399,"Pandora",2016-07-18,2,"Ads ads ads   Too many ads, ads are too long, and I wish I had the ability to opt out of live performances. Hearing people scream ""WOOO"" the entire song isn't exactly pleasurable."
42401,"Pandora",2012-12-17,4,"Too many commercials   Yes, I know, that's how they pay for things. But come on, commercials every third song or so? Wow. I remember using Pandora years ago on my computer - it wasn't that bad."
42405,"Pandora",2014-01-21,1,"doesn't stay on   After one song it stops playing. This is very annoying when I'm doing my hair or anything else were I have to walk away from my kindle. Even after I change my awake time to 15 minutes it still stops after one song until I unlock my kindle. Please get this fixed"
42409,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Great app - listen to it all the time.   I really like this app.  I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money.  I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home.  At home, I connect to a bluetooth speaker.  When a call comes in, the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again.  Unlimited music selection."
42413,"Pandora",2016-06-25,3,"Why you are in politics?   The reason that I am not giving five stars is that Pandora is restricted to some people in some other countrys.This is a music Media not a political establishemnt."
42414,"Pandora",2013-02-23,5,"awesome classic rock   Was sent an intro by my Sister. Signed up for free trial. Awesome tracks. Brings back the old days.May consider the monthly subscription somtime in the future."
42418,"Pandora",2015-09-06,5,"love it   I love it you get free music but there's only one thing i hate you need Wi-Fi it drives me crazy because at my house we dont got Wi-Fi but on the way to school i use the Wi-Fi my bus driver has but any way great app it has all the music u ask for get it its great"
42423,"Pandora",2017-01-18,5,"I love Pandora.   I love Pandora...use it on computer at home and work....as well as my phone.  It is the best.  I am always at my ""100"" stations allowed because with just a couple of exceptions, I like all music from the 1940's - present.  LOVE IT"
42428,"Pandora",2014-09-06,4,"pretty good app   good for listening to music"
42429,"Pandora",2016-07-26,5,"What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ...   What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ever you go. My favorite thing about it is that if you enter a statement nag or group, it can introduce you to new music."
42432,"Pandora",2017-08-17,4,"Four Stars   Good"
42434,"Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"Pandora   Great program.  So easy to use and no download time.  I can get almost any music I desire and have the music playing in the background while I'm working."
42435,"Pandora",2013-08-31,5,"lots of fun   this definitely has every song on it that you can possibly think of... except for dave chappell which sucks. i listen to it all day at work, but be prepared for it to almost immediately drain the battery of any device that you are using to listen to it."
42436,"Pandora",2013-02-06,1,"Bought but   I purchased this app so I could listen to free music. But I can't find it or figure out how to download it.  Reply.  Ok. Your tech guy helped. Thanks."
42441,"Pandora",2013-09-01,1,"Removed from my Kendle   I was unable to do anything with it.  I downloaded it and could not open it to use.  I would not recommend it to anyone."
42452,"Pandora",2016-01-29,1,"I have lost my patience with it.   I loved Pandora, but lately it hasn't been playing properly. I'll pick a station and it'll work, eventually, but as soon as I change stations it won't play anything. I've had this problem on multiple Android phones and my Kindle Fire tablet. I will be uninstalling this app and going to IHeartRadio."
42454,"Pandora",2017-06-14,1,"Signing on should be easier   Disappointed on the difficulty to obtain password.I have Pandora on my phone and find it enjoyable;however what a pain to get it hooked up on the Kindle Fire"
42455,"Pandora",2013-02-22,5,"love the choices   this has many types of music to listen to and is fairly easy to use.  i am only an occasional listener so the free program was right for me."
42458,"Pandora",2017-07-19,1,"Couldn't download.   I couldn't download Pandora. I like I Heart Radio better, anyway."
42459,"Pandora",2016-02-21,1,"Terrible Support   Stops playing randomly. Support is terrible"

42466,"Pandora",2013-02-08,5,"great source of music   Good app even with the music. Also you don't PAY money for the music but I loved it especial y with the choice and creating radio stations"
42468,"Pandora",2014-05-27,1,"Is this really necessary?   Why does it need permission to do or change just about everything on my phone? Cut some of the unnecessary permissions and I'll use you again!"
42474,"Pandora",2013-04-06,2,"Not what I wanted   My problem with Pandora was that I wanted specific artists.  Pandora only offers a specific genre.  Not what I was looking for."
42477,"Pandora",2013-04-17,5,"WHAT CAN YOU SAY.....   Best product EVER.  If you love music, any kind of music, you must have Pandora.  We have it playing every evening at dinner.  Soft music, K Gee mostly, is our favorite.  Southern Gospel is great and I could go on and on.  GREAT...R. Hobbs"

42487,"Pandora",2013-10-12,1,"not working on kindle fire hd   Just downloaded this app and it will not play on my Kindle fire  hd. When app is opened it sits on the pandora home screen and will not go to the stations page. Hope they fix this issue so I can listen to pandora on my Kindle."
42490,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"Love me some Pandora   Love this. Easy to use, great variety, AWESOME tunes. Good job : ) I enjoy it very much. Wish I had better speakers though ...."
42492,"Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora is a great way to appreciate radio.   Pandora is a really cost effective way to listen to the music that fits your tastes. It's a very effective tool to broaden your music horizons as well because the very intuitive music-selection system leads you into other songs and artists that you may not have known or appreciated otherwise. It's a very good way to reflect your musical preferences without becoming too tunnel-visioned in your musical tastes."
42495,"Pandora",2013-11-17,1,"Slow   Before the most recent updates I loved Pandora. Now Pandora is super slow and takes at least 5 minutes to load. Compared to Iheart Radio which takes about 10 seconds. Until the next update I will be using Iheart Radio."

42522,"Pandora",2017-06-06,4,"Pandora rocks and rolls   The selection of music is very wide. I enjoy the thumbprint station as well."
42524,"Pandora",2013-10-17,1,"Doesn't work on kindle fire.   I downloaded the app for kindle fire hd and when I opened it it just stays on the opening screen. I would give it a higher rating, but until this bug is worked out I have to use another music player."
42529,"Pandora",2017-02-26,1,"👎   Ever heard of Spotify?😏"
42537,"Pandora",2016-08-27,3,"Overall ok.   I was disappointed that when I asked for a single artist I still got a mix.  Over all it is great....very few commercials."
42541,"Pandora",2013-06-10,3,"starting to suck   I just got back on Pandora today and I tried to change the song and it wouldn't let me.and before you could change it 6 times.that sucks"

42586,"Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"THE AD'S   I love the pandora app. It runs fast and smoothly on my kindle fire HD. But every few seconds there's a ad pop up and you have to pay a certain amount of money each month so that you can have it ad free which i think is a  rip off"
42587,"Pandora",2016-01-11,5,"Love it   App works great on my Fire tablet :) I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews!"

42597,"Pandora",2012-12-19,3,"Sounds good   Like the sound quality..Too bad you can't download the songs or repeat the songs you like, but it puts together some amazing playlists. 5 stars for the price and sound quality, but minus 2 stars for the reasons mention."

42648,"Pandora",2015-10-21,3,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service   I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
42650,"Pandora",2013-01-09,1,"Pandora   Won't down load, haven't listened to it yet. I'm going back to Best Buy today to have them fix it, I have it on my I phone, and it works perfect!! I listen to Adele all the time!!"

42671,"Pandora",2013-01-23,4,"It's Padora   I love to listen to free music. I so like the concept of pandora. I don't mind a few ads to get to the music free. It is great to make up my own radio music choice stations. The selections that pop up are pretty right on. I would try it for free and then if you don't like it one can delete it or if you one to go a step up without the ads then pay for it."

42680,"Pandora",2013-12-19,1,"Locked up my device.  Didn't work at all.   Locked up my device immediately.  I removed and reloaded it and had the same result.  I have now removed it totally. Couldn't find a way to rate it LESS than 1 star."
42682,"Pandora",2013-11-27,5,"Love Pandora!   Love the selection they choose to play based on the channels I create. Not too many advertisiments like other apps. And also like that they don't censor the lyrics."
42683,"Pandora",2017-06-09,3,"The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good   I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free.  However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music (which was the reason I bought the item).  There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists.  When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song.  The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good.  I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."
42686,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Difficult   At times it is difficult so get to the music and operate the system.  In all fairness, I am a new subscriber and am just trying to learn the system of operation."
42687,"Pandora",2014-04-05,1,"piece of junk   I like the idea of free music, but i would type in a song name and it would bring up a whole different song. It also is VERY VERY slow. Pandora can kiss my butt."
42692,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Love it...   Love Pandora radio. we use it at work and when hanging out. so easy to set up to listen to your favorite music or discover new music also. its a must have"

42698,"Pandora",2012-04-06,1,"Add, ads, ads...   Jango is the same but without all the ads. Deleted Pandora.  Too many ads. Too many ads, ads, ads. Yuk."
42703,"Pandora",2014-05-11,1,"terrible   It never work or came on my phone something with pass word probably and email probably fought for 3 days trying to get it to work or come on forget it"
42705,"Pandora",2013-01-06,4,"Love it minus all the pop-ups and ads   Love it minus all the pop-ups and ads. Might be worth the extra money to get rid of them but I have not yet. Music variety is great."

42739,"Pandora",2013-09-29,1,"complete waste of time   cumbersome stupid and slownot worth the effortcrap crap crap9 more words required and they would all be negative"
42740,"Pandora",2013-12-02,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE!   This app is HORRIBLE! It may be free but it is simply a waste of time to download. Three out of four times that I open the app it gets stuck on the main screen and I have to restart my device in hopes to make the app work. Also, many of times the app lags and/or stops working completely. Not to mention the TERRIBLE music selection. I hate this app and it is a waste of your and my time.You would be better of paying Spotify's monthly fee."

Bring it down to 5% commercials and maybe I'll come back... and no- I won't pay for music to not own it.  I buy and download lots of music legally so the commercials are even more annoying.

42915,"Pandora",2013-01-21,5,"My music   I'm hooked on Pandora. I can listen to spefically the music I like anywhere with just my cellphone. Having a Pandora account lets you select precisely what you want to listen to based on your favorite artists. I'm very happy using Pandora."
42916,"Pandora",2013-05-22,1,"Too ad heavy   Pandora is too add heavy for me.  The ad format is obnoxious with large pop ups in the middle of the screen which are not easily closed.  The in app purchase to get rid of most of the ads is problematic.  This spoiled an otherwise good app."
42924,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"Just great music your style and choice   This is a perfect product for me because I have a Genre that has a handful of artists I know of,  but the intelligence will seek others that I've never heard of.

42941,"Pandora",2016-08-09,1,"No.   This app is very confusing. I cant make playlists of one song, instead i have to listen to WHOLE ALBUMS. Another problem is when im listening to my favorite band, it switches to a different band for me that i probably dont want to listen to. And on top of that is the CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENTS. I know that advertising is in all apps but i DONT WANT AN ADD AFTER EVERY SINGLE SONG. Overall, one star pandora, im switching to spotify."
42947,"Pandora",2017-03-08,3,"So-so   Pandora keeps getting confused about the DIFFERENT stations I create.  I like various types of music.  Pandora often mixes them up.  Other than that, it's pretty good."

I literally waited about half an hour for it to open. Nothing happens. Just saying I got it for the Kindle Fire HD.Don't download it. It's not worth it. (unless you like looking at blue screens, of course)  -.-"

42999,"Pandora",2017-04-26,2,"It use to be music, now it is ads   Use to be great. I could hear two or three songs before getting an ad. That is totally fair for free music. Sometimes, you could watch a short video and get a free hour, which was awesome.Now it is crap. It will play one song, maybe two,  then three to four ads. In a 30 minute time frame I'm hearing more ads then music.It has a ""Why ads"" option, which just tells you to upgrade. Nope, not upgrading, I'm just going to find another option."

43015,"Pandora",2012-11-16,1,"This app is worthless   I installed Pandora twice in my phone and it didn't work correctly either time.  It only plays about 30 seconds of the songs and skips to the next one. Who wants to listen to music like that?  I love Pandora on my pc but hate it on my phone.  I use IHR on my phone now."
43016,"Pandora",2012-12-27,1,"Pandora   Pandora did not work when I tried using it. I got it cause I love music but it didn't work for me."

Those pirates charged me 99 because apparently I reached my limit of free music for April. Well it's April 4 And I barely even listen to it.

I particularly like how it is divided into ""stations,"" so as your mood shifts, you can switch stations simply, and get a new vibe.  The ads are a little spooky though.  They are all about home, and when I am on the road, that deprives me of the experience of foreign radio culture."

43087,"Pandora",2016-02-12,5,"Favorite music app   With all the music apps that I have downloaded and deleted from my phone, Pandora is the only one I've kept. If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I don't like a song, I simply hit ""thumbs down"". If I like a song, I hit ""thumbs up"" and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I've never heard before. It's nice to shake things up sometimes."

Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq.  Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone doesn't like the music i just type in what they like and there happy.  I did have problems getting a specific song but it really didn't matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version.  Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."

43127,"Pandora",2016-11-19,5,"AMAZING app!   This app is AMAZING but when I tilt my kindle sideways the ads cover the screen too much. The last update helped a lot though!"
43129,"Pandora",2016-12-06,4,"Its very very good!   I love it an all but I have FULL INTERNET CONNECTION AND IT SAYS, ""Sorry waiting for connection"" Dang it!"
43139,"Pandora",2017-06-21,5,"Five Stars   Enjoy the musiv"
43142,"Pandora",2016-06-30,5,"PANDORA   What can I say this app rocks. No pun intended. Pandora has the capability to understand your music choices and with that they get your music preferences down and provide music that you will enjoy."
43143,"Pandora",2016-10-19,5,"I love the fact that you get to create different staions ...   I love the fact that you get to create different staions and you choose what you want to listen to according to your mood i think."
43149,"Pandora",2014-05-31,5,"The Music You Like When You Want It   Pandora lets You choose who you listen to and what you listen to. It also allows you to eliminate the Songs, Artist, or Genre that you don't like.. Plus, You can create many different Stations for your listening pleasure by simply typing an Artist name or the Genre. Soon after ""Pandora"" will start to recognize your personal taste in music and play similar Artist, Songs,or Styles of music for you, but ultimately YOU decide what stays and what goes by clicking ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", or if your not in the mood for a particular song, you'll always have the option to just ""Skip it"". I Love ""Pandora""! and You will too. I hope this review was helpful."
43150,"Pandora",2016-10-31,5,"Five Stars   I like the fact that I can choose my own music and I can also save them"
43151,"Pandora",2012-04-25,5,"Free Music!   If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99.  That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."
43152,"Pandora",2016-02-25,5,"5 stars!!   5 stars! I love this music app!!"
43154,"Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet   After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best.  The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all).  Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.  Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music.  It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements.  Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
43155,"Pandora",2011-11-13,1,"Songs never finish   I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I'm very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
43156,"Pandora",2016-10-15,1,"SCAM !!!!   WHAT A SCAM PANDORA IS !!!! It is literally impossible to cancel my subscription!"
43159,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"love   cause it has everything i want.i would reccomend to everyone.i have tried other ones and they play what i like."
43160,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"GREAT   Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to"
43163,"Pandora",2016-04-20,4,"A Great Place for Music   I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I've chosen. To be honest I've only downloaded the app because I don't want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I've created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I'm listening to is truly top notch.In a nutshell, I really don't do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."
43165,"Pandora",2017-06-07,4,"Music is life   Pandora is great for customizing and variety but the commercials are annoying lol still better than FM radio though!!"
43170,"Pandora",2017-05-31,1,"Crapiest radio app ever.   Its the dumbest radio app ever, when I'm using my aunts internet (its rlly good internet) it says ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""When I'm at a laundry mat, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My house, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My parents house ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""  This app is the crapiest app ever. I don't think you should get this app. IHeartRaido is way better than this. Fix it. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
43177,"Pandora",2016-03-06,4,"Is it worth it   I'll be honest Pandora is good at what it does. But it has gone down in quality with all the adds seeing as how every two or so songs I have to deal with 4 adds each time so yeah it's a good app but do you think it's worth paying or waiting through the adds."
43178,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"One of the best music apps!   We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
43180,"Pandora",2013-06-23,5,"Pandora is my Magic Box   Music is my passion. I love many genres.  However, it was difficult to know how to access new music.  By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world.  I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals.  I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music.  Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift!  I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!"
43182,"Pandora",2017-06-12,4,"I love it!   I've always loved Pandora. So its awesome to me. But sometimes it stops in the middle of nowhere. I'm like "" Really"". But I still love it and you should too."
43183,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"Replacing Radio   I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Roku about 2-3 years ago.  I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death.  With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio.  You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre.  You can chose any group you like.  Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music.  I recommend Pandora to everyone!"
43185,"Pandora",2016-12-03,5,"Pandora😄   I love Pandora you can get so many stations!"
43187,"Pandora",2017-02-05,5,"Listen to the music you want to hear.   I use Echo to access Pandora.  I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists.  When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist.  My only complaint is that the volume control don't control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder."
43190,"Pandora",2017-06-18,5,"The original is still the best.   Great streaming channel with a wide variety of music."
43191,"Pandora",2017-09-07,1,"A decade behind!!!   I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I've been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page."
43195,"Pandora",2012-12-26,5,"Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire   I love love love Pandora & have used it for a few years now!! You can't get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now & not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
43199,"Pandora",2013-01-04,5,"perfect   It's the perfect radio, I highly recommend having this app! Just watch out if u don't have unlimited data and its all good. Great for anyone who loves music."

43204,"Pandora",2012-12-16,4,"I like the app   I like this Pandora app for Kindle.  It plays fine & I have not had any problem with force closing.  The only thing I don't like is the pop-ups during play. It doesn't interfere with the player,  I just don't care for it."
43205,"Pandora",2017-05-16,4,"Four Stars   I really really enjoy"
43206,"Pandora",2017-02-07,3,"Could use improvement   I enjoy Pandora, but it could definitely be better.  I do not like the loud commercials.  They are extremely irritating so I either turn off the sound or turn off Pandora when they come on.  Even more disconcerting is when I am listening to Jose Cura a nd other tenors, I suddenly get hit with Heavy Metal!  Definitely not in my comfort zone."
43207,"Pandora",2017-02-16,5,"Amazing   This app is not like others. It allows you to sing along with the lyrics option. In my opinion that is great."

43210,"Pandora",2017-07-23,4,"Sit and listen   Hard to keep on track of songs you like unless you are right there to give thumbs up or down. With some artists once one "" off "" type song get in your set, a lot of other strays get mixed in. Also, even when you do thumbs down on some songs, they still play, but you will get an error message."
43212,"Pandora",2017-07-22,5,"my music my way   i love this it is so many different ways to listen to my kind of music so many selections of songs i created my own music station i wish there was a way you could use your station as a ringtone every time your phone rings a different song would play that would be amazing"
43213,"Pandora",2017-07-20,5,"Love music!   Love music!!! Love Pandora!!!  The best music selection from oldies to today's greatest hits.  Whatever my mood is Pandora will oblige.My brother is in a nursing home and wanted to listen to some Al Green.  He is very old school, does not know anything about streaming or apps.  As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!""  My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing.  We had a BLAST!!!  Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on.  Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music."
43215,"Pandora",2012-12-22,5,"WORKS GREAT DONT BELIVE ALL THOSE HATERS   This apps works great I can listen to music and play order and chaos online. It only stops because you have bad wifi and the commercial happen like every 7 songs to me ands there only 30 sec. I love it I can listen to all my favorite bands like The Ghost Inside, Parkway Drive, Carpathian, Stick to your Guns, and Killswitch engage. Get it who doesn't like FREE MUSIC"

43230,"Pandora",2014-09-07,4,"Good app for an older streaming service   What happened to Pandora?? I'm just cruising along with life when all of a sudden I realize how times have changed and Spotify seems bigger in the market than Pandora.  I feel like I just got old at the thought of how things have changed.But, this app holds up respectably in terms of ease of use and ability to stream music without lag.  I admit I have become more of a Spotify user myself, but for old times' sake, Pandora is just as great of a music streaming service.  The app performs decently as well."
43239,"Pandora",2017-01-02,3,"Some things ARE never ending.   Although it's free, it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music, but then it shuts off to ask if you're still listening!!! Good music, and sounds like a radio with commercials, but stop asking if we're still listening, someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."

One good thing about Pandora is that the adds aren't as bad they don't show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer"

I like several types of good music and have created one or more stations for each of them (depending upon what I am in the mood for).  I have used each of the stations often enough to indicate many ""thumbs up"" recordings that I enjoy on that station.

43276,"Pandora",2013-12-16,5,"Pandora.... plays the best variety of songs that I like to listen to out there   Love this app. Works great on a Droid X.  We have paid the monthly fee so we don't get commercials… That’s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time.  It has lots of features.  Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to.  Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much.  Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool.  Allows you to create as many stations as you like.  If you don't like a song in your genre then ""thumb it down"" and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time."

43284,"Pandora",2017-10-20,3,"Used to be a great product.   Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore (yet it doesn't need it to run?!)."

43288,"Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes   I've been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it's satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I'm on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."

43308,"Pandora",2015-10-12,5,"best music app out there, get Pandora one!   I have left several reviews for this most bad. These were while I was using the free version.  Ads cause it to buffer forever. Music was choppy. Timeouts happened often. After upgrading to Pandora one it's like a whole different app! Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues don't usually stop the music. It's so much faster now it's amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that's not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!"
43319,"Pandora",2014-02-23,5,"Love it...it's a must-have. Kindle Fire HD (original)   Easy to use, and a TON of musical genres are available. If you have the Fire HD with Dolby speakers (as I do), it offers a great listening experience. It's just like a radio station (commercials), but with music you select yourself. It's especially great if you happen to live in a rural farming town that only gets bad country music stations and Jesus radio. Yep, I'm stuck in the sticks and Pandora has probably saved my sanity. Well, whatever little I have left anyway. hahahaha"
43320,"Pandora",2014-03-25,2,"it's no longer Plucky-Little-Pandora   I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn.NO MORE.Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate.This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed.I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad.But I could have live with this change. I did  find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music..............[...]Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and look at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody.""People's music, movie or book choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are....Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million..............Just what, in fact is Pandora's business?It just creeps me out that my music is being used to profile me.I've uninstalled the app."

Select any music, set up multiple channels for your own person desires, set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike.  Its one of the easiest things we've ever had and so much nicer than radio.  No commercials, non-stop music, and just what you want to hear. You can't get better than that!  I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio, every day of the week."

I've made classical and Latin and alternative and celtic stations, just to name a few, and with a few ""like"" and ""dislike"" clicks on various pieces of music, my stations play a wonderful blend of all the things I like best.  I love the way one can add variety to any given station by suggesting different artists, composers or compositions.  Pandora has taken the hours and hours of work out of making the perfect personal blends of music for any occasion.  Highly recommend."

You will spend a lot of ""data"" using Pandora if you are away from home/wireless. Always good to buy songs from Amazon and download to your phone as I do. Find those songs on Pandora/Wifi  while free, and you can buy them very cheap on Amazon... here. A new song a month;.50 cents? something to look forward too. Save your songs on your phone; Then put on the head phones at home or at the doctors office or walking, and read the Bible or the LA Times or new books like author ""Chris Perez, ""To Selena with Love"" !

43413,"Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"The longer you have it the better it gets   I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."

43425,"Pandora",2014-08-22,4,"What a Find!   I am a ""senior citizen"" and new to the idea of sampling music online. My tastes range from Portuguese fado and neo tango music to Brian Eno & Harry Partch. In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.I'm not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me. Three cheers for this new-fangled technology, which is also intuitive and easy to use!"
43426,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"Great app loved it but theres  just one thing.....read on   I love this app. There is only one thing that is really  makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I didn't download.

43449,"Pandora",2015-03-18,2,"Quality has gone downhill   Ive had Pandora One for over a year, and it was great. I enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan that you were still limited with how many songs you could skip but I can deal.For the past three months Ive had ongoing issues with one of my stations that should be playing Today's Hits... normally it plays the newest hits that you find on the current radio and new music. Lately its been playing weird folk music. I've sent numerous emails and have gotten responses ranging from ""we're sorry"" to ""its working as expected"", well its not working as expected. I shouldn't have to thumbs down the same songs more than once on the same station... twice in a row, I shouldn't have to thumbs down it more than once ever on the same station. they seem to hope Ill just give up.My thought is if I'm paying 5 a month for something I expect you to make an effort to fix the issue. Its only one station with the issue, and I cant even delete the station and set it up again... it simply opens the old one back up.Come on Pandora, you can do better. Your service has gone downhill."

The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax.

43537,"Pandora",2012-06-22,5,"Gotta Luv It!! Pandora: A Critical Review   This is by far one of the best mobile app's out there.I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist.  Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay.  Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else.  I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.Pandora radio for mobile.  5 stars."

43543,"Pandora",2014-11-21,3,"Requested Personal Information   I did not download Pandora onto my Kindle when I was asked to give personal information. My nephew explained to me that Pandora wanted that information so they could have commercials that are interesting to a person with my profile. Since I am not a big fan of commercials and I can listen to Amazon Prime Music commercial free, why would I download it."
43546,"Pandora",2013-09-12,5,"I didnt use it because of the quality when your not subscribed, works amazing though   I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
43549,"Pandora",2014-11-13,5,"Pandora is justmy kind of listening.   Pandora is perfect listening tuned to what I like in music. There is music for every genre that I can customize for whatever mood I'm into for the moment.  It's nice to be able to listen to music when you're away from home. You can bring a little comfort into a motel and relax and listen to music you like and it's always good.Pandora is a great station."
43552,"Pandora",2017-09-08,5,"Indispensable semi-passive music listening tool!   Pandora is a great concept, and nicely executed. I learned how to use it and am now addicted! I really like the idea of encountering random tracks that fit into a self-created 'station' idea that I didn't choose directly. I'm still learning how to use its management capabilities, but I've come to use it quite a lot, as over the air radio in non-urban areas (heck, even in urban areas!) leaves a lot to be desired these days. Try it, learn it, you'll love it!"
43560,"Pandora",2013-05-27,5,"I seriously love this   When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me, which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I'm branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I'd never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and didn't know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there's nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. :)"
43562,"Pandora",2012-04-11,5,"Absolutely Fabulous!   Absolutely Fabulous!  I enjoy the quality of the music and my favorite artist from new age t trance and dance music."

43572,"Pandora",2014-07-12,4,"Almost 5 stars - but my station gets invaded frequently with offensive music   I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually (but not always) get music I enjoy.That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the @#$*&^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
43580,"Pandora",2015-05-11,5,"radio   Great  for all your  listening  needs  very limited  commercials. .any type of music  you  can think  of."
43584,"Pandora",2012-12-06,3,"Used to be very good!   Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible.  I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone.  I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio.  I have to say I am not jealous anymore.  This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed:  1.  Slacker  2.  Iheart Radio  3.  Pandora  Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."
43585,"Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"I love, love   I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
43587,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"music, music, music   I love Pandora. It plays in the background while I do other things on my laptop or my Kindle.

I needed a little pick me up the other day. I love listening to Chris Tomlin and some of the other Christian Artist's. What a blessing! I can carry the music with me from room to room, outside or in the car. That's why I've rated the app 5 stars."

I have several favorite stations and switch them to match my mood.  One thing I really like is I can set a timer to turn it off whenever I want to use it to serenade me before I go to sleep.  I can also wake to music if I so choose.  I also use it on my computer but not as often as I do on my phone."

I have it on my Android Phone and I can't like, dislike, skip songs, or do anything without the app eventually freaking out and playing up to 4 songs at once before it finally lets me quit the app and relaunch it.

I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."
43680,"Pandora",2015-10-03,4,"Great for Discovery   Overall, Pandora has a seemingly infinite array of music available for playing and I love to discover new music and artists that I might like. I really find the fine-tuning feature helpful because it allows you to obtain a more specific music taste. Thanks to Pandora, I now regularly listen to Melanie Martinez, Marina and The Diamonds, Lana del Rey, and many other amazing artists I'd never think I'd discover. It's a great app for those who wish to expand their personal music library."

I do not have a smart phone or IPad, so have to really learn how to navigate this device, and it's not as easy as some would have you believe!"

I really enjoy listening to a specific channel based on an artist and the other music that is mixed with it are very similar. Overall, it is a great app and I would certainly recommend it to my family and friends. The one thing I do not like is how it goes idle after a period of time. I suppose that is a way of ""saving battery power"" or something like that, so it's not too big of a problem."

43719,"Pandora",2013-09-17,5,"Awesome Music!   I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!"
43720,"Pandora",2017-03-29,1,"Service Please   Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"
43722,"Pandora",2012-11-10,5,"Love it!   There is nothing more enjoyable than being able to type in the name of an artist or music genre, thensit back and listen. If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down""icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simplyclick and select a new one."
43723,"Pandora",2014-05-25,5,"Best way to find new music   Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense."
43726,"Pandora",2017-05-09,5,"Love it!   I've always loved Pandora! Love how they can figure out our tastes and especially now that we can skip back to the previous song! :)"

I also like the wide variety of music available."

Not able to listen to Pandora on  such receivers so I now found Slacker Radio and use it via the iPod connection.  Music selection with minimal 30-second commercials is free and finding better music selection/rotation than my paid Pandora music subscription. I have become a Slacker and goodbye to Pandora!"

43769,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"Love Pandora!!!!   Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears.  Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
43770,"Pandora",2014-04-16,5,"Absolutely Amazing!   If you love music this is YOUR app! First, the app is free and so is the music! If your into singers like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato it gives it you! Or if you like rock bands like Metallica or Nirvana they have it too! All you have to do is search the band/singer name and it will come up. And also if it's your favorite song, you can like it and it will play at times. I love this app and so will you!"
43779,"Pandora",2015-04-29,5,"Good App   So far I have never had it ask with on the Kindle app if ""I am still listening"" so that it a huge advantage to listening to Pandora on the computer. If anyone else has had a different experience I am curious to know about it--so let me know."

43784,"Pandora",2014-04-01,5,"Superi-ear!   It's free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it's free.  Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can't do that on the radio and it's still free.  I love Pandora.  The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."

Also, it keeps ""suggesting"" that I up grade, which means a monthly fee.  This maybe how they get you to upgrade, starting and stopping.  I am going to look into other media."

43825,"Pandora",2014-06-29,4,"A must for music lovers   I love it when I can't sleep or want to hear new things.  I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone.  It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music.  I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection."
43826,"Pandora",2016-09-29,5,"Five Stars   My favorite go-to music streaming app for probably going on a decade now, and still getting better and better."
43828,"Pandora",2013-08-17,4,"Pandora   I love Pandora! It is free ( at least for now tho' I heard a rumor that they were going to start charging, at which time I'll cancel) and you are able to bookmark songs and groups, build a list of ""stations"" to listen to, and change and alter items according to your listening habits. My taste runs pretty eclectic from an Eddie Cochran station to Mumphord and Sons. So give a trial run and I think you'll become a Pandora fan."
43830,"Pandora",2014-01-07,5,"Music for Your Taste and Mood --- on the cheap   I love Pandora and listened through the occasional commercials for free for years. Recently, I finally discovered how totally cheap a subscription is (just a couple of bucks a month!) and signed up as a paying customer. No more ads --- wish I'd not been so cheap and done it years ago.Only down side: my girlfriend likes the availability of lyrics and has to sing along..."
43831,"Pandora",2015-11-06,5,"Free-Music-Streaming   Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist. Also has a great ability to suggest songs that you wouldn't normally listen to, but are a similar type of music as the playlist you're listening to."
43833,"Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"I don't know how I lived without it   Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!"

43862,"Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"Pandora is the best   Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear. They will even find similar songs to match to your interest. I started with Johnny Cash, and before I knew it through their recommendations I had many songs by many artists that they play randomly for me. I love it. And, they are adding more regularly. You can't beat this service and best of all it's free."

43868,"Pandora",2014-03-10,5,"love it   I love the way it suggests other artists you might like and have found several that I hadn't really listened to before and really liked their music. And best of all it's free, you just have to listen to a few commercials but there aren't that many. For some reason when I listen at work it ""times me out"" but when I'm listening at home I don't get that."

After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.lag time in between songs is usually pretty good (not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection) but overall not bad considering that I'm driving through numerous cell towers as I'm usually listening to Pandora.  lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.Nice album art when its playing (too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads) and very easy to use command buttons."

44034,"Pandora",2014-12-26,1,"Too time consuming.   In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be ""tuned in."" To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate."

44037,"Pandora",2014-04-13,5,"Love Pandora   I have been using Pandora for many years. I have created many of my own stations and added a lot of preset type stations from them. If you don't like what is on one station you will almost certainly find something on another. I use the free version but if you do listen a lot like my daughter, you might like the yearly or monthly subscription."
44041,"Pandora",2015-07-30,4,"intrusive display ads that got annoying but its song library is massive   Large, intrusive display ads that got annoying but its song library is massive, and its programming works wonderfully. Extremely easy to use, but it's also very good at getting to know your musical taste. The ads are why I only gave 4 stars."
44042,"Pandora",2017-09-02,2,"Disappointing   Disappointed with Pandora's sound quality though the app works OK."
44044,"Pandora",2014-04-05,3,"Its Ok   I liked the idea that I could listen to my music virtually commercial free...the ones I did hear weren't yelling at me like the radio stations do.  The only drawback that I found was that after a few songs, it stopped playing.  When I tried to reload it, it wouldn't so I went back to my saved music I have on my micro SD card."
44048,"Pandora",2016-07-02,1,"WHAT?   Pandora would not accept me as a customer!"
44052,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"How can you not love this?   How can you not  love Pandora? It is so easy to use and it seems to play what you want to hear when you need to hear it. I have pandora on my computer, iPhone, TV and at work. Sometimes I want to hear a mix of my saved stations and other times, I just want to hear one. Pandora makes all this easy! Now, there are ads and I need to click on ""Still Listening"" every so often, but its free and I am ok with that."
44053,"Pandora",2014-12-31,2,"Check coverage (if outside the US) before bothering to download it.   I used to love Pandora, until they decided to leave Mexico out of their service area. Now we get Spotify and Google Play and Grooveshark which, while not as good, at least they work over here.Which brings me to my main question: Why are you offering this app to me if I can't use it?"
44055,"Pandora",2013-05-23,5,"Though I do, There is no point of buying music with Pandora, SoundCloud, etc.   I'm a DJ/VJ.Subscriber to White-Label, Virtual DJ Premium, ASCAP, and was a subscriber to 3 other labels.The industry should and is going down in CD sales with Pandora, Slacker, MusicTube, etc. and alternativesto.net but it's the era of making money in other ways like product placement and adds.There is really no point to buying what we use to buy with advertisements on Pandora, etc. and Office Starter for example. And the industry is going that way, BTW.Pandora is worth it. $36 for 1 year. Free if you want to take more advertisements.XM I can get 6 months for $25.Everything is going open source. And the advertisements are getting heavy.For all relating to Open Source/ie free/ the best website to figure this out is alternativesto.net"

Once it's downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you've created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone.  Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step.  Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there.  Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web.  But they're short compared to commercial radio.  And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all.  The music will be higher quality (192K bits per second) and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device."

44127,"Pandora",2014-12-29,4,"I love my Pandora   I have been using Pandora for free for 3 years and I love it.

It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.Problems you'll find if you use the free version of Pandora:-The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open.-You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station (where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.)*EDIT*-It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music.  You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment.^ This is now possible.  They have fixed it and made the application even better.My qualms with the application, but it is good nonetheless."

44262,"Pandora",2013-12-30,1,"FREE: HALF TRUE   I loved  the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not  frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount  of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I  was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life  now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their  free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned  that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start  up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being  deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was  free  and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a  solution that would allow someone  who  had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would  even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so  quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year  I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information.  It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."
44266,"Pandora",2014-03-25,4,"Made a Scarlatti channel, a Vladimire Ashkenazy channel, Rubenstein, Horowitz   Lovely - all my favorite old school concert pianists, some lovely vintage recordings turn up as a nice surprise, and of course, Scarlatti wrote enough pieces to keep anyone happy for a very long time.  Interrupted by loud commercials now and then, but it is free, so cannot complain, and if I wanted, I could purchase it and avoid the ads."

The special should be that we can have a station that is called my bookmarks and the station should be about where you can listen to your bookmarks in any order and you listen to just your bookmarks.I hope this sounds interesting to you so I hope that maybw you can try it out if you dont lile it you dont have to keep it THANKS,a listener...."

Enough about that. I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection.I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists.I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't.My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song."

Then all of a sudden I couldn't access.  It just seems like it is constantly in scan mode during the daytime hours.  It returns a message that my station will be back in a minute.  At night I can access.  But that doesn't help me at work during the day.  If I could access it more regularly, I would give it 5 stars cause I love the concept."

It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission.  I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."

44399,"Pandora",2013-06-07,5,"Joe reviews another one   This is the best music app as far as radio is considered. There are very little adds and you can listen to anything you like. Lets say you like Queen, The Beatles, or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear, Boston, Adam and the ants, Electric Light Orchestra, and more great 70-80's bands."
44403,"Pandora",2015-08-28,1,"worst.   a zero if i could write it.  They don't seem to take into account what i like and don't like. Also, there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version.  the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement.  Stay away and go to Songza or another site."

44432,"Pandora",2014-01-06,4,"Pandora helps expand my musical awareness and access   One of the things I love most about Pandora is how one artist leads to another, introducing me to music and musicians.  The fact that I can access it anywhere has helped me make it through road trips in the car and spinning at the gym. I only wish their play list for some of my favorite artists was longer/deeper. That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome."

44442,"Pandora",2017-08-20,5,"Pandora is a great get   I listen to Pandora practically everyday. I really like their feature allowing me to create stations around various genres and bands, so if a song pops into my head (and I know the band/singer doing it) I can create a station using that name and Pandora will play more of their stuff along with similar music from other artists. Great to have it playing in the background in my office while I'm working. Two thumbs and two big toes up."

44459,"Pandora",2015-07-25,5,"I love Pandora!   I love Pandora!! It allows me the chance to pick the music style I want to listen to and make a channel that plays similar music. I find new artists that I had never heard of before everyday. If I don't like a song they are playing all I have to do is give it a thumbs down and it disappears from the playlist. I have channels I pick to clean house by, dance to, and just hang out to. Love Pandora!"
44465,"Pandora",2014-03-17,4,"I enjoy Pandora   I like Pandora Radio, even if it has commercials. I'm able to have several stations. some times it keeps playing music i don't love, but don't hate, but it irritates me after 3/4 song. Now, the advertising has gotten overwhelming the only thing is that Pandora radio is  mostly music and half of the advertising is not heard. I do enjoy the new sleep timer, very convenient."
44466,"Pandora",2015-11-10,5,"Nice choice of music and channels   Nice choice of music and channels.  However, while using my mobile device I'm asked every few hours if I'm still listening.

Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream.Now, they want $4.99 a month, a HUGE 166% PRICE INCREASE, with no annual payment option.  Thanks, but no thanks.Given Pandora's limited song repertoire and excessive ads and commercials, it's just not worth it.it's time to move on.  There are better options out there."

What's not to like?! Thank you, Pandora!"
44502,"Pandora",2014-01-18,5,"Pandora   I chose 5 stars because Pandora provides free music. They have any artists you'd like to listen to and when you create a station you're able to add another artist to play on that same station. You can also like or dislike any song which helps Pandora know what you like. However, if you don't like commercials, then you need to purchase Pandora which I believe is very cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music."
44503,"Pandora",2015-11-05,4,"Great Progfram   My only problem is the lack of a timer.  I would like to set it to fun for, say. 1/2 hour and then turn off.  Then I could go to sleep to music.  I really like the huge selection of artists I can hear.  I also like hearing it on my blackberry while moving around."
44510,"Pandora",2015-10-30,4,"If Only....   I would give it 5 stars but I dont like that you can only skip so many songs per channel and I thought that when you bookmark a song it goes to a folder that you can play at any time. It doesnt though. Other than that, I like it so far. I have only had it for a week."

44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about those ads, (about those ads) no music   So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone.  I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow.  But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for.  But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad.  I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well.  Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track.  I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing.  In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."

44550,"Pandora",2012-07-22,5,"Love It!   Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course, so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all.  You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations.  And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I've had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion.  I also play it on my home computer.  Its free and I love it."

It is great being able to play just the kind of music I like and the commercials are very few.  The app also plays longer than the Pandora does on my computer.  There I have to keep going and indicate I am still listening.  I like that I don't have to rush over and hit the Yes, I am still listening."

The kids even have a kid friendly channel.  We did go commercial free on ours. Just personal choice there."

44568,"Pandora",2013-08-12,5,"Pandora is great.  c:   I absolutely love this radio. It plays tons of similar tracks that are exactly what i want to listen to. I would recommend it for some one who is more open minded about music, not as specific because it doesnt always play the song that you are wanting to hear, however it might play a song that you dont know that could be better. Its great for some one who is wanting to widen their musical horizons."

But in the last 2 days when I try to log on it just says &#34;we are experiencing technical difficulties.&#34; I know I entered my email and password right because I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and when you type in a letter it shows up until you type in the next letter. And I entered it at least 15 times. Same with the e-mail minus the hide the letter part."
44583,"Pandora",2012-08-30,5,"I love it   I love pandora app because it has every kind of usic on it and if your in the mood for lets say, country, they have all kinds of country songs, even on the radio. If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and author(s)put you can't pick the song. Pandora doesn't have station either, which I'm thankful for."

I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there (Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly) as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire.

44601,"Pandora",2013-09-29,4,"Awesome, but ...........   I liked this app a lot. It is great for listening to music on a mobile device and it stays signed in to your account. My only problem with it is that it picks songs for you based on the station you create on it. You can't actually pick the song itself, so there are some songs you don't like on it. Pandora learns what you like and don't like by you giving the song a thumbs up or down. Overall, it's a great app. I would have given it 5 stars if you could pick the song!"
44604,"Pandora",2012-08-04,5,"Amazing free music app   I don't know what to say that probably hasn't alreadt been said in praise of PANDORA on mommy KindleFire. Name an artist and voila, you have a ""station "" that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot (and I do) you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a ""greatest hits "" album and often that is exactly where they come from.But hey, if you get bored with the repeats,  quickly create a new station.This app can't. Be beat for a source of tunes for your KindleFire or other aneroid device."

It will stop mid song and move on another, or it will just stop playing and you have exit and start again. I could tolerate it if these instances were few and far between, but they're not, and once they start happening they keep happening.That's not to say you shouldn't use it, because let's face it for free music listening it's pretty much your only option, but know that you are at some point going to be yelling at your phone over it."

Interface is pretty good.  If you add enough variety the stations do an decent job of fitting your tastes.  Eats up data if you are not on a wifi network, but that is to be expected."

Of course Pandora is great, but after one song plays, I have to unlock my phone and wait for the next song to load, or rather, a commercial and then the next song. Kind of inconvenient.

The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service.  Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker.  Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."

Here are a few highlights you can expect with your Pandora player:1. very few songs played over and over and over and over again2. only run the player on one device at a time3. extremely expensive for what you get - spend the $36 a year on 36 single downloads and you'll have more variety and better quality.DON'T USE PANDORA!"
44708,"Pandora",2015-10-25,2,"I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music   I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music.  Recently, however, it appears that the listener is being pushed away from free listening toward the premium pay listening.I receive about 80% of a song before Pandora switches to another song.  Very annoying.I am switching to another alternative."

I can have every genre of music that I enjoy and it is very relaxing and helps me stay focused.When I can get away with it, I choose Pandora over television so when I am alone in the house, you will find Pandora playing at my home as well.  It is my station of choice."
44713,"Pandora",2013-10-14,5,"Music to go.   Pandora creates ""stations"" of music similar to any artist you submit.  ""Peter Gabriel"" for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting.  This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet.  It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials."
44714,"Pandora",2015-02-12,3,"ok app if you have the time   I don't use it any more but it is free music"
44715,"Pandora",2014-06-06,3,"I am not to pleased.   When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."

44720,"Pandora",2014-06-29,5,"5 Thumbs Up!!   I love music and Pandora provides me with music that I like. It also exposes me to music that I've never heard before which turns me on to musicians and bands that I wouldn't ordinary hear that I end up liking. It provides an avenue that I can somewhat steer towards the music that appeals to me. I listen to Pandora on a daily basis and have for a few years now. 5 thumbs up for Pandora! Thanks!"
44727,"Pandora",2015-09-13,5,"Easy to Use and Works Great   Downloaded and installed quickly and easily on my Kindle Fire. Already use Pandora on my PC and smart Blue Ray players, so I already have an account and personalized stations set up. Pandora is a real pleasure to listen to. With a decent pair of headphones on the Kindle Fire, the sound is excellent."
44728,"Pandora",2014-01-14,5,"I love this app   WOW!I'm impressed!It took me a couple of tries to find my genre because I guess I like a lot of themBut once I typed in ""pop rock"" the first song to pop up was my favorite song inThe whole wide world. The second was I song I loved but couldn't figure out theName.The only thing I have to criticize is that there are a lot of pop up ads but you canFix that by upgrading but it costs money.GO PANDORA!"

I'll put it on the nearest sound system quite frequently, and the most recent download, the one for my Samsung Galaxy IV lets me plug into the radio on my truck and play quite good audio on the go.  So far, this has not made a big dent in my monthly allotment of gigabytes of download over Verizon, in part because most of the time I use it on devices attached to my home network either via Ethernet or wirelessly that are served by high speed cable based internet service."

44799,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Works Well   I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"

44805,"Pandora",2014-05-20,3,"make the switch!   Switch to Spotify! You can download fave songs to listen while on the road/etc. without burning up data!! Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive, ex. gives suggestions for different stations, singers, etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"

I have reinstalled the program four times in one day.  It works fine on my ipad, but not on my Kindle fire.  Is it me or a problem with the app and the Kindle?"
44810,"Pandora",2016-05-22,3,"Good. But not on the new Kindle Fire.   Couldn't get it to work on my new Kindle Fire. I really like Pandora and the amount of music you can listen to, but I'd be better off using my computer or phone t use it."

44819,"Pandora",2014-01-09,5,"A music lovers dream app   This app is designed for the true music lover.  Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up.

44830,"Pandora",2014-05-19,4,"perfect except....   I love Pandora and how you can create your own stations and a million different kinds. The only thing I wish you could also select would be soundtracks. There are so many soundtracks I'd love to listen too, even if there were similar soundtracks thrown in. A little trickier than a genre or artist but not impossible.No complaints otherwise."

44856,"Pandora",2012-10-13,5,"Wonderful!   I always have and always will love the services Pandora provides. I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)! And the way Pandora is set up for my Kindle Fire HD is far superior to the application on my iTouch. This version hardly ever freezes and does not deliver choppy music. I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily."

44880,"Pandora",2014-06-20,5,"The pinnacle of relaxation.   This app provided me with a source of peace. I just set a time limit and zone out on the sofa. I love switching in between my selected genres without having to worry about being stuck with an unpleasant song. I can either skip it or dislike it. It is also great for when I'm doing other stuff. I just turn it on and put it off to the side whilst I work. I thoroughly enjoy this app."

44892,"Pandora",2015-04-22,4,"Great app   I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music.

44899,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"awesome just pure awesome   I love this app! After you've made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle (which I love) and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"

You can collect albums and songs from your favorites and they even have stations that are created through your favorite song or artist. I have Pandora on Roku  and enjoy it through my television, computer and Kindle. I love the music.  Music choices seem endless and if you want commercial free and ad free music, the subscription price is amazingly low."
44912,"Pandora",2014-06-07,5,"I really like Pandora!   I enjoy the unending possibilities of music. I can listen on my own time with my 'own' stations which I have created.I travel and love not being dependent on  a sound system anywhere. It is an answer to television and I feel great for not just wasting time on 'dippy movies'. I can fill my mind with great music!"

I don't. get why people give this one star it's awesome cause when I put a band name it gives me the songs thar I want. Plus, when you want to just change it you don't have to get rid of the other radio, you could still keep it. The only thing that ticks me off is that commercials come up every 6 songs , but I'm still giving this app a 5 star rating. Don't ever listen to the people saying that it freezes or anything like that. So, get the app seriously, GET THE APP!!!!!!"
44945,"Pandora",2012-11-30,2,"pandora used to be awesome!!!   I listen to Pandora constantly while on my kindle fire. up until a few weeks ago I would have definitely given this app 5 stars. but lately it gets stuck every few songs almost every time an ad comes up. I have to keep exiting and opening it up again just to hear a few more songs before it gets stuck again. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but that did not do any good. Pandora still seems to be running great on my Pc though. weird. please fix this problem because it is very annoying!"

The product is great. Set stations as you want, delete as you want, skip songs. No problems. I was skeptical about this product but a friend of mine also got it on her tablet and she loved it so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. Love it!!! No problems and if you don't like it you can delete it, it isn't hard. No complaints!! Thanks."
44969,"Pandora",2013-06-04,5,"Its great for Music Lovers   Its a really great app for music. You can listen to different types of music (pop, country, ect.) And if you don't like a song you're listening to: don't worry. You can tap a ""next"" button which takes you to a different song. But beware! There's only 6 times in an hour you can do this. Its free, and you get to listen to a bunch of music. If you want to go free on music, just get the app and you get to listen to free music. Enjoy!"

However, I do have one complaint. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes you get music that shouldn't even be categorized next to a genre. If I type in ""Disturbed,"" I don't want ""Britney Spears."" Period."
45047,"Pandora",2012-05-31,3,"love pandora but app could use improvements   there are no technical issues with this app and I use it all the time on my Fire.  however, I don't like getting audio ads.  I don't get them when I listen his the web do why via an app?  also I am now getting tmobile ads in Spanish.  I don't listen to music in Spanish.  this is really really annoying.  additionally, I cant tweak my channels on the app like I can via the web.  please add this as a feature.  oh, please let me see songs I previously listened to like I can on the web."
45048,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Luv it"
45051,"Pandora",2017-09-12,5,"Great music app   No need to download music when you have Pandora! It has so many choices at a single touch!"
45054,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"Pandoria!!!   I Love This App!I'm Listining To It As I Write This Review:)It Gives You Free Music:)It Does Not Give You What You Want To Listin To Whenyou make a station...It gives you a song that's like it...I kinda like that though, gives you more choices to makewith your amazon card or itunes card.overall.... great app!!!"
45069,"Pandora",2017-10-30,5,"Five Stars   Great variety of music! Also a great price; $4.99/mo. with no commercials - gotta love that!"
45070,"Pandora",2013-10-20,3,"Works but keeps dropping songs at end   Downloaded this for my Android tablet and works fine except keeps dropping the song and moving to the next before the end of the song.  I have deleted and reinstalled but still happens.  Pandora is not my favorite as we have same issues in the car on my Android phone (4g Verizon) and on our TV.  I still prefer iHeart which does not drop but I can't get on my old Tablet."
45072,"Pandora",2014-05-28,5,"cool app   I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"
45083,"Pandora",2012-12-25,3,"It's ok!   I wish Pandora would allow me to pick the specific music I want to hear.  I guess it wasn't designed to do that.  So it's just a three star review from me."
45085,"Pandora",2017-11-01,5,"Awesome   Love it...people often ask me what music station I'm using... great choice"
45087,"Pandora",2016-03-10,3,"Its ok.   Not bad.  Unfortunately the algorithm doesn't differentiate between stations.  Eventually you will hear what you like from your Willie Nelson station on your Nine Inch Nails station."
45092,"Pandora",2015-02-09,3,"Ok...   It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."
45093,"Pandora",2017-04-18,5,"Pandora rocks   It wakes me up and puts me to sleep absolutely love it"
45097,"Pandora",2017-07-31,5,"Five Stars   rarely use the app but it was worth the purchase"

45104,"Pandora",2017-11-11,2,"Don't like new update!   I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!"
45106,"Pandora",2016-04-29,1,"One Star   The latest release is fraught with issues."
45108,"Pandora",2017-06-10,5,"I love it! I was able to get rid of ...   I love it!  I was able to get rid of my EXPENSIVE Sirrius radio!!!"

45117,"Pandora",2013-01-27,5,"Pandora is wonderful because you hear the music you love......................   For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists.  Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song.Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it."
45120,"Pandora",2017-03-17,5,"Love Pandora   Love the variety.  Easy to use"
45121,"Pandora",2016-07-20,5,"latina   I luv it. There r such different music genres to choose from. Literally its great. Im happy because being hispanic, its hard getting mjsic that i like such as reggaeton. I appreciate it, and im sure u will too. Get it. Trust me...u wont regret it"
45122,"Pandora",2016-10-31,5,"Five Stars   it pandora"
45124,"Pandora",2013-04-12,5,"free and unlimited   Pandora radio is awesome! Thank you Pandora for making it possible to listen to free unlimited radio. I was elated to learn that you had dropped the limited minute radio use. Being able to not only create your own radio stations, but to create favorites (thumbs up) or never having to listen to a particular song again (thumbs down) is pure freedom. Your service is very much appreciated! Fun for the entire family...."
45125,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Five Stars   A super App."
45126,"Pandora",2013-09-04,4,"Music to sweat by !   Pandora is great for the gym.  I can listen to all types of music and it makes my workout go by faster and more enjoyable."
45130,"Pandora",2012-05-21,5,"Pandora Rocks!   Because I have never been able to stick with just one type of music to enjoy, Pandora is perfect for me.  The site lets me select all the different types of music/artists together in one place for my listening pleasure without my having to do anything but rate the music as it is played.  I tell Pandora who I like and they find music for my listening pleasure.  Sometimes I use Pandora on my computer (with headphones) and sometimes I just listen over my HTC."
45131,"Pandora",2012-12-21,5,"Love this app on any device   I love this app on any device. It is so nice to listen to all the music you want to and it still has way less ads than listening to a radio."
45134,"Pandora",2015-05-03,3,"Not keeping up with competition   I like Amazon Prime radio better. Amazon allows you to repeat a song, advance to a later part of the song, shows the lyrics (Pandora dropped this feature from mobile), and has free downloads of some songs. Creating playlists also a big plus."
45137,"Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"Great music choice works fine on Kindle Fire Hd   Pandora is great and it seems to learn my musical tastes the more I use it. works fine on Kindle fire hd."
45141,"Pandora",2015-05-15,4,"can't undo dislike?   I like having a simple program for listening to random music. I prefer the Pandora algorithm over other services. But I accidentally disliked a song I actually like. Can't find a way to undo this. Seems like an obvious option to me, but not included."
45147,"Pandora",2011-12-08,2,"Not Available in Panama   I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire.  The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio.  To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.As you can imagine, I'm not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face.  Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.Omar Upegui R.Panama, Republic of PanamaCentral America"
45151,"Pandora",2015-03-22,5,"Eyeintheskky   Love the the vatriety of music.  The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you don't like.  Great way to match music to individual tastes.  Kudos Pandora!"
45154,"Pandora",2013-07-13,5,"Efficient control over what you listen to   What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel.  You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy.  Lots of programs can play one group over and over.  Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."
45158,"Pandora",2013-06-20,5,"My house has been redone by Pandora   Every time I paint a room, I've done it with Pandora blasting.  With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home.  The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends.  We are home."

45173,"Pandora",2014-02-12,5,"Best App Ever.   Pandora is a useful app for listening to various types of music. The Genome project has been succesful in creating an app that generates a radio station specific to your taste.  Unlike other radio apps that play just the populatlr songs i like pandora because it plays all the songs on an album not just the mainstream ones."
45175,"Pandora",2017-06-26,5,"Five Stars   Always good music"
45176,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"song options and lists   I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back toThe songs that you just listened to. Also I don't like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"
45177,"Pandora",2015-07-26,2,"tablet/kindle problems   I love pandora but I've recently been having trouble getting into it on both my tablet and kindle. I end up having to uninstall and reinstalling the app in order for it to work. no problems on my desktop,  tho."

Being on Social Security Disability does not allow for a lot of extras. With Pandora, I can find whatever I want and listen to it for free. Don't mind the commercials, they have to pay for their station of incredible choices somehow!"

After using it for several months, I decided I would leave a review because I base most of my purchases on others' reviews as well.I use Pandora on my PC, and the Pandora app hasn't let me down on my Kindle. It's free, feels like the website, and runs in the background while I read a book or surf the web. I would say this is a must-have app!"

45218,"Pandora",2017-08-01,2,"Needs more work   Everytime I'm using this app and reopen it on my HD8 tablet, it always shows the previous song name rather than the current song name.

If i had paid for it i would feel cheated.The promise of liustening only to music i like is a lie.The stuff they offered when i asked for Mozart was stuff I would never even classify as the same genre. I can't even imagine what genre that stuff was part of. Very disappointed!I've uninstalled it. I might try spotify (?) or some other music app.Very disappointed!If i could i would give it a rating of minus stars ! ! !VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! !"

My fiance' plays it more than I do and he loves it. He's a big music person and likes the same choice I do. Pandora is great, I'd refer anyone to it who is a music lover."

I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora.***5/23/13***I have returned to Pandora! They repaired the app. Sure, there are more commercials but that's ok. Try it, you can't beat the price. Few apps have given me greater enjoyment."
45421,"Pandora",2016-09-22,2,"Love pandora but only have iphone 4 and within the ...   Love pandora but only have iphone 4 and within the past week will no longer play saying I need to update to iOS 8 which isn't an option for me."
45424,"Pandora",2012-05-30,5,"Amazing!!   this is by far the best radio station app ever. love it! you can create multiple stations and listen to the seperately or go on quick mix.And for those of you who are rating this 1 star because of the adds, you do realize they have to pay to run this somehow. if you hate the adds so much, then pay the whole dollar a month to not have adds. this app is fantastic!"
45428,"Pandora",2013-03-12,4,"Nice application   If it weren't for the commercials I would have given 5 stars. I like that there are so many different stations to choose from. And the options to skip a song if you don't want to listen to it is nice. Also the thumbs up and thumbs down option is great. Especially when you don't like a song so it won't choose it at random later."
45431,"Pandora",2016-09-25,3,"Three Stars   Have trouble with volume when playing through car audio system"
45439,"Pandora",2016-03-23,3,"Will Not Download!!   After awhile I deleted it then when I tried to download it again It said Preparing Download for 2 days"
45443,"Pandora",2016-08-10,4,"Four Stars   I love being able to hear my favorite songs and artists when I want to"
45449,"Pandora",2017-06-16,5,"Music   It's a helpful and I love the music and yea so thanks and yayayy"
45451,"Pandora",2017-04-20,5,"Five Stars   All the music I could want!"
45452,"Pandora",2012-06-08,3,"Getting worse somehow   Won't play after being idle for a few minutes, I have to close the app and re-open it to get it started again. Multiple times I've had it randomly skip through all my channels when it's not on quick mix. I hate to complain about ads, but they seem to be getting longer and more often. At least make the ads different sometimes, it's always the same ads over and over."
45457,"Pandora",2012-02-21,4,"stop complaining   people are saying that Pandora is declining, but i haven't experienced any problems that everyone is complaining about. my only issue is the commercials and they only come on like once an hour. the songs never stop randomly and pandoda is still working fine fkr me. if you're having a problem with Pandora, either suck it up and deal with it or use something else like iHeartRadio."
45462,"Pandora",2017-01-13,5,"its great   I like it it is really Good and you need to add more stations please I love Pandora so much."
45463,"Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best Personalized Radio EVER!!   Pandora is awesome! If I'm cleaning up around the house or hosting a slumber party for my little sister, Pandora always has the best stations to choose from. Today's Hits radiois hands-down my favorite.  Its better than 92.5 or 93.3 on the real radio stations. Choose Pandora now if you love music and you think that stopping every 3 minutes to put a new song on youtube is insane!"
45464,"Pandora",2016-06-13,4,"Four Stars   Really enjoy the tunes and there are less commercial interruptions than before."
45467,"Pandora",2015-09-04,5,"Works great on Blackberry 10!   Would rather listen on my nice home system, but the mobile version is a must have; should be one of the first apps one downloads to new phone."
45472,"Pandora",2012-10-28,3,"Needs another upgrade!   on the ipod if you bookmarks a track you can go to another feature on it and listen to all the songs you've bookmarked. on the kindle you bookmarks something and nothing really happens it just says track bookmarked or the songs name bookmarked. please make another update so we can listen to songs we bookmarks. wow I said bookmarks a lot:)"
45476,"Pandora",2012-12-22,4,"Good music.   Nice job of permitting selection/rejection of desired music. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. There!"
45477,"Pandora",2014-05-25,4,"Good music--the way I like it   I like Pandora because you can choose the songs, artists, genre, etc. that you most enjoy. You even have the choice of liking or not a particular arrangement of a favorite song. Very helpful in providing background music while working."
45478,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Great Selection   Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."
45479,"Pandora",2016-07-11,1,"screw pandora   too many ads, and the company is way to political. Screw you pandora."
45480,"Pandora",2016-03-06,3,"But not nearly as good as   Can't pick specific songs ...  Volume is inconsistent... OK ... But not nearly as good as Spotify"
45482,"Pandora",2013-08-17,5,"Love Pandora!   I love music and Pandora makes it really easy to listen to the music I love.  Where else can I get my BB King fix while I exercise at the gym?  Okay, so every once in a while I have to listen to a commercial, so what?  On typical broadcast radio there are many, many more commercials and the music generally is....(can I say this?) crap!Another great feature is that I can listen to Pandora at home on my Roku."
45491,"Pandora",2016-05-03,1,"I really like it when it will play   I really like it when it will play, but it stops after it's been playing for 10 minutes and then it plays for a few seconds and shuts off again."
45497,"Pandora",2012-03-30,4,"Love it :)   I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I don't like a song, just put thumbs down. But it's kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials :)"
45498,"Pandora",2013-06-10,5,"Lexi(:   Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."
45499,"Pandora",2015-11-28,5,"Pandora is amazing!   This app is amazing because you can listen to your favorite music and, you could also hi on a run at the same time."

45512,"Pandora",2013-04-23,5,"Use it almost daily!   I love Pandora and have been listening to it almost daily. I have most of my 100 station allotment already in use!  I love the shuffle feature and the variety of music that gives me.  I have pandora going in my home from morning till dinner time.  I think that the annual membership is a great price."
45519,"Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"Pandora   I can play the artist I like.  Being a 1940s' guy I can get the big band music I enjoy and the vocalist of the 40s' singing music that you can actually understand."
45529,"Pandora",2016-07-29,5,"Love Pandora.   Love pandora and all the stations they have. I had a paid Subscription for awhile but cancelled it. The ads really aren't that annoying."

45543,"Pandora",2012-01-22,5,"Love it paid or free   What can I say about Pandora.  It's always been fair about paid and free subscriptions.  The free version is a great marketing tactic.  It keeps the name brand up and for those that pay like I have in the past, it's awesome with awesome features.  I'm currently running the free one again due to finances but I still enjoy the great service Pandora has to offer."
45544,"Pandora",2014-05-20,5,"AWSOME!!!!!!   This is an awesome app you can get your own music! This has nothing to do with this app but thee one thing that I hats is that the kindle makes thou put in a rule about how many words you can have when you write a review."

45571,"Pandora",2012-09-22,5,"Love it!   I love Pandora! I use it all the time and it provides a great selection of music unlike the radio which repeats constantly. A bunch of people say they don't like it because of the adds; but there is a thirty second or less add every five or more songs; so that is not a good complaint. I give it five stars completly!"
45575,"Pandora",2012-06-03,5,"da best   Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music!  you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like,  I love it && I'm positive u will too :)"

45674,"Pandora",2013-08-17,4,"ok   This is a great app. But, it would be even better if you could keep listening to the same song over and over again. That is why I just gave it 4 stars. Sometimes it doesn't work, though. Otherwise it is the best music app in my opinion."
45679,"Pandora",2012-11-19,5,"Listen to it ...Love it   LOVE Pandora.  It is a great way to hear your favorite artists but also learn about new artists and tracks that are very similar.

45797,"Pandora",2011-11-15,4,"like it, but has its flaws   I have the paid version.  the free version became pointless because of the commercials, just like spotify and terrestrial radio.  the biggest flaw of pandora in the android/fire version is the lack of a way to filter out bands that you don't like...unless it's right in front of me and I didn't see it."

45803,"Pandora",2013-08-01,3,"It's ok!   I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it's better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist"

46727,"Pandora",2013-04-14,5,"love it   this is an amazing app free radio even on the road and personalized radio stations better then I heart radio."
46730,"Pandora",2012-05-13,4,"great, but wish I could see the song that had just been playing if I miss it   great, but I would love it if I was able to see the song that just played. I often miss it and then it is gone until it plays again, which rarely happens"

46743,"Pandora",2012-03-24,5,"best music stations   Pandora has the best music stations. Our favorite is Nat King Cole. We have had many hours of beautiful music from Pandora.  Highly recommended.  Five stars."
46750,"Pandora",2012-12-13,2,"boo   its a good app overall, but sometimes it just stops playing, and you have to change station in order for the app to work..."
46752,"Pandora",2013-02-16,4,"ok   this isn't my favorite app.when I type in a song it plays a different song.but everything else is very good on it."
46753,"Pandora",2013-03-23,4,"Love it!   I use Pandora on my Kindle Fire at work to help me focus on my work. It keeps me in a good mood all day long."
46759,"Pandora",2016-08-02,3,"used to be a bit more helpful...   I used to not have it acting weird, but now, when I quit and come back in, it looks as though it was up the whole time.Worse, though, is how it can be playing, but when I open it to check song title or something, I have to joggle it on the screen side to side in order for the correct title and artist to be displayed, instead of a prior one."
46762,"Pandora",2013-02-07,5,"Great Listening!   I listen to Pandora while im at the gym. I enjoy mixed music depending on my mood and I get just that with Pandora"

47006,"Pandora",2015-01-09,5,"Once you go Pandora, no other apps will get to store ya (identity). (corny I know, but I'm tired and its catchy)   Great app especially if you pay the extra 5 bucks a month for the plus edition. I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?"

It's quick and easy, good for people who don't have an extensive music collection already, or people who what to hear something different every now and then."
47018,"Pandora",2012-01-14,1,"cant create playlists?   you cant create new playlists on this app. you can only listen to ones you've already made on the computer website, or the holy ipad.. how has this not been fixed yet? its like these guys have created a camera app where you cant actuatlly TAKE pictures, you can only look at ones you've taken on other devices...."
47022,"Pandora",2011-10-25,3,"Could be better.   Ads only get worse and there is still no don't play for a month options. They don't seem to add new features, just new ways to deliver ads."

47208,"Pandora",2012-01-15,1,"sneaky sneaky, greasy greasy   on my 7"" tablet the 'x' to dismiss the ad is so small I end up hitting it only 10% of the time.  the other 90% I accidentally hit the af itself.  this really sucks since instead of dismissing an ad that is annoying enough that I want it gone, ot actually navigates to the full page and pays the advertiser for a click to an annoying pos ad.  the music service is good though."
47211,"Pandora",2017-02-19,1,"Never again, so don't ask.   You'll never getting another review out me again. Positive or negative. You can suck it!"

47222,"Pandora",2013-08-28,1,"Where's the alternative?   Terrible, can't get passed 3 songs without a commercial. Years ago it was much better. Where's the alternative? And the limitations on skipping are terrible."

47231,"Pandora",2013-07-01,4,"Curses   it's  good but pandora curses. you can also only have a certain amount of skips but it is ok. i do like how you can create stations and flip through them. you can also use it on the interweb which is also very helpful"

47251,"Pandora",2017-04-16,4,"Awesome   I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that's really annoying when it's one of my favorites... otherwise it's Amazing!!"

47372,"Pandora",2012-09-19,1,"no, you may not email my mom   ...and I can't imagine why anyone would let you. these permissions are insane. I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."
47373,"Pandora",2012-01-01,5,"beyonce   like beyonce cause she.is a great singer and she where nice close and she having.Baby I. remember that when she was young she became destiny child three girls but.two left then they found a.new two girls.one. left so now.it was two when they was.doing.there on.thang they.came.back. so now there no.more destiny child."

47387,"Pandora",2011-10-17,5,"I am would give it nine stars   I would give this nine stars, just like the nine nine nine plan. The 999 plan replaces the tax code with the simple but effective 999 plan. Pandora is great because it shows you new artists like the ones you love"
47392,"Pandora",2012-02-01,1,"kindles interference with ability of tablet   This tablet is being changed to block my ability to access websites I prefer. I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone."
47396,"Pandora",2016-04-10,3,"Great app, but...   It exits the app after I listen to it for 30 to 45 minutes, I have to reopen and can't continue listening to the song that was playing before! If you fix this then I will gladly give a five star rating!"
47399,"Pandora",2011-12-01,2,"other radio apps better   Navigation quirky. Ads all-pervasive. Sound quality mediocre. Maybe good if you're already a Pandora fan. Otherwise, skip it. Uninstalling from my Kindle fire."

47421,"Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"spotify is great   Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin  music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
47424,"Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"The ony music app you neec   I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."

47450,"Spotify",2015-09-08,4,"Good service, great app, disappointing business model   The app is great. Nice design and interface. It's easy to learn and a good service, but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone. I think it's a bit inconvenient that my phone/phablet doesn't have the same access to songs without shuffle, as a tablet does."
47455,"Spotify",2014-11-27,4,"Almost Awsome   I love the fact that this is free and our favorite music I shared spotify with all of my friends but here comes the negative thing tablets don't call out of state with a bid ass screen it should be music anywhere for free no internet.

Nice app for organizing music but don't like the idea that in order to listen off line need to pay for premium. Disappointing . I  won't be paying 10 $ a month. Maybe once and done. Where can I find a free app besides iTunes thats free???"
47510,"Spotify",2014-12-14,4,"very pleasant   I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood.  Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."

Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can't play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."
47568,"Spotify",2017-05-30,5,"R&B and rap   It gives a playlist of different artists you like and let's you make a playlist of only songs you like.😜👌🏀"

47588,"Spotify",2014-11-08,5,"Love Spotify but...   Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring."
47597,"Spotify",2014-09-02,3,"fire phone user   This app has lots of great music however I'm in a dead zone so if I'm not in my house where I have Wi-Fi I can't listen to it which means running and other outdoor activities are very quiet.  It tells me to update to premium so I can use it offline but when I search for the premium I can't find it.  How can I update to premium if it's not available?"

Or you can create your own playlists with whatever theme you choose. Unlike other apps, you can choose what artists, and what songs, you want on your lists."
47648,"Spotify",2016-08-01,5,"all the hits any time!!!!!   I really enjoy being able to listen to any song I want  anytime  and if you don't have premium, the advertisements aren't that consistent ( as in not every song), really great app."
47649,"Spotify",2015-11-07,5,"one of the best   Spotify is by far one of the best music apps out there. I haven't had any issues with the functionality, and the library is extensive. I am finding all the music I had with Google play plus some.  Would certainly recommend giving this one a try."

47731,"Spotify",2015-10-18,4,"just about   I would give it 5 stars but I used the free play load to see if buying the downloads wold be a good thing to buy so I did and now I want to buy it but I can't because it said I bought it but I haven't and I would be happy if u fixed it thank u"
47732,"Spotify",2015-12-29,5,"amazing!!!!!   I have would rate this infinity stars If I could but there is only one problem it needs to be connected to WiFi and if u want WiFi u have to pay for premium but the rest of it is amazing !!it has lots of songs and easy to use"

47751,"Spotify",2015-04-16,5,"I love Spotify!   I love Spotify!! I previously had IHeart and Pandora installed on my phone and tablet, respectively,  but quickly removed them after installing Spotify.

47753,"Spotify",2014-10-22,5,"Way to go Spotify!!!   This is a great app so far. I am able to find all the artists and music that I am interested in easily and quickly. The sound is great and I can't believe that all this is from a free app. The few ads that broadcast periodically are worth enduring for the quality of this service.........and, IT'S FREE!!  Way to go Spotify!"
47756,"Spotify",2015-10-29,5,"Works really well and provides and awesome service!   Greatest music app on the planet! I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user (student) and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I don't regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you're like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.*One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it doesn't have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content (and don't want to monitor it closely) that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I don't know a workaround."
47759,"Spotify",2017-08-12,5,"My favorite app   I love that I can listen to the music I like anywhere with this app"
47768,"Spotify",2016-12-02,5,"Great music app   Excellent Excellent . From listening on my phone to through my hifi via spotify connect this the my favourite app. Nothing else to say really"
47774,"Spotify",2014-12-21,4,"Good way to enjoy music.   Great way to listen to listen to music without having to pay any thing. I wish it had a sleep timer like Pandora. If I wasn't already paying for Pandora, I would probably pay for this and get it commercial free. But the commercials are not long or frequent. And paying gives you the option to listen offline."
47781,"Spotify",2017-06-17,5,"Five Stars   Awesome source for music!!!"
47782,"Spotify",2014-08-05,5,"i was wrong about pandora,and iheartradio this one is the best   This one you can choose your favorite songs and you can save them and they are different varieties to pick and different genres. Just don't log out of this app you can press the home button and it still saves but don't press.the log out button or all your songs will delete and you will have to start all over on your fav list of songs. :)"
47784,"Spotify",2015-07-23,5,"Im not sure why this is showing up on my Amazon list...   Im not sure why this is showing up on my Amazon list, but since it did I must say that this is the most powerful innovation of the last decade.I dont know what I would do without it.

47808,"Spotify",2015-02-28,4,"What a Way To Improve on a Music Apps   A bit redundant at first, then it picks up and appears to provide more variety than its competitor Pand. It also provides more opportunities at ad-free listening than P. I have yet to upgrade to their premium service but I think it's a definite improvement over my previous go-to music app."
47812,"Spotify",2017-02-13,5,"It's Great   Great experience with the spotify app the music plays crisp and smooth plus you get to checkout other playlist and remixes of music."
47815,"Spotify",2016-02-04,5,"MUSIC RULES   Great choices for music genres, radio, and new music.  Not interrupted too much for announcements, etc.  I use Spotify Music more often because of the variety of music and search for music I want to look for."

47829,"Spotify",2014-12-28,5,"Excelent app   The best music app for me. I can listen any song I want."
47831,"Spotify",2015-07-01,4,"The best music app ever but.......   Great app I have too admit, but the stupid ads get so annoying especially when in the middle of your song."
47832,"Spotify",2015-02-10,5,"love   Easy way to listen!!"
47834,"Spotify",2015-11-03,2,"what happened?!   I used to love this app but got locked out of my account. I created a new one but it was DIFFERENT. I had to shuffle a bunch of different songs in order to get to the one I want! Not only that but I can't skip tracks.  Please fix"
47838,"Spotify",2014-08-26,5,"Great App   I think Spotify Music is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their own custom playlist but doesn't want to pay for the music. Spotify has all the songs I love and I really enjoy having this app, it's similar to Pandora, but with Spotify  the music playing is all you're choice. I hope that my review was helpful, thank you!"

47847,"Spotify",2015-05-26,4,"Good for a Free App, But There Are Some Playback Issues   This is a free app, so it's hard to complain too much. I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire HD. It loads quickly and has all the features you need for Spotify on a tablet. Unfortunately, there are a few playback issues. Three main examples:1. Songs often skip or have annoying pops.2. When using the shuffle feature for an artist, the app seems to play the same few songs over and over (and mostly from the artist's most recent albums).3. The app often stops playing music when using another program on the Kindle. For example, if I am browsing the internet, the app sometimes quits halfway through a song and has to be restarted.Overall, this app has some challenges to overcome, but it gets the job done most of the time. After all, if I'm listening from my Kindle Fire, I'm not exactly in search of a premier audio listening experience."
47853,"Spotify",2016-08-24,5,"Great app   Best music app out there"
47862,"Spotify",2015-09-29,5,"five star app   I was so happy when my sister told me about this app. I like to listen to music while I work so it was nice not having to find a new song on YouTube every time a song ended. Get Spotify if you dont have pandora on your hand held device."

47880,"Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"spotify is a must have..   Awesome when u have premium...  but it is also very cool if you don't want to spend the money to get premium.

49252,"Spotify",2014-09-28,2,"Not what I was looking for   I saw the good reviews and decided to try it out, but I was disappointed.

49253,"Spotify",2015-02-19,4,"Free version is a must!   Great app, free version is a must. Customize a playlist and play it on shuffle. Free version does require internet.Cons: paid version is too pricey IMO when compared to other sources like prime music or Pandora"
49255,"Spotify",2015-03-28,5,"Best music app   You can do shuffle play or just look up a song. You can also see what is popular and listen to that. There is also a browsing section that starts broad and narrows it down if you don't know what to listen to."
49257,"Spotify",2015-09-16,3,"it was good...   It was good until they updated it so now you have to pay to skip songs unlimeted! Now you can only do shuffle if you haven't played for the premium. Other wise I love it."

49306,"Spotify",2015-01-06,5,"Great - Like using on a computer with free skips and selection   Spotify as an app is 100% superior on the Kindle because you don't need Prime to pick the songs!

49894,"Spotify",2014-11-03,5,"I Love Both the Service and the App   I love music of every genre, from the Jesus Music heydays in the 1970s and 80s to classical to American blues. Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I don't remember why, but it made sense at the time.So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs (in general). I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended. I'll live. I'm happy I have this.Anthony Trendlanthonytrendl.com"

I'm NOT the one to be rating this app.  I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes.  In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded.So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow.  MUSE.  The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs.  The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies)  So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group.  hahaha.  Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues.  And sounded pretty good with earphones on.  So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

I don't have a bad thing to say.I have read a couple things here that are simply untrue or out dated. You can play ANY song from your play lists, turn your device to wide screen and you will see the song list. If you would like to listen to your purchased music, use a different app, this is a steaming music service.Couldn't be happier. Unless Spotify breaks itself or goes bankrupt, no more Pandora."

53291,"Spotify",2014-11-19,4,"wonderful except for compatibility issues   I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info.Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again."

53304,"Spotify",2014-08-14,4,"The sound quality is great (not excellent   I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."

However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

53422,"Spotify",2016-04-23,4,"Things to be worked on   Spotify is a great app for listening to your favorite songs. Being able tomake playlists that have songs you already like gives it a slight edge over Pandora. Since both are free and use ads to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really comes down to whether you feel knowing what songs are going to play versus getting introduced to new songs you might like. While Spotify does both, it doesn't really do the latter as often, where Pandora is entirely that. Really it comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for. If you want to know what is going to play based on a playlist you created go with Spotify, but if you want more of a radio deal go Pandora. Both have things they could improve on. Now as for both apps' premium upgrades Spotify, in my opinion, has more bang for your buck. You have the ability to skip and amount of songs,peak and see what is up next, have no ads, and download songs or playlists to your device for offline listening. This means you don't have to have signal nor do you have to use so much data. In my own opinion Spotify and Pandora are great apps for the type of music provider they are. Honestly if you can't choose between them, get both! If you already do and what to go premium on one go with Spotify, because it offers more in my opinion, although it is more expensive than Pandora."

You can look up any artist, song, or album, and Spotify will probably have it. There's rarely any adds, and you can save whichever music you like to your personal library. The only downfall is that you need wifi to be able to use it, but if you get premium, you can listen to your personal music whenever, wherever. Overall, it's a great app."

Music quality is a big issue for me, but this app has the best quality I've ever had on a free app. The only thing I really dislike about it is the fact that you can't change the EQ on a kindle fire. I tap on it and gives me a warning saying something about different EQ settings can change volume level and then closes! Why can't I change the EQ?!? I can on my IPod!"

When I found music for hula hooping I was impressed. The station is wonderful. You can never listen to all the music at once. It didn't come and ask are you still listening it just pays until you stop it. I recommend it for real music lovers. I love all the gospel, praise, worship and instrumental music.

55867,"Spotify",2014-10-23,5,"this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ...   Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"

55877,"Spotify",2015-12-07,5,"awesome   Super great"
55878,"Spotify",2014-09-25,5,"Best music app ever.   Spotify is amazing. I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

I decided to go for it, as I don't have a very big music collection . It has completely changed my relationship to the music world, although I'm worried that I'm no longer listening to radio at all . They have practically everything I ever look for , and with premium you get excellent quality and no ads . HOWEVER I do think they could do a better job with the Kindle interface , giving you more options for how to organise your library , for example. Mine is getting quickly out of control!"

56310,"Spotify",2014-08-27,4,"good app   This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I don't pay for it there's ads but when I'm listening to death metal and deathcore, I don't want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

56510,"Spotify",2014-12-24,5,"Great   Premium is great even without it, it has more choices than Pandora"
56512,"Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People don't understand this amazing app.   This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)"

56594,"Spotify",2017-03-29,4,"Needs to update it's music   I'm listening to Spotify as I write this, and as a whole it's a good app, even with the new update. There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. Don't take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I don't appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it's a good music app."

I get to listen to a hundred times more songs, I make my own playlists, and the best part.. ITS FREE (unless you upgrade to the premium) Honestly, I am thinking about upgrading to premium myself, bc it just has a ton of cool qualities.. For one, I think that downloading the playlists of songs of your choice, and being able to listen to it WITHOUT WiFi, is THE BEST THING EVER!!!It's just THT it's on premium.. :/ but the free version is practically amazing in every way except that ONE thing....********GeT tHiS aPp RiGhT nOw!¡!¡!¡!¡!"

I've looked for an app that allows me to play my own playlist of songs and hand pick songs I want to listen to whenever, this is that app. If you're like me and don't wanna listen to playlists based off one musician you like, Spotify is the app for you. Create your own playlist, listen to whatever you want whenever you want. If you do like listening to playlists, Spotify has that as well. If I could give it more than five stars, I would, but for now, 5 STARS! Keep up the awesomeness Spotify!"

I do still have adds though but that's not that bad.Cons: 1. The premium cost ten dollars a month!

I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes"

On kindle it lets you pick any track. but listening on my android phones sucks. Because you can't pick any tracks . you can just pick songs ,  but the downside it plays a random track and also plays songs that aren't on your playlist. But on kindle you don't have that problem. I give it 4.9 stars out of 5 for listening on kindle. And 2/5 stars on android phone. I don't know how it work on apple. But on kindle I love it."

58168,"Spotify",2016-03-11,5,"Great music app   Great music app. I've had premium for years. One thing I don't like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded, it will change to a different version. ie:I've had ""Walk the Line"" by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time, then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song, it was a live version, rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers, instrumentals, or live versions. Other than that, I love everything about this app."

58176,"Spotify",2015-01-26,5,"great app   Great app!"
58185,"Spotify",2015-07-22,5,"This is genius!   Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

I just can't understand how they expect someone to pay for this service when it has so many malfunctions, for me anyway.  For example I have to log in and out so it doesn't freeze up, and I have to turn WIFI on and off so it doesn't freeze up.  This is on Multiple computers so it's not just me.  Why would I pay for that especially 10 a month.I could get Amazon prime with music/TV/movies/STORAGE/shipping for 99 a year or I could get a ""spotty"" service like Spotify for 120 a year, you be the judge."

What I love too, is it helps you find music you like, and it has most every song you can think of. It also has a bunch of different music indie, dubstep, metal, rock, rap, emo, pop, Mozart, alternative (my favorite), and more! In a nutshell, if you like music but don't want to spend your money on discs and other things like that, you'll love this. Best thing is it's free! All you need is an internet.connection."

58723,"Spotify",2015-07-14,2,"So far, no sale   I have not had a very good experience so far, though I do like the theoretical convenience of music at your fingertips. I did not find the interface intuitive or easy to use:  Like most things on the Internet, it is easy once you know how to do it.  I found that it was playing random things not even closely related to what I was selecting.  I am certainly not ready to sign up for the paid subscription yet."
58727,"Spotify",2016-03-11,3,"Options button doesn't work   I like the app, but the three dot option button is way to close to the playlist scrollbar. So when I want to remove a song from a playlist, the app thinks I'm trying to scroll to a different place in the list. Please fix this Spotify!!!Other than that the app  is ok. I do strongly recommend that there should always be clean versions of all content instead of just some. on iTunes, the user can pick to see Clean or Explicit versions of songs. They should have this on Spotify too. Or maybe they could just have a clean versions alongside the explicit version.Also there should be an alarm clock feature. If there already us it should be easier to find. If there is not, please add it!Thanks Spotify!"

58762,"Spotify",2014-07-10,5,"Five Stars   New great"
58763,"Spotify",2014-06-24,5,"Great   I love Spotify! The premium is so much better but a bit expensive. I highly recommend this as a music source for PC, Tablet and phone."
58772,"Spotify",2017-06-12,2,"I miss Napster.   Terrible user interface.  I try to play a song on my phone, but it plays on my Alexa upstairs (apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on). Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song, and then play that.  I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times, but, boy, do I miss Napster."
58779,"Spotify",2015-09-10,2,"New Update   This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can't take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can't play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song (usually not the one I want) and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it's just a crappy update."
58783,"Spotify",2015-12-20,3,"its okay   I said I s okay because at first when I got I was so happy because now I could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so I downloaded it to my iPhone but when I clicked a song it would play another song and I found that very anoyoing and once I was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and I tryed to quickly turn it of however when I use spotifiy on my iPad it always plays the  song that I want to hear it always plays that song but then there's an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now I don't know if its my only my iPhone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying"
58787,"Spotify",2015-09-14,3,"Decent, but not perfect.   I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
58791,"Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"Best Music Streaming Service!   Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums (heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to!) from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you're able to listen to your music - commercial free."
58796,"Spotify",2016-12-09,5,"5 star selection   I can always find music I enjoy! Thanks!"
58797,"Spotify",2016-10-29,4,"Great Choice of Music   gives new music, albums, and singles. Love it. Hate the Mobile version though that's the only thing."
58800,"Spotify",2016-07-18,2,"Could not upload audio CD data   We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device.  Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD (from our physical home library).  It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so.  In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running.  In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service."
58802,"Spotify",2016-04-03,5,"soifily   Bc it's the best in the world you can play music off line it's awesome"
58803,"Spotify",2016-03-07,5,"Let There Be Rock!   Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse & worse until the point of being unbearable when it wouldn't even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement & came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues & they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
58804,"Spotify",2016-02-17,5,"Get it. Srsly   Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."
58808,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"Change it back!!!   I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only &#34;premium subscribers&#34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! Don't tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."
58809,"Spotify",2016-08-16,3,"It would have been wayyyyy better   Ugh there ok, I got premium for free for three months, but after a couple off weeks I would play about three songs in a row, and the song stops playing and I would constantly have to press play. I asked a friend of mine if he had experienced that problem and he had too. I know it's not my connection because of other music apps I play. Get that fixed and then I'll think about purchasing Premium."
58817,"Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!!   This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
58823,"Spotify",2015-10-19,3,"Uh...   This app was great, we all know it.But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"
58825,"Spotify",2016-06-12,5,"omg   Best app ever I love it u can listen to the music easily and quickly and Iove how u can make ur own play list but I wish it was for free for u to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but I loveee itt !!!!"

58828,"Spotify",2016-08-30,5,"Spot On   I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections.  Very easy to use.  I am 63 years young and still rock in.  Which we had this in my school years, beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
58830,"Spotify",2017-02-16,5,"Amazing   Amazing a lot better than Pandora"
58831,"Spotify",2016-11-22,5,"Well Worth the Price   I  love using Spotify. I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith.  I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly.  Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips."
58833,"Spotify",2017-04-29,5,"Sweet Little Music App   Great stations. Great variety! LOVE this app!"
58839,"Spotify",2016-10-11,5,"I'm my own DJ!!!   I have been impressed with Spotify and the choices in songs available to me!  I love creating my playlist to fit my moods and activities.  Sometimes I feel nostalgic and want to hear an all 80's line-up to listen and remember.  But other times I just want to work out to Springsteen,  Billy Joel, Elton John and too many more to list!  With Spotify I can personalize my playlists any way I want.  When you've got a must have song and you want it to appear several times throughout the playlist?  You can make that happen with Spotify!  I can even listen to my Christian music all day long and never run out of song choices.  You can even listen to playlists that have already been put together if you don't want to create your own.  Add songs or remove songs anytime to make a playlist truly your own!  Gotta love it!"

58855,"Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well   Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen .  .  . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
58857,"Spotify",2014-06-24,4,"Super   Love it!!!  Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it.  Have suggested it to a couple friends that didn't know about it."
58858,"Spotify",2017-04-28,5,"Great music app   I love this app and it's premium. All in all its easy to use and has most songs! 😃😃"
58860,"Spotify",2016-12-26,3,"Really???!!!   I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can't get this. I still have it but I'm really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I'll get rid of it and I really don't want to because I like it but if you don't fix it's gonna go :/"
58870,"Spotify",2017-03-23,3,"Great, but...   Spotify is amazing, except for the fact that every time I open it, it says there's no internet connection, when there CLEARLY is. Because of this, I have had to (for the past two weeks) delete the app almost daily (1-2 times) and redownload it. It frustrates me how slow it is sometimes and I am contemplating on whether I should delete Spotify for good. On the other hand, I use it every time I use my tablet (it's great to use while getting ready!) I enjoy that you can make playlists, follow them, save songs, etc. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys listening to music frequently, but be aware if it says there's no internet connection. I don't know if it's just my tablet or not, to be honest. ✨"
58877,"Spotify",2017-02-21,5,"Crazy Song app   Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that."
58878,"Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"I always use this app!   I was looking for good music apps and I don't really like pandora...it doesn't have enough skips and u don't know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this 10 stars if I could!"
58885,"Spotify",2016-10-12,4,"Great!!   This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome."
58886,"Spotify",2014-11-23,2,"They pissed  me off!   This app is great but my favorite artist was taken down, like all of her good country songs and now they only have her stupid pop songs. I need my Taylor swift back!"
58890,"Spotify",2017-05-09,5,"Epic   I dance to my music now"
58893,"Spotify",2016-12-11,5,"This app is awesome   This app is awesome!! You can pick any song you want to listen too. You can listen to new hits or the 50's. One thing is, the songs that have curse words in them say it and they don't block it out, so I wouldn't pick songs that have curse words in it. Good luck!"
58896,"Spotify",2014-07-23,2,"Free with a catch   GREAT if you don't mind NOT choosing your own songs even ones you own.  I find it annoying that you can't play a specific song unless you have a one song playlist and even then you get the crummy suggestion.I like Pandora better personally. I can at least listen to the one song I want to hear or someone else hear without issue. Spotify on the pc is the way to go.$10 a month premium is just too much would rather watch movies for that kind of money."
58898,"Spotify",2016-05-17,3,"HOW DO I GET PREMIUM?!   This app is cool! I got the free trial for spotify premium but it ended. How do I upgrade it to premium?!?! PLEASE HELP! IM NOT ENJOYING IT AS WELL!!!"

58918,"Spotify",2016-02-03,2,"Not only is the premium service only worth the money ...   Not only is the premium service only worth the money if I'm using it on mobile but the free version is so irritating it basically forces you to upgrade. While it's perfectly reasonable for ads to play when using a free service I noted two things recently after years of using it: 1) an average of three adds ran in between each song - a rate that even Pandora never uses and 2) ads ran when I played my own local files."
58920,"Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"A must have app for your music   Love Love it...Every song I have requested has always been available...Thanks for providing us with the best music app out there!!"
58922,"Spotify",2015-09-11,4,"Pretty awesome app.   I am officially a hooked on Spotify listener/ user. I love the variations in stations, weather it be in genres or moods, Spotify has it ALL! I particularly like the Discovery Weekly playlist which stays in tuned with what you like listening to, keeps you up to speed with fresh music and a lil hint of older hits.Definitely recommend Spotify to others to experience, listen and enjoy its splendor! 😉🙌😁🎶🎵📻🎧"

58924,"Spotify",2014-06-19,5,"Spotify is Spot On!   Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better!  The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch.  Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me.  Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!"

58936,"Spotify",2016-01-15,5,"Take advantage of the 3 month trial!   I love Spotify! I am currently taking advantage of the .99 3 month trial. The benefits are wonderful. No commercials and no data usage. It's not worth the higher monthly fee to me once the trial expires so at that point I will be cancelling premium and going back to the free version. It doesn't use a ton of data and I can deal with the commercials to have the ability to choose my favorite music!"

58956,"Spotify",2017-04-13,3,"Good, but buggy on Kindle   On any other device, I would probably give this a 5/5, but there are certain bugs on the Kindle that desperately need fixing. For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."

58965,"Spotify",2015-11-17,2,"What Happened??   I have been using this app for almost a year, and I loved it. Now though the stupid thing will not let me chose a song unless I pay for it what the hell I am not dealing with this it I wanted a limited number of skips and to not be able to chose the song I would have use I heart radio or Pandora. This is soo not my favourite app anymore, back to youtube it is."
58966,"Spotify",2016-12-07,5,"Great free music and podcasts   Great free music and podcasts.  Spotify does have a no add premium option for a monthly cost but I don't mind the ads for free music I can choose. Huge variety, categories and specialized mood/activity lists. Good way to keep up on the new and upcoming artists. Also fun to check out unexplored genres and podcasts. Overall great service!"
58969,"Spotify",2016-11-20,4,"Love my Spotify!   Sure, I wish Spotify was less expensive or totally free!  Who doesn't?!  Although it stops playing and I can't figure out why.  Sometimes, it won't allow my ""play next/que"" to work properly!  And that makes me very sad!The monthly charge needs to be cheaper!  Play next should Always be free!"
58970,"Spotify",2016-12-15,5,"Perfect   The best music library of any service.  Music discovery is very robust, either by searching popular songs by artists or by the Spotify curated playlists."
58974,"Spotify",2016-10-29,2,"More Restrictions   It used to be great but it's getting more and more restricted.  The app won't let you connect to external speakers without paying which seems unfair.  I'd rather just use Pandora."
58977,"Spotify",2014-06-25,4,"Spotify Review   THIS APP IS AMAZING... I have this also for my computer and Ipod.. The one part I hate about it on my kindle fire is that you cannot pick what song you want to listen to it is just a shuffle play unless you want to pay. You get a certain amount of skips and I didn't know that so I just wasted all of them thinking I had unlimited."

I had to go a couple months without premium and it seemed as bad as listening to Pandora, but the premium is definitely worth the $9.99 a month in my opinion. Definitely one app I rather not go without."

The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's wasn't available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify.  (Of course, for what amounts to $120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that's not available on Prime.)  Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like.  From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."

59472,"Spotify",2015-09-09,1,"this app was great... then they did an update and now it sucks   So an a phone, you had to play music on shuffle if u didn't have premium. On a tablet or laptop, you could play whichever song want. With the new terms and conditions update, you cannot play a certain song, you have to use shuffle play. The only reason I used this app was because I could listen to a specific song without paying for it. Now I'm deleting this app because I have no further use for it."
59475,"Spotify",2014-08-27,1,"Not worth the monthly sub   $9.95 a month does not justify the lack of songs that this thing has. Granted that with Sprint, depending on your plan, you can get this free for six months. It was okay if you live in NA, SA, and EU. It does not have enought JPop and KPop to have me pay $9.95 a month. Pandora is much cheaper and has what I like to listen to."
59479,"Spotify",2015-01-05,1,"Used to be OK   I am using a payed Spotify service for several years now, making playlists and collecting my 'own music'. When BlackBerry Q10 arrived they stopped supporting this platform, but I managed to find a client that still did the job verry well. Since this week I was forced to move to the latest version in the app store here (old version was 'not supported anymore'). Now my BlackBerry passport crashes all the time, offline mode can't be activated anymore and I need to login everytime I start up Spotify + battery drains... Ones you are addicted they take advantage of you. Make your own playlists with your own music in the device's native client and realize the control you lose when these cloudbased solutions are out of the 'yes we have another customer mode!' and leave you in the dark without access to what feels like your music collection!"

59488,"Spotify",2015-11-09,1,"Not family-friendly...   While I do like that Spotify, unlike Pandora, plays what you actually search for right off the bat, I chose to stick with Pandora as it allows you to filter out explicit content. True, Spotify will play edited albums if you search for them,  but there's no telling what else will start playing in that station. I used up all of my skips and still got stuck with a song that swore a lot (that was just on an Angels & Airwaves station. They rarely swear but I was playing an edited album just to be safe). If Pandora's license allows them to give users the option to filter explicit content, surely Spotify should be able to as well."

Now I understand that a mobile version of the website is going to necessarily be less flexible than the site.  I get that.  But why I'm limited to shuffle play, I don't understand.  Surely that's not a huge memory issue?Here's the thing, I'm a writer..  I put together playlists for each piece I work on and listen to them as I write.  I take a lot of time deciding what the right flow is on my playlists, and hearing them shuffled kind of defeats the whole process.  Yeah, I find it irritating and it's pretty much put paid to the idea of using Spotify on my phone or tablet unless I'm just going to do some random listening."

Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame."

Can't find record stores like the old days, but for a better price, you can have any and all albums from almost any artist you can imagine. Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past. I see more and more Car stereo decks hitting the scene without CD players but set up for USB, auxiliary input, SD card and Bluetooth. Spotify is THE S#!T !!!!!!!!"

59912,"Spotify",2015-07-17,4,"I love this app! But...   Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD)I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"
59913,"Spotify",2017-04-29,1,"I wish I could give this -0 stars😤 GET RID OF UPGRADE   DO NOT GET THIS APP IT SUCKS. The stupid upgrade that I have to get ruins everything because THERE IS NO UPGRADE ANYWHERE. Ever since  they asked for the new upgrade you have to get they don't let you play songs, at least not a song you want to play, you can't download anything, play any songs on your playlists, I've had this app for 3 years yet they just lost a loyal customer, GET RID OF THE UPGRADE JERKS.

59921,"Spotify",2014-08-08,5,"Coolio   Spotify is AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I would say it is much better than Pandora and Iheart radio. You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too!  You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups  and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify!  @loviemonsters!"

60030,"Spotify",2017-01-25,3,"Eh   when I press login it freezes"
60033,"Spotify",2014-10-02,5,"Replace Pandora?   I've only been on Spotify for a week now, but I think this may replace Pandora as my favorite music app.  Like Pandora, you create your own stations.  However, you can pick only the songs you want to hear right from the beginning.  It's not like you ""seed""the station with a song or artist, then watch it go into crazy directions.  Yes, it only shows a certain amount of skips, but if you create your own playlist with the songs you want, then it really isn't a big deal.  In addition, you do have to hear the occasional advertisement, but they are few and far between.The big difference to me is the cost of premium membership.  I believe Pandora charges about $30/year, while Spotify is $10/month.  That is a huge difference, however Spotify let's you not only listen without interruption, but you can skip to your heart's content, and listen to ALL your favorite songs.  AWESOME!Despite the advantages, I think I'll stick to the free version.  Just can't justify $120/year for music."
60037,"Spotify",2017-02-28,4,"Great, but takes up too much space too fast   I absolutely love this app. I've tried many others and in my opinion, this is the best. The only problem iis that it takes up too much space in so little songs. If there is a way to fix that, I would love it. Thank you for an otherwise great app."
60038,"Spotify",2016-06-15,5,"AWESOME APP   I really really love this app better then Pandora or any other music app that I have tried"

60046,"Spotify",2016-11-14,5,"Spotify is the go-to music app   Spotify is the best go-to music app available.  I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed.  I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop.  I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data.  There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists,  which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder.  It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"
60051,"Spotify",2017-02-03,5,"AMAZING   This is a wonderful appYou can pick any song you want you just type the songs name then it will show different artist who made a song with that title and I bet you 100 percent your song you want wiil pop up"

I LOVE spotify it works awesomely on My android and my computer but on my kindle I'm lucky to get it to play one song it freezes up somtimes or it will tell me that the song is unavailable or like right now it's telling me that the song is playing but it's not no sound is coming out I really wish it would work I listen to it all the time with my phone but on my kindle I have to listen to Pandora please fix it"
60060,"Spotify",2016-07-10,5,"Highly Recommend It   I love spotify. It lets you enjoy music while doing other things and when you go on YouTube/internet or games it will automatically pause. You can pick your own songs by searching them and adding them to playlists and you can listen to other peoples playlists by looking them up. You should definitely check it out."
60063,"Spotify",2016-06-08,4,"A Great Music App.   I just recently discovered this app. It is great! You can choose any genre that you feel like listening to. You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you'll start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time. There is every kind of music you can think of ."

60065,"Spotify",2014-07-28,2,"Read This Before Getting App   If I could figure out how to get premium, I'd rate it 5 stars. Without premium, it's terrible. When you try to activate a premium feature, it just tells you that you can't activate it. It doesn't even tell you how to get premium, and I can't find the premium option anywhere. Unless you know how to get premium, do not get this app because it will be a waste of time."
60067,"Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect gift for my grandson!   He seemed disappointed at first, only downloading the app on his cellular phone, but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots, and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots, as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."

60070,"Spotify",2016-11-03,5,"Rock-solid fan   Anybody who loves music has to have Spotify. This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe.  I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle.  A seemingly endless supply of music.  I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for.  I'm not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there isn't."
60071,"Spotify",2016-04-04,5,"Fantastic!!!!!   I am so in love with Spotify! I can find anything I am in the mood for! Fantaso!!"
60076,"Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"omg it's the best and nothing else is   It works well on a tablet so get it it may ask you for a email"
60077,"Spotify",2016-02-08,4,"Almost got it.  So close.  Mostly perfect.   Very ""manual transmission"" in design.  For some, this is a great thing.  You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save.  I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying,  It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own.  This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying.  This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya.  There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought.  This isn't a criticism of the app itself.  It can only do what it is programmed to do,  But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell.  In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever).  I can live with that."

Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button isn't hit and it won't resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc"
60090,"Spotify",2014-11-24,1,"???????   Was happy for one day with this app...loved it the it decided to only give me the option to shuffle there is no longer a play option for individual songs. I don't want to sit here and wait for the song I want to hear to randomly play!!"

For just over $10.00 a month I can listen to any song pretty much ever created. I get the new radio singles, new albums, singles from weird indie bands I've never heard of, customized playlists, Sunday playlists for when I want to chill, the ability to search by song, artist, or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to (every day, constantly, non-stop), I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you don't have a membership, get one ASAP. This is how music playing should be! I have it installed on my computer, cellphone, and Kindle so I have access to it from literally anywhere. Please and thank you!"

60115,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass.   I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."
60118,"Spotify",2015-03-30,5,"Spotify Premium makes this the best source for music   I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work!Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great."
60121,"Spotify",2014-12-30,1,"not using because of security warning   I downloaded this app from the Amazon app store for my Kindle Fire HDX. At first it worked fine but then when I accessed it, it displayed a dialog box which said: APP COMPATIBILITY:  Unfortunately, this app has not yet been updated to the latest compatibility or security standards.  We have notified the developer and asked them to provide an updated version of this app. If you have any questions please notify our customer support team using the help app .  Then it gave the options to either close or launch anyway.  Considering the broad array of permissions that this app requires in any event,I chose to close it and will not be using it until it is cleared by Amazon.  Wait a minute, they are the ones who ""sold"" it to me in the first place as an app approved for use on the Kindle. Confused yet?  I am!"

But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist (yes, and some new songs). I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
60126,"Spotify",2016-10-06,4,"Great appy   I would honestly give this platform five stars but, the adds are annoying. I don't want to upgrade lol. Great app though. They are always making good quality updates to music and over all stability of this app."

60131,"Spotify",2016-04-19,4,"Newer user...so far so good   I really like spotify music app. Although I am relatively new to this app and will do a follow-up review once I have been using it longer. What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear!  Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it.."

Whether you use the free version or purchase Spotify premium, you will find hours upon hours of enjoyment with this app. You use Facebook to create an account, after which you can share your favorite tracks and playlists with friends. You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists. I will encounter ads every 30 minutes, after which I will have 30 minutes of ad-free music. By purchasing Spotify premium, you can save your playlists offline with no ads, higher quality music, and not having to listen on shuffle mode."
60164,"Spotify",2014-07-20,5,"I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!   I think SPOTIFY is the best music app in the world!!! Why should I get this though you ask, 1. Its toatally free 2. You can get any song in the whole wide world for free 3. Its partly a socail media so you can get followers and stuff based on how much other people like your playlists and songs 4.You can even listen to your playlist and songs offline!!! 5. Also there is remixs,explicit versions, clean versions, and all of that too! So if you still don't believe me try it for you self for FRRREEEEEE!!!!!!!"

I play music CONSTANTLY and Spotify can satisfy your every need with a mere click of a button, from Yo-Yo Ma and Mozart to 60s folk to modern electronica... The premium version is the best $10 a month I can possibly spend.  I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew... I use this gloriois app, new releases to me within minutes of release, and member all the weeks waiting for CDs from the BMG CD club!!! Modern marvel..."

I used to have problems trying to find all kinds of free music downloader apps and apps like pandora... but Spotify really has it all! It is your one stop shop for endless playback, new music, radio options, while being able to follow artists and your friends. I highly recommend this app if you are an avid music listener, you like finding random music, or for just about anyone else out there. It has something for all!!!"

A nice feature being that you can keep it playing while reading or other apps. are going on your Kindle. Great streaming service and a good way to check out new albums before you purchase them on Amazon or other places.  It is a free app. , so give it a shot!  I find the search feature best."
60198,"Spotify",2017-10-10,5,"Caters to musical taste   Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music, and out of  all of them, Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clients’ musical needs by providing a wide selection of music, creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers, Spotify is a great service to try out, especially since they do offer free trials."

It's like trying to drink from a fire hose, but eventually you'll learn how to explore and you'll never have to listen to just a small library of purchased tracks again!The interface is well designed and easy to use. It's almost exactly like it's Android version so no real Fire tablet/phone extras, but still well done. Be sure to go to settings and bump up streaming quality as high as you can with your data plan."

Now I can stream all my Kansas   Thank you, thank you, thank you for fixing the Spotify app!I uploaded it as soon as I got my Kindle Fire back in January. Unfortunately it didn't work at all. I couldn't access my playlists, it wouldn't play more than one song, and it continued to freeze until I finally deleted it.Tried again a few weeks back and I'm overjoyed. Now I can stream all my Kansas, Vanilla Ice, Neil Diamond, and Miranda Lambert happily."

I have not used the app.   I love this app but the new update makes the colors look bad they should go back but it is more efficient I guess. but you have to have wifi or you have to pay like 3.00 a month or something. but it's nice for if you have wifi. although the adds get annoying but I guess they have to make money somehow I mean they have to keep going an  it's not like other apps there are song  for all types of music New and old you just have to search."

I really like this app and at the moment I am looking at christmas playlists and it is awesome I found some really good ones you should also go on and get several playlists before you start listening bc when I first got it I was listening to the same music over and over again and forgot that I can look for other music! REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
60238,"Spotify",2015-10-29,3,"Likes and dislikes don't ever save or change anything   I'm actually really annoyed that I keep having to thumbs down the same exact songs every couple of days. It only saves about 5 songs that I've thumbs-up or down.  I'm so over hearing Adel.It's also a major bummer that it saves the thumbs down when it's an accident, and there's no way to correct it.The screen when listening to a station on the computer is odd. Way too busy.  I'd rather it looked like it does when I'm on my phone; simple with the album artwork, artist and song title and time elapsed on song."
60240,"Spotify",2017-05-20,5,"Same Great Design as Spotify on the Internet   I'm glad I can access Spotify on my Fire Tablet, I used to listen to it all the time at my old job. The quality is just like using it on a web browser, maybe with a few more ads here and there but nothing to complain about."
60242,"Spotify",2016-08-07,5,"I love Spotify!!!!   I love Spotify Music. You can pick the tunes you like, unlike Pandora. I just have the free kind, but I am going to pony up to premium so I can listen offline too. Try it, you've got nothing to lose and great music to listen to."
60248,"Spotify",2015-04-06,5,"AWESOME!   Spotify has revolutionized the exposure to music in my life. I have virtually unlimited access to the music of this world here, can make my own mixes and listen to it on ALL my devices. Perhaps my favorite feature is the recommendations based on what I typically listen to. I have found several artists that I adore and probably would have never known about had not it been for Spotify. Thank you thank you thank you!"
60249,"Spotify",2014-11-23,4,"Love it so far   After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)"
60252,"Spotify",2015-06-29,3,"ALMOST perfect, BUT!   Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the $9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you don't want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
60257,"Spotify",2014-11-30,4,"Great for Music Lovers (Better For Those Subscribed to Spotify Premium!)   Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"
60260,"Spotify",2017-05-15,5,"Spotlfy Is Spot On!   I was using Pandora but for some reason started having problems accessing it so I decided to try Spotify. I'm really pleased with how many more songs there are with each artist, I prefer this to Pandora."
60269,"Spotify",2017-08-12,2,"Good concept, continued weak execution   Spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save. Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."
60271,"Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"pc app   I dont like the Kindle Fire app, because the only thing i can do is listen to music in shuffle. So i tried pc version and it's absolutely baller good, you can listen to music every way you want and when you want. Shuffle, repeat or normally. I recommend this for PC (using Windows 7 dont know how world for Mac users)"
60275,"Spotify",2017-03-09,5,"Great!   Spirit is AWESOME! On the computer. On your phone you are very limited in what you do. Like, you can not choose the song you want. You can only push shuffle play. And some times it chooses a different song that is in your playlist. A positive it is will warn you that the song is explicit. Very nice. Refined it highly because every single song is on it."

It s one of my favorite apps."

60306,"Spotify",2015-09-11,5,"Works... nicely   What is there to say? Spotify on the Amazon Kindle Fire simply works. And it works as it should be. No problems, no hiccups. I love the way to use it as a remote when playing Spotify also on my computer or television. But most of all, it just has my music where I want it. And this app is simple to use, responsive.It should not trying to do more than that - which is what makes it a great app for me."

I love everything about it and have nothing bad to say except I can't stop using it now!"

60336,"Spotify",2015-08-18,5,"Five stars!   I have always loved Spotify! It's free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music. I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!"
60339,"Spotify",2014-12-09,5,"BETTER THAN PANDORA AND I HEART RADIO!!   So much more enjoyable than those other music apps! I like how it's laid out and easy to use.

60427,"Spotify",2017-10-27,5,"Spotify.Com App For The Best Music Anywhere   Spotify perfect for every song you could think of. Spotify.Com is the very best of the best here on Amazon.Com. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great sale here on Amazon.Com Best of the Best"
60429,"Spotify",2015-02-20,5,"The One Stop Music Spot   Spotlight is the best solution I have found to provide the quality, quantity and user friendliness that I expect from a music player. It is on in my life almost 24 hours a day. It allows me access to New artists as well as my age old favorites. I am a premium paying member which allows me access to my music even when I am off-line. I love my Spotify!"
60436,"Spotify",2017-07-16,5,"just awesome   Blows Pandora out of the water. Awesome configurations easy to use, and just awesome."
60439,"Spotify",2016-02-02,4,"pretty good   I love this app I use it everyday my only problem with it is that at first you can only shuffle you can't choose the song and it has to be online or you can't listen to it offline without buying Premium. I don't know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app"
60443,"Spotify",2016-02-16,4,"I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot   I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot . It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site."
60446,"Spotify",2015-12-03,4,"Spotify is a very good free app   I'm using Free Spotify andI like it alot. It stays more true to the genre or artist you choose. This was a real problem with iheart, but in all fairness it's been awhile since I used that app. Pandora used to shut down all the time saying something about getting eaten by a bear. So you'd have to keep going back to the computer to let them know you were still listening."
60448,"Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"Quality Music Player   Awesome product to find any music you want, and organize/order it in any way you want. Find a song you like and listen on repeat, collect your favorites and hit shuffle, or set up your queue to play specific songs in the order you like. Download your favorites if you want to listen offline as well. Never regretted buying this product."
60449,"Spotify",2016-03-31,5,"it is awesome   Spotify is awesome because you get to pick your own music and you get a 30 day free trial of all downloads on Spotify just not where you Getzlaf I premiums and it's also really find that means you will have Pandora add every time you skip that means you don't listen to your song so you like not get recommend it sucks"
60450,"Spotify",2015-01-20,4,"good for a phone   If you have 4g lite it would be a lot better. But if you don't you have to upgrade it but it won't let me. I'd say it's good if you have Wi-Fi."
60458,"Spotify",2017-09-04,5,"It's Great!   Spotify is a great program for multiple reasons. One of them, it's free. Another, you don't have to have it open to listen to music. I definitely recommend it, it's a great program."

60464,"Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"love it   This is the greatest thing ever.i don't buy music any more. I use it at work home and in my car. I use premium, no commercial,plays what ever I feel like and when my selection is over it continues playing based on what I was listening to."
60465,"Spotify",2014-08-01,5,"Awesome   This worked so well. At first I had no hope and thought that computer would be better but I was wrong. Even has Minecraft songs. You can even listen with your tablet and or android off. And to what I see on kindle fire HD it doesn't drain the battery. All you song fans out there who have a favourite song that they just love listening to sell you can listen to your fave song over and over again. I love this app"
60467,"Spotify",2017-06-16,5,"Amazing!   I can listen to anyone I want for free! Plus, there's not that many ads."

60471,"Spotify",2016-09-23,4,"Great App   This is a music app that lets you can make custom music playlists for you to listen to.but there's one issue...you need wifi to use it!you need to get premium membership to download the music and listen to it anywhere.besides that,it's a great app.I highly suggest it."
60473,"Spotify",2015-06-18,5,"LOVE THIS APP!#!!!!!!!   I love this app it is very cool other apps would make you buy the music but in this music app you can just get a artists whole album for free and if you are a kid who is not allowed to have pay for WiFi they can give you three months of premium for just 99 cents get this app it is America axing you can even make your own playlists  and everything just get this app it also works on kindle fires :)"
60474,"Spotify",2017-08-18,5,"👍Thumbs up   It's great that this app is free! Gives access to pretty much any song you'd want to listen to; with that said I did the free trial with the Premium account and haven't looked back. I use it every day on all my devices and absolutely love it. The ""recommended for you"" and ""discover"" features are also great"

60480,"Spotify",2016-10-14,5,"Always improving, lots of really great features. (Spotify Premium)   This app just keeps getting better and better, I've used it for 6 months now.

I use no other means to listen to music anymore.And to ""artist"" like Taylor Swift who are not on it (every other artist is on it) your s*** isn't worth listening to anyway. We pay for sporting it may not be much but not everyone wants to spend 13.99 on a s*** pop CD when you can spend 9 on sporting and listen to every other amazing artist to grace this earth haha"

60579,"Spotify",2017-03-12,5,"Great choice   Love spotify. Such an amazing selection of genres. We use it at church as well as in my office because of the large selection of Christian artists and instrumental easy listening. Worth the upgrade."

60599,"Spotify",2014-10-05,5,"Spotify Rocks   I only listen to the free music. I do not purchase the upgrade to listen commerical free. The commercials on the free level can be annoying. Spotify works perfectly. It is easy to search for music. Users can create their own playlists. You can listen to or follow a playlist created by someone else. The variety of available music genres and artists is large enough that everyone can find something they like."
60600,"Spotify",2015-11-05,5,"Best subscription music service on the market.   Best subscription service of all time.  I have not liked a music service this much since the real Napster.  I will say that Apple Music has several artists that spotify is missing(Taylor Swift).  However Apple Music does not currently work with android devices.  No android is a deal breaker for me.  Amazon's Prime music service is missing so many artists it is hardly worth mentioning."
60601,"Spotify",2017-04-28,5,"Stimulate Mind and Body   With Spotify, I never hear the same ol' same ol'. I am hearing many songs for the first time by my favorite artist. I love giving my mind some new info in the form of music. Spotify is the best music app!! I listen as I workout and hearing all the new music makes time fly by quickly. Thanks"
60608,"Spotify",2016-12-20,4,"Better with than without   Just signed up a few days ago, so can't honestly give it the 5 stars ... yet.  I do like what I've heard so far.  A very extensive range of music and when picking your likes, it offers more within that category, which is a nice feature.  That said, I haven't found all my tastes in music at this point, but again, I haven't had much time to ""play"" with it.  Definitely enjoy my music life better with than without it!!"
60612,"Spotify",2017-03-19,5,"Best music service out there   Fantastic! And the premium upgrade is actually worth it."
60622,"Spotify",2017-02-04,4,"Good Value and Selections   Excellent music source... free platform commercials ARE mildy annoying.  Good value and a variety of playback methods.  Plenty of mainstream selections, some gaps (assume that's artist prerogative).  fairly comprehensive choices from emerging artists."
60623,"Spotify",2017-07-27,2,"Two Stars   It wouldn't start playing another song, on its own, after a commercial/ad."
60630,"Spotify",2016-01-25,5,"Great music app, simple and great selection!   Spotify has a great selection of music and spoken word works. It's not just an app for listening to music but also has audio books, selections to learn different languages, and stories among other stuff. There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top. When you are in another app and want to go back you have to reopen spotify to do so."

I think that it is a really good app. Also I really like it because you can pick your favorite songs to listen to. Also I really think it is better than pandora cause pandora just picks the songs for you."
60638,"Spotify",2017-01-22,5,"Great!!   This app is great with bunches and bunches of playlists picked by Spotify and some from other people, tons of artists, and not just the ones that are popular right nowor even in this country. Its especially cool because, at least on my version of one of the newer kindles, music from YouTube won't stay playing in another tab or when in an app, but Spotify will."
60639,"Spotify",2016-12-22,5,"Used daily   I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"
60640,"Spotify",2017-08-11,5,"Five Stars   Great!"

60651,"Spotify",2015-09-12,2,"The new update is awful!!   I use to use spotify all the time! The newest update makes it non useable! They're forcing me to use shuffle play, putting on songs I've never even heard of, and taking me off of my playlist! And it keeps shoving the premium upgrade in my face! I sincerely hope that spotify will go back to the way it was."

60657,"Spotify",2017-08-25,3,"Three Stars   Annoying adds but ok for free"
60658,"Spotify",2015-02-22,4,"Good Variety In music, but can't listen offline without paying.   Now, to begin, let me just say that Spotify is nearly as good as Amazon Prime. Nearly. The only downside to it is that you have to pay $9.99 a month if you want to listen to all your favorite tunes offline. Other than that, THIS APP IS AWESOME. The variety of music makes it hard for me to choose what to listen to next, and you can create your own playlists for free."
60659,"Spotify",2016-03-22,4,"great price and service, app acts weird   For the relatively small price of a basic subscription, the options of downloading REALLY great music to your phone to stream no matter where you are and unlimited skips, this service is a steal. However, the unexpected stops while streaming data free can be frustrating, though it is more likely a glitch with the app than the service itself. Apart from that, I love it!"

I use on a daily basis since hearing about it almost a year ago.Pros:LOVE the selection. 90% of what I want is available.Easy to use.Can use on multiple devices, just not at the same time.Cons:Sometimes the connection gets blotchy, understandable as its a net based app.Overall, quite satisfied."
60666,"Spotify",2017-06-24,4,"Four Stars   i wish the songs showed the lyrics like amazon prime does"
60670,"Spotify",2014-12-27,5,"A great app to use every day!   I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."
60679,"Spotify",2017-03-24,4,"great app I love it but...   It has a few bugs to work out. I use this app daily and I love it. The ads are kinda annoying and the 30 minutes with no ads isn't always 30 minutes. Other than that I love it"
60680,"Spotify",2017-05-14,5,"Absolutely Positively Fantastic!!!   I love it! I have found everything I have looked for from the Beatles to the Lemon Pipers to Scott Joplin and John Coltrane and Itzhak Perlman!!!!"
60683,"Spotify",2015-08-04,5,"Best music app ever!   This amazon version is way better than the phone version. On the phone version you can only save your favorite songs then have them shuffled. You can't pick what ever song you want. However, on this app, you can choose whatever song you want, shuffle the music, all with just a few ads every 30 minutes."
60688,"Spotify",2017-05-31,5,"VERY GOOD MUSIC APP   Really good let's you create playlists of your different styles of music you like and have a library and not have to buy every song . When retired very nice.I know"

60692,"Spotify",2015-11-15,5,"Great alternative to using Youtube to listen to music--not to mention it's FREE   It works just as well for Kindle as it does on my laptop and my husband's PS4. I haven't done much aside from saving the songs/albums I like and listening to them. The availability of some of the artists is really nice, compared to other programs that don't have the latest music."
60695,"Spotify",2016-09-05,5,"it's the best   I can use it on my kindle fire like I'm on my own world I can pick the music I want I can share the device if I want to but I may have ads and stuff but I won't get the premium it too much for music if your gonna download it on your phone just don't cause it's not as the best like on as kindle fire 😢😄😄🎶🎶🎶🎵🎴🎵"

60729,"Spotify",2017-08-09,4,"Pretty Great   Great app.  Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. 😁🎵🎶"
60734,"Spotify",2017-03-14,4,"Best. Music. App. Ever!!!!!!!   Spotify is the bomb for music apps because it is gtreat and has basically every song out there!!

60754,"Spotify",2016-09-17,5,"A SpotifyER   I really enjoy Spotify. I like how it recommends certain music just by what I listen to. The podcasts are also another perk. I upgraded just so I could get the full on benefits. The cost is minimal compared to what Spotify offers. It pays for itself!!!!!"
60755,"Spotify",2016-04-03,4,"Use this daily   I wish you could organize your individual playlists in an order you want like you can on desktop.

However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars."

It's super easy to search for any song (even the most obscure), curate amazing playlists, and  save songs you Shazam. The radio feature is way better than Pandora and their existing playlists in the Browse section are pretty decent. Also love that I can follow my friend's playlists."

I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can't play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app."

I first found Spotify when visiting the Billboard website and wanted to hear the songs that were on the charts. I clicked on the Spotify link expecting a sample of the song and got the whole song. It's so good free, I will probably pay for it later."

61190,"Spotify",2017-06-11,5,"Awesome app   I like that it's very easy to find the music I like and then, as it adds more songs, the whole selection is very coherent."
61193,"Spotify",2014-10-10,3,"Could be easier to learn, but definitely a powerful tool   The music selection is *outstanding* but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. I think the screen is cluttered and distracting. I find it difficult to find & learn the tools available. That being said, there are quite a few tools that enable to listen to and enjoying the music you want. It's a great tool, just hard to use."
61195,"Spotify",2017-08-13,5,"Download   This app is great. You can listen to music and build playlists and other things."
61196,"Spotify",2016-09-09,5,"Fantastic app, works way better than the mobile version ...   Fantastic app, works way better than the mobile version of it. With the Spotify app on Android, you are allowed to choose whichever music you want to listen to without having to pay the premium price. Love Spotify? Get the app."
61197,"Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"AMAZING!!!!!!!   You can listen to songs from movies that haven't came in theaters!! This app is so awesome!!!!!! So I recommend it to people that love music or like to listen to music."
61200,"Spotify",2015-02-17,3,"use to be cool   Ok this is a good app but sense the update you need premium to pick any song you want. Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just don't enjoy lessening to the radio that's just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and don't mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app."
61202,"Spotify",2017-05-16,5,"Forget Pandora   Forget iHeartRadio and Pandora and other stations like that! You can find anything and everything you need on Spotify. But they do have ads and want you to pay for Premium. BUT I think you get 7 Days or a Month of Ad free Music but other than that... its pretty dope😂😂😂"
61205,"Spotify",2017-03-27,5,"Superb   Comparable to Rdio, and burns Pandora."

61215,"Spotify",2017-03-15,5,"Excellent app   This app has every song I need its awesome💖💖"
61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I thought it would be...   When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I'm just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".).You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."
61220,"Spotify",2016-05-16,5,"Wonderful App!   Wonderful. I am a premium member so I frequently use this app. Thankfully it is very cooperative with my Kindle Fire HD 8. I see no problem with this app at all. I would highly recommend this app, and I do quiet often, to family, friends and everyone who love listening to music."

61226,"Spotify",2015-11-07,1,"Kindle fires are tablets!!!   I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can't do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the ""tablet"" version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky ""mobile"" version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones. Spotify was great. Please fix this!! I don't understand why kindles are considered different than every other tablet."

61364,"Spotify",2017-01-09,4,"No need to modify Spotify.   I've been enjoying this app. What you can't find probably hasn't been created yet. On the downside of not purchasing the premium package is the fact that you can't hear the specific song you've been dying to listen to all day. Nevertheless, It's worth the time and space on your device."

61395,"Spotify",2015-12-23,5,"great app   I love spotify so much. It works much like pandora in which you can create a radio station of an artist to discover new music. However, you can also find a certain song and save it into 'your music' and play it anytime you want where there's WiFi, for free. Overall, it's a great app and definitely worth the download."
61396,"Spotify",2017-04-04,5,"Good app for listening to old songs.   I mainly downloaded this app to listen to music from the Beatles, the rolling stones, etc.Very good due to the fact that it has the remastered editions, 5/5."

61473,"Spotify",2016-10-21,5,"Enjoy playlists offline   I love Spotify because when I'm on a motorcycle ride with no service I can listen to downloaded playlists. Its worth the monthly fee if you ask me even though I wish it were a little cheaper."

With this app, I have my music with me while I read; just add a cup of coffee and I can say I'm in heaven.The app runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire6, no issues whatsoever. It synchronizes perfectly and sound quality is great (taking into account the Kindle speaker's limitations). If you've used Spotify on your PC/Mac, or Android devices; you'll see no difference in here."

I gave 5 stars because you could use it while playing most games and with premium you could have unlimited skips and won't have to put on shuffle every time you want to listen to music.Add as helpful if you know this joke ......SPOOFY"
61486,"Spotify",2015-01-03,5,"Best Music Streaming App   Of course, this is just my opinion. I've tried lots of different ones in my time. I just can't beat this one, for free, or better yet, totally worth the monthly subscription fee to bypass ads and gain full feature access on mobile.I've only been using the kindle app for spotify for a little over a week now; but no major bugs or glitches yet.I love it."

61624,"Spotify",2016-02-20,5,"Spotify is like, my soulmate. 💑   Worth my money! I installed Spotify on all my devices so I have it everytime. Offline playlist capability is just an awesome feat. Hope more artists would be on Dpotify tho, but I really appreciate that a LOT of indie artists can be found here. My playlists just grew, and my music taste became more diverse! Thank you, Spotify!"
61632,"Spotify",2017-09-19,5,"Very good   Very good. No problems at all."

61636,"Spotify",2017-05-04,1,"Not even a chance   When I downloaded the app and tried to sign up for Spotify it kept on saying that there is an error. I've been trying to sign up for a week now, I'll just have to resort to something else. I'm sure Spotify is great but amazon should improve apps like these BC there are a lot!"
61647,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"I LOVE THIS APP. :)   THIS APP HAS ALL THE MUSIC U WANT AND NEED."
61648,"Spotify",2016-03-31,2,"Premium definitely NOT worth it   Don't waste your money on the Premium!!!  Had it for almost a year...- could NEVER get ""My Songs"" to play correctly (using 2 different laptops and three different Android phones in that time).  Some would play, wome would just not and whenever they would come up it would stop the entire shuffle....and then they would play the next time through....- Making play lists and saving things for Offline use is a pain in the ass!!- The ""artists like this"" or ""songs like this"" function is no better than Pandora (and I've never paid for that premium service""I went to Spotify because Itunes is a pain....but honestly it's no worse...plus had I stayed there, I would actually OWN all the songs I've found on Spotify in the last year!"
61651,"Spotify",2016-03-29,5,"Yep. It works.   This app works just like it does on other platforms. Correctly."
61652,"Spotify",2017-02-12,5,"Great for discovery   Almost all of my favorite music in one place I can take anywhere. Also a powerful tool for discovering new favorites. Unfortunately they've dumbed down the social features and the app can be glitchy. Still deserves 5 stars."
61657,"Spotify",2017-06-20,5,"Five Stars   excellent library and service"
61661,"Spotify",2015-09-10,4,"Good but update ruined it.   This app was Good and you could make your own playlist and fast forward when you like. But now with the new update everything is pretty much the same except now your not able to fast forward and for certain songs all there is are covers. Which stinks because if you were able to fast forward unlimitedly I would rate this a 5 and more."
61662,"Spotify",2014-09-12,5,"My favorite music streaming app!   I love making playlist on my PC and listening to them on my iPhone. I have lists for running, camping, driving, chilling, pretty much anything. Sure there are ads in the free version, but you have to decide for yourself if it is worth ponying up money to skip commercials and listen to music on demand. It is still way fewer breaks than FM radio and I don't mind my playlists shuffled."
61668,"Spotify",2017-01-30,5,"A Better Way to listen to Music.   WHY SPOTIFY? Spotify allow you to create your own Playlist. Listen to unique radio stations, & share music with yourfriends. The steps are easy in creating your own account.'"
61670,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"the new update   This new up date sucks now spotify is like Pandora but you can add all your favorite songs. You have a skip limit unless you pay to be a member, you can't have songs on repeat unless your a member, and you can pick the songs you want to play u must use shuffle unless you are a member. Spotify change back other wise more people might go to Pandora."
61672,"Spotify",2015-08-10,5,"Perfect   This app is the best to listen to your music. Pandora isn't good if you don't have an email. This is the best app you can get to listen to your music when you want. I love it. I can now listen to my favorite band whenever I want. This is the best thing you can ever get!"
61677,"Spotify",2014-08-14,5,"The Best Music Service (So Far)   Gotta love the quality of the streamed music, the vast library and the freedom to choose and listen to tracks, albums, lists or ""radio"".Finding one's way around the various menus as well as the reliability of the search function might be improved but no major complaints overall.I appreciate all of the various music services but Spotify has quickly become our favorite of the bunch."
61681,"Spotify",2017-02-14,3,"Eh?   It works well but sometimes the app bugs out but after that you gotta watch another ad, some ads are like 1 minute and 30 seconds long for some reason also"
61684,"Spotify",2014-10-26,5,"Best music app you could get   I highly recommend this app. You can like all the songs you like from stations and put them all into one playlist and then shuffle all the songs! Unlike Jango and Pandora. This app is amazing and there is no other better music app. Get this app if you like music ! ^.^"
61686,"Spotify",2016-01-10,5,"Wow!!   This is is amazing for all types of people.... if your into gospel, pop, r&b, rap, hip pop, country, calm, energetic, techno, etc. whatever genre it is...it's there!! I fall asleep to all of my favorite music, artists, or genres....overall it's amazing!! Also, for premium it's $0.99 for 3 MONTHS!!!!"

61690,"Spotify",2017-05-25,4,"PERFECT , BUT SOME MODIFICATIONS WOULD BE GREAT   I like the app and the music is free. But sometimes the freezes. But other then that specify is the perfect app to download and get great and free music. So it is a great app."
61691,"Spotify",2015-08-19,5,"Awesome   Normally, with this kind of app you can't put custom songs into one playlist like iheartradio or pandora, so since this app allows you to do that along with what iheartradio and pandora (not mentioning a few others), it is definitely the best music app to have."
61698,"Spotify",2015-09-13,5,"titenic song ON HERE OMG COULD OF CALLED THIS GAME FLYING EGGPLANT   omg jontron ft shmoyoho titenic is on here amazing along with dagames fnaf songs and living tombstone's songs, perfect app for anyone who likes any one of thoses,AND MUCH MORE,my final thoughts, YOU COULD CALL THIS APP 10/10 AND NOONE WILL ARGUE WITH YOU,cant forget the flying eggplant"

61723,"Spotify",2016-02-05,5,"why you should get Spotify   Spotify is a wonderful app I like it very much! It is easy to find your favorite music and artists + more. Apps like Pandora are hard for me to use because you can't find the features easily. I highly suggest spotify for a music loving person like you!! 😄😄😄😄🍉🌼🍇🍍🌈🌸🍓🍁🌷"
61726,"Spotify",2017-09-07,3,"Good app, but not perfect   Still missing some pretty popular music, gets very glitchy when using with multiple devices.Songs that I downloaded are suddenly not downloaded. My library fluctuates if I'm on wi-fi, songs that I removed keep coming back into my library, not very user friendly."
61728,"Spotify",2017-07-22,5,"Great music app   I really enjoy Spotify. Tons of music, playlists created for you based on your interests, new music suggestions weekly. Two thumbs up!"
61729,"Spotify",2016-03-24,3,"Stop Auto downloading   Ever since the new update my spotlight has been downloading every song I have saved. Which would be fine but it's using up all my storage. I've tried everything I can to combat this problem but it keeps happening. I loved the app before but now it's aggravating me."
61730,"Spotify",2017-08-24,2,"Too many ads, too many lies.   As per music ratio is way too much. It says thirty minutes of free music, but I've timed it several times. If I've ever gotten twenty minutes I'd be surprised."
61735,"Spotify",2015-09-23,3,"New update sucks for free users.   Loved the app up until it's recent update. Now I have to shuffle through my 100 plus song playlists to listen to the one I want. Or if you want to listen to the charts and see a new song you have to go through it all to listen to the newest one. Love the app but definitely needs to go back to select a song and listen!"
61740,"Spotify",2014-12-20,5,"Very Good App!   This is a good app. I  think the only fall back is not being able to skip songs as many times as I want but other than that it's a great app."
61741,"Spotify",2017-07-18,4,"Wonderful!   Love the discover weekly playlist!  Bring up songs I'd totally forgotten about!  99% of the time I find the exact song I am looking for.  Keep up the good work!"
61742,"Spotify",2017-07-26,5,"Great app for 🎶   This is the best music app! Almost all songs are on here (a rare few are not) Great for work or sleep. Only thing is how many adds there are when you do not have a premium account. (However I have premium so it might of changed) I would totally recommend this app."
61746,"Spotify",2017-08-09,5,"Spot on with spotify   This is such a good deal I feel guilty like I'm stealing the music and it ROCKS !"
61750,"Spotify",2016-09-04,5,"Does music things   App is only worth it with premium, if you have free you can only shuffle albums. But 10 dollars a month (5 if you're a student) is worth it for anyone who obsessively listens to music. Has pretty much everything you'd ever want."
61753,"Spotify",2017-06-17,5,"The Pandora killer   Because of Spotify, I will never use Pandora again. Spotify is great, because it allows you to build your own playlist(s) and you're not forced to listen to songs that really don't suit your mood. I have Spotify on all of my devices."
61757,"Spotify",2015-02-17,4,"Great app!   Love creating my music library with Spotify! There's  a fantastic selection to choose from. Would definitely recommend to any music lover."

61766,"Spotify",2014-10-15,5,"Plz Get   Plz get this it is great if you love music. Even if you don't like most songs and you just like a few songs thats ok because Spotify has about every song you can think of.My whole family loves Spotify and listens to it all the time in the car at the house and at other people's houses if you have the acount that cost money."

61788,"Spotify",2015-06-30,3,"Only one user at a time, unless you pony up another 5 bucks a month   I enjoy spotify.  I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month.  That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time.  I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."
61790,"Spotify",2016-07-03,5,"Spotify the Great   Spotify is the legit best Music app in the business because I have had no problems with this program what so ever and I listen to my music everyday! So its great the app is here !!!"

61807,"Spotify",2015-09-17,1,"really spotify?   I was amazed with spotify at first, i could skip all the songs i eanted and i could play whatever song i wanted even without permium.Then i got the update... i am highly frustrated with the new update you can only skip a few songs and cant play the songs you want. Spotify WAS better than pandora but not anymore."
61808,"Spotify",2016-08-28,5,"Amazing!   This app is amazing! I can listen to countless songs that I really like. Its similar to Pandora except you actually choose the song you listen too. I love it!"
61816,"Spotify",2015-01-05,5,"Best music app out there!   Wish I could have had this year's ago. I love the discover feature that suggest new albums. Better selection than other apps, and more hard to find artists than I could have ever imagined in an app. Never crashes, and uses very little data."
61817,"Spotify",2017-09-01,5,"Amazing app   All of my favorite music whenever wherever it awesome I definitely recommend this app"
61818,"Spotify",2015-09-13,3,"don't update   I updated Spotify a few days ago, and now you have limited skips. When I first got this app I liked it because it wasn't like any other music app. You could choose and skip any song you wanted but if you update it takes that away. I hope it turns back to normal soon."
61820,"Spotify",2014-08-19,5,"All the Music you would want - and its free !   I love all kinds of music and to be able to stream anything you like is just incredible.  Especially as it comes free.Just search for your favourite track and download it, to play anytime and anywhere you like.  Classical, modern, whole albums.  It's all there, making CD' s a thing of the past."
61825,"Spotify",2015-04-02,5,"I love spotify!   It has all of the music I love plus you can find just about anything just by searching. Falling to sleep to the nature sounds or thunder and rain has made me sleep much better. Waking up to my favorite tunes or discovering new favorites in the morning before work is priceless. Thank you Spotify!"
61832,"Spotify",2017-07-28,1,"Annoying   Spotify has tons of great music but when you go to different apps while listening to a song it stops playing and you have to go back to the app. Also those ads that are supposed to give 30 minutes of add free music play almost after every song you listen to. I hate to say it but I might go back to SoundCloud"
61836,"Spotify",2014-11-04,5,"Best music App hands down   Not only does it have all the music you'd ever want to hear... it has tons of music you've never even heard of. This is the best music application I've ever used. Pandora is nice but you have little choice in what song you get to hear, Spotify gives you the power to choose."
61838,"Spotify",2016-06-16,4,"Good except for one thing   i like the app i jus wish they would put something on there to turn of the shuffle play even if u dont hav the premium version"

61855,"Spotify",2016-04-04,4,"you enjoy many options for streaming quality and you are allowed ...   It's okay for listening to music. The music quality isn't particularly outstanding unless you purchase Spotify Premium, in which case, you enjoy many options for streaming quality and you are allowed unlimited skips, which is a big plus."
61859,"Spotify",2016-04-23,4,"Don't think about it, just get it!   I love that I can save all music and I can hear it off-line if needed. It's saves me a lot of data and battery even when I have it on airplane mode. I have so many music saved and it doesn't affect my phone at all. I love this app"

62079,"Spotify",2015-11-14,1,"Not for Me   Only took 2 songs before I uninstalled it. Was looking for a station to create a romantic mood. Picked the country music love song station. After two songs a really annoying commercial for a hip hop station came on. A really long commercial at that. Really defeats the purpose for selecting that station."
62081,"Spotify",2017-08-01,5,"Necessity.   Luuuvvvvv; a necessity for me."

62112,"Spotify",2017-09-30,4,"Four Stars   For free it is very good."
62114,"Spotify",2014-08-03,3,"I would have given it four stars   I purchsed the app because its great and so i could use it on my smart tv. But I can not control the Tv app from another device as I can with youtube and others. Also, when I search a track the results will show playlists that the track appears in. Not on the Tv app though! Then on top of that, there is no radio option. Because I use the Tv app often these little features are huge."
62115,"Spotify",2015-01-10,3,"I use Spotify onmy laptop and love it. This app limits you to playlists   I use Spotify onmy laptop and love it. This app limits you to playlists. You can't listen to the song you want to hear without slogging through the other songs on the list."

62146,"Spotify",2016-03-07,5,"Spotify   Excellent  and easy to use."
62156,"Spotify",2015-08-28,3,"It's not terrible   Suffers in comparison to Apple music, especially pricing. Commercials on the free app are painful. Not impressed with search algorithm. Curated playlists are kinda meh compared to Songsta. Not the cleanest UI, controls should be clearly labelled, but then all music apps have serious UX issues for new users. No one should have to guess how an app as widely downloaded as this works."
62158,"Spotify",2017-07-01,3,"Music is life   Yes it is 💋❤️"
62168,"Spotify",2015-07-03,4,"Four Stars   I like the App, but it's not compatible with the Kindle Fire! Why not!!!?"

62218,"Spotify",2015-11-21,1,"One Star   doesnt deserve one star. It doesn't work."
62228,"Spotify",2017-08-02,1,"That god-foresaken Gap ad   The app is all fine but when the Gap advertisement comes on, it doesn't play and I get stuck on that screen so I have to constantly force close the app. But that doesn't necessarily fix the problem because when I run the app again I have to listen to an ad to play music and more often than not it's that god foresaken Gap ad. I don't know if it's just me with the problem but honestly it's too much of a hassle just to play some music."
62232,"Spotify",2014-10-25,4,"Four Stars   Great app - adverts bit of a pain but can't complain when you're getting music for nothing."
62235,"Spotify",2015-03-23,5,"Brilliant.   Spotify is amazing, I listen while I surf or work on my laptop"
62238,"Spotify",2017-07-31,4,"Well its not Pandora   Like how you can sync this with Touchtunes should you find yourself in a bar........(I'm usually in one since I work security).........but as long as the bar has Wifi then by all means use it."
62248,"Spotify",2015-12-26,3,"Awesome!...But there's a catch.   Good app! I can listen to all my favorite songs and put them in  playlists! The catch: your music is stuck in shuffle mode and you can't take it off unless you have premium, then it works great! Also, sometimes you can't preview the song you want because it is stuck in shuffle."
62256,"Spotify",2016-02-15,4,"like it but...   This app is great but, you can't play any song u want u have to go on shuffle and I HATE it so to me I think it's four stars and it's like Pandora but u have single songs and playlist but some parts you need to pay but if you need a GOOD song app get Iheart radio."
62257,"Spotify",2017-08-13,4,"Love it   If only it was 100% free, but still AMAZING"
