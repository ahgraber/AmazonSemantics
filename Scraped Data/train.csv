23,"Amazon",2016-12-02,5,"BETTER THAN ITUNES! AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"
27,"Amazon",2017-09-04,5,"Five Stars Excellent"

48,"Amazon",2017-03-02,5,"Its Free Its Free"
50,"Amazon",2015-04-15,5,"I was not sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I do not have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movie I started out by taking advantage of the prime 30 day free trial. I was not sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I do not have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I do not have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV.Thanks again.Love Amazon and Prime Amazon.Keep up the good work"
51,"Amazon",2017-04-06,4,"Good all around source for music. Pretty good availability. Not all choices available free musicare the original musicians or versions of particular songs ,you probably can purchase them . On my laptop the Playlist is a little hard to edit ."
55,"Amazon",2016-06-03,5,"I love Amazon Music! My go to when I drive. I love the music selection. I was also happily surprised when I got a message last week that the new Bob Dylan was out. I promptly downloaded it. I truly dig the stations and suggested music."
56,"Amazon",2016-11-22,4,"How cool is that YOu can think of a lot of songs and then they are there for almost free Prime cost. How cool is that, no CD's no tapes , no records just right there. Not all music shows up , but the majority of the time i find what i am looking for. The search could be more easier but perhaps it is my searching technique winking"
57,"Amazon",2016-11-15,4,"Works for me! Works well on my smart phone. Not comparing it to itunes or any other provider As a stand alone product, I use it with Audio CDs purchased and I can download with prime in 5 seconds. I use it daily no measure of sound quality, etc.Simply works for me. Use phone, open Amazon player, hear my music. Grateful!"
59,"Amazon",2017-06-03,5,"Five Stars it is so nice!"

75,"Amazon",2017-09-01,5,"Five Stars Love it!!!! Move over pandora"
81,"Amazon",2017-05-03,5,"Five Stars love"
82,"Amazon",2015-09-27,5,"Come for the shipping, stay for the free music and movies! AZ keeps adding more reasons to use Prime. This is one of them. Lots of music to hear for free on a variety of devices. Come for the shipping, stay for the music and movies!"
85,"Amazon",2017-06-11,5,"Five Stars Nice"
88,"Amazon",2017-03-13,5,"Five Stars great"
89,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"great service all kinds of music great service all kinds of music. would be great if it had a voice recognition to search for music while you drive"
92,"Amazon",2016-04-07,5,"Works great now. It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless."
97,"Amazon",2015-02-20,1,"Not working on my device I have tried over and over again to get this app to open on my phone. I keep getting an Account Error Exception number 45 . I have reported the problem and get no reply from Amazon customer service."
101,"Amazon",2016-11-06,5,"Five Stars Excellent product as advertized"
105,"Amazon",2014-06-15,3,"Lacking content, but free Get free music from a service that you already pay for. How can you not like it!! The selection is a little scarce, but it is new, so I am sure the selection will increase in time. Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors instead of launching additional services. Just seems a little backwards to me, but I will not complain about something free!!"
106,"Amazon",2014-07-03,1,"I know you are not listening, BUT For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with. Very dissapointed. Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire products. Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever. You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them. You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."
107,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Not happy with Android app I do not know what the core problem is, but I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 AT and T and I have another app that can track things like when apps restart multiple times, consuming resources like RAM memory, response time, and temperature, and for whatever reason, this and all the other Amazon apps have periods where they will restart anywhere from 5 to 47 times in a 5 minute period. Amazon, you gotta fix this, it is not right to be slowing down a competitor's product."
108,"Amazon",2017-03-15,3,"Three Stars Liked it better before changes."
109,"Amazon",2017-03-03,5,"It is great! I adore this app. It is great !"
111,"Amazon",2017-08-31,5,"Five Stars Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. 5 stars!"
122,"Amazon",2015-04-23,4,"I like it, wish it had more Hawaiian - - Jawaiian flare I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music, I like it for the most part - there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free. I took one star away because, like I said before - - it is only POPULAR music. I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music. Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music, but I am more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio."
123,"Amazon",2016-01-29,5,"no problem I do not understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma happy"
127,"Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"Music to my ears! I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!"
133,"Amazon",2015-08-09,5,"Five Stars I just love Amazon Music with Prime Music. can not wait to see what the future holds."
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix Great its part of Prime"
135,"Amazon",2015-04-30,3,"COULD be a 5 star... I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I do not get that. since then, it is happening more and more frequently. Whether I am home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I am disappointed I had to go back to Pandora."
136,"Amazon",2016-06-18,2,"Nothing to write home about. Its a decent bonus, but its no replacement for anybof my other music apps. The 1st 3 songs I tried to find werent in the collection, and the app does not play well withy android platform. I deleted it."
144,"Amazon",2014-08-12,1,"Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts. We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device yes, we know only 1 device at time. However, the shuffle does not really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts."
147,"Amazon",2016-10-05,5,"A lot of good music This even beats itunes! You can get an artist or song with their search!"
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars Love it"
157,"Amazon",2016-04-13,1,"The Worst Amazon Product Ever If I could give this app negative stars, I would.I have been a longtime Amazon customer since the '90's. When the Amazon MP3 app came out, it was great. There were free daily MP3's, and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish, but then you would get a new Android phone and it would be okay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music, and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps Shopping and Kindle. It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again, and it worked for maybe a month, before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non-existent--they will only talk to you on the phone, and then they will tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is ridiculous.I recently tried the app again, and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re-login, but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me--it gives me a network error, so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version, and guess what, it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can not access my cloud library or Prime Music.So, I give up Amazon. I have bought a ton of crap from you, and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone, but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great, Music works great on my iPad and Kindle Fire and Fire TV, so I do not know what your problem is."
163,"Amazon",2017-09-30,4,"Four Stars good music"
167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right it is an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle, echo, music, prime, etc. they can not seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
170,"Amazon",2017-09-06,5,"😊 Selection is good for the type of music i preferEasy to search and download"
173,"Amazon",2016-06-14,4,"Four Stars good"
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five Stars Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
175,"Amazon",2015-04-19,2,"Amazon Music with Prime Music Very obtuse, difficult to navigate and select genre which are very limited. I had an even harder time with it on my phone. It also says you can download music if you are a Prime member but I haven't figured out how to do it without paying for the songs. If it is possible that is fine but it apparently is not user friendly."
179,"Amazon",2016-08-21,5,"Love this perk with prime! I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.I love all the chanel's offered."
180,"Amazon",2014-07-29,3,"No artist data When I use with Bluetooth in car the displayed data is missing artist. I can see track and album but artist data missing. This only happens with Amazon music. Google, songza, milk, Pandora, Spotify all display complete data"
181,"Amazon",2016-02-16,3,"It plays and allows you to choose most songs. The 500 song limit is cheesy, the radom function is not! Program runs extremely slow when adding songs to playlist"
186,"Amazon",2015-09-26,1,"IT KEEPS CRASHING... AND CRASHING... AND OOPS... CRASHED LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD INTO A FARMERS MARKET! I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crashes every few minutes. I have used it in the past with no issues but with this HTC one M8 it crashes and then wants me to send a report. Every time this happens it shuts does whatever other program i am using. GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!YES I have tried updating does not helpYES I have tried to install/re-install its factory so there is no total uninstall"
199,"Amazon",2017-01-19,5,"Five Stars it is the best one there is!"
205,"Amazon",2014-07-21,4,"Great, but want more access! I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can not access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device."
207,"Amazon",2017-10-07,5,"My music I love it!"
210,"Amazon",2014-08-18,3,"Spotify is still a better deal. I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce. Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they Amazon still want you to purchase music. If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you will like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead. Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you are going to run into problems. Seriously, at dollar 10 dollars a month dollar 5 for students first time Spotify is a far superior product."
211,"Amazon",2016-11-09,5,"Five Stars Love this app. It has so many features."
212,"Amazon",2016-12-29,1,"Latest update sucks! It was nice having a large selection of free music with my Prime membership, but latest update seems to have taken a lot of that away. As if the Prime membership fee is not enough, you now want me to pay a subscription to listen to music that was once inluded with Prime! Guess you need to be more like the competitors and nickle and dime your customers at every turn!"
215,"Amazon",2016-11-07,2,"Poor upgrade page does not open, see dog pic,s - not as easy as the first version a couple of years ago - makes want to go back to pandora or google tunes -"
216,"Amazon",2017-09-05,5,"My best friend Love the selection of music. Amazon Music is my best friend. it is with me where ever I go."
217,"Amazon",2014-12-14,5,"I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders ... I usually like to control my music and have copies in folders etc, but Amazon Music is such a complete system, when you have prime, I have been moving to it. Thanks Amazon."
218,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Amazon is Great! Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I do not have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of 250 songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
223,"Amazon",2017-07-19,5,"Why do not you have this? If your a prime member, there is no reason not to use music. No interruptions, all kinds of choices. A must!"
226,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"good quality. Desktop app is nice Lot of music, good quality. Desktop app is nice. But can not cast to chrome cast, and not as user friendly when it comes to offline stuff like Spotify."
229,"Amazon",2015-05-27,1,"Losses track of library I use this to run with. Only problem is everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out, sign back in, and redownload the songs in my playlist. Then as soon as I disconnect from WiFi it loses my songs again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very updating bug."
234,"Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"This app sucks This app sucks. I read there is not a charge it is free. Ya right until you try to download a song. I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance. it is not like I am trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!! Gee wiz"
236,"Amazon",2014-12-27,5,"Buy An Amazon Prime Membership!! NOW!! If you do not see an Amazon Prime Membership paying off, just for the free two day shipping alone, then Do It For The Music!! You will Never have a lack of music that you love, no matter what style, genre, or artist. it is All Here!! And, that is not even mentioning what is available if you have Amazon Fire TV Boxes, or Amazon Fire TV Stick!! At dollar 99.00 per year, that comes out to dollar 8.25 per month!! You can finally say Goodbye to Cable TV, Satellite TV, etc........FOREVER!!! I Did!!"
240,"Amazon",2015-01-02,1,"Completely Useless - Randomly stops stream. Way better options to stream music. The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used. It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music. This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device. It even stops on my Kindle. You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope. I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping. If I was not a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services."
249,"Amazon",2015-07-29,5,"I LOVE BEING AN AMAZON PRIME MEMBER! When I first started this membership, I was skeptical with the service. 2 day delivery, free prime music, free prime movies. But boy was I blown away! My wife and I enjoy the Fast and Speedy delivery! When they say Guaranteed in 2 days THEY MEAN IT! The free prime music and movies are better than what I bargained for and for what I paid with that 1 time payment, you will see you get Soo much more! I am just regular guy from NY that found this membership to be a great deal!"
255,"Amazon",2017-03-13,3,"Needs easier connection to Samsung Multiroom. Nice to have on the phone, but it does not work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I did not find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home."
260,"Amazon",2017-07-23,4,"Four Stars like it"
263,"Amazon",2016-06-08,5,"great selction really great selection and gteat to have all in 1 place."
264,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"Would be great if it worked... On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
271,"Amazon",2017-09-05,5,"awesome awesome music"
273,"Amazon",2016-06-06,5,"Great deal - I already had Prime for free shipping, now I have free music too No commercials - good user interface. The content is not as broad as Spotify but I found lots of music I like. Also, Jason Aldean is on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do ... I have Rhapsody now, so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is, rhapsody is easier and I do not have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/foodway to expensive!/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
283,"Amazon",2015-07-05,2,"Wide variety of music. Its just ridiculous they want ... Wide variety of music. Its just ridiculous they want dollar 99 up front just to tie you to a contract on something you probably will not use daily."
285,"Amazon",2017-08-23,4,"Four Stars Good app lots of music"
286,"Amazon",2016-01-02,5,"I love this app. This app has worked perfectly for me since I installed it. I can download music and also stream from my library with no problems."
289,"Amazon",2015-05-18,4,"LOVE this app As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora my previous favorite any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I have made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."
290,"Amazon",2017-05-29,1,"NoWay Why should I have to pay for it when I am already a prime member? No thanks! !!!!"
291,"Amazon",2016-03-01,1,"CANCELLED Could not make this App work on my device, canceled the order."
294,"Amazon",2016-09-29,4,"I love having this ap to listen to full albums I love having this ap to listen to full albums!it is a pain if it will not load sometimes, but a lot of that is just Internet connection."
295,"Amazon",2015-01-05,5,"Got to have Amazon Music OMG!!! The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used."
296,"Amazon",2015-10-07,1,"USA issued Credit Card.... seriously? Music Collection under prime could be better, nevertheless i am happy with it because i do not need my spotify subscription--edit--After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i do not have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."
297,"Amazon",2016-06-14,5,"Beats Pandora!!! Beats Pandora! You can go back and listen to a song again, skip unlimited, no commercials/advertisements, and it does not stop playing with are you still listening?"
298,"Amazon",2016-07-27,5,"Good deal. Build your own list Good deal. Build your own list."
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and ... I have yet to figure out what is free and what is not. Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60 songs bought? Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply. I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges. I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
301,"Amazon",2016-12-18,5,"Love Great app! I cannot live without my amazon music. You can shop, create play lists and will show up as apart of your regular music app that is on your phone. Keep in mind you can do most of this but I do have prime which may be allowing me to do all of these things."
304,"Amazon",2016-04-03,1,"One Star Really? How about flip a switch And let this run on my Shield Tablet."
312,"Amazon",2017-07-22,4,"Four Stars nice"
318,"Amazon",2016-10-28,5,"Music for everyone😁! I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot.I absolutely love the fact that it is commercial free.I am overall happy with it.Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear."
322,"Amazon",2017-01-21,5,"Five Stars Great job"
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime! This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music my play list and stations or other playlists. Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would have given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
330,"Amazon",2017-03-15,5,"Five Stars k"
331,"Amazon",2016-09-29,3,"Good but just top pop It is a good addition to prime but the music is still just top pop of what they want you to hear. I would like more off beat choices"
332,"Amazon",2017-04-05,4,"Only USA Huge number of songs and type of music"
337,"Amazon",2017-02-11,5,"Does what is expected... Does what is expected..."
354,"Amazon",2017-04-26,5,"super super happy with Amazon Music. super super happy with Amazon Music."
355,"Amazon",2014-07-09,2,"Limited Listening Options I am very unhappy with the shift from Cloud Player t Amazon Music. In most corporate setting employees are not given the choice of browsers they use or what programs they may install, which in this case means I can no longer listen to my purchased music at work. The compatibility with only the latest IE browsers or installing non-IE browsers in an imposibility. I understand Amazon is in the money-making business but some of the recent changes make me think customer service is no longera priority."
356,"Amazon",2017-06-26,5,"The best music app out there! Greatest app! All your favorite songs, no adds, unlimited skips and replays. does not ask you if you are still listening. Just another awesome addition to your Amazon Prime account"
363,"Amazon",2016-04-22,4,"A nice addition to my Prime membership A nice addition to my Prime membership. I think overall it is a nice music service but the lack of tracks available has me still using Spotify for most of my music streaming. All in all I am pleased, its not like I am paying more for it anyways. For something that I get with my membership its more than I would expect."
364,"Amazon",2016-06-07,5,"Five Stars ALMOST better than Spotify winking"
365,"Amazon",2017-10-14,5,"Five Stars I love Amazon music period. On any device it is awesome."
368,"Amazon",2016-09-13,5,"Five Stars 😊"
371,"Amazon",2013-11-06,1,"Disappointed. does not work on my HTC Rezound. can not say for other phones. I have HTC Rezound, and I do not know why, but this app does not work. I have updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth with the buttons between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second I can see the album art, but there is no way to play it. My music just does not show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I."

399,"Amazon",2015-05-03,4,"Gotta do some searching to get it for BB. I tried to download to my BB via amazon apps and amazon mobile. No luck so, had to use a mirror to download.The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash. Otherwise, the sound quality at the highest level in a compatible wi-fi environment is fantastic, and it is better than having to listen to pandora or spotify with their commercials."
401,"Amazon",2014-08-29,2,"Prime Music Service Review Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for offline listening. It seems to me that having more songs streamed to Prime Members would not cost Amazon all that much more money, especially since most of them are VERY old songs!!! Also, a few more of the newer recordings, or, compilation albums would be nice."
403,"Amazon",2017-02-28,1,"Junk As few features they have for yhis app you might think they would work, unfortunately often they do not. Feels like this app is just a marketing ploy to make people think they are getting more from Amazon prime then they will."

408,"Amazon",2015-08-14,2,"I *LOVE*Amazon Prime Music, BUT... I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music APM I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE, space-consuming app! Let me elaborate: I have had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I do not download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as 500 and 47 and 200, etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the and number 34;Recommended for you and number 34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images and data, there is apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary space-destroying! data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images and data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96GIGABYTES! -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS and PLAYS MUSIC and number 60;need and number 62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed, I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!, I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"
418,"Amazon",2011-08-27,5,"best mp3 player, and if it could play drm files it would be perfect Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. it is easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety even though it is already large in this genre. another problem I have which is really more to do with Apple with it is that it can not play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."

454,"Amazon",2016-04-25,5,"I rarely use Prime Video, but Prime Music was an unexpected surprise! I have had Prime since it was first offered years ago, simply because it seems I order everything from Amazon and, well, like to receive things as quickly as possible. I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved! No, I do not work for Amazon! Just an honest and frankly unexpected appraisal."
455,"Amazon",2014-04-07,1,"does not import everything over very accurately Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and does not import all types of audio files.Also find it a little frustrating to navigate through.The idea is great, but I feel I have wasted my £21.00 yearly subscription and could have spent it better on another product."

I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into seriously, Bezos, what is up with the lack of privacy? that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. it is cumbersome to navigate the search feature you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you are looking for. The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations 100's and as far as I am able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I am not sure why there is not a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!"

I have several different categories rock, classical, country, alternative, comedy, Halloween sounds for trick or treaters, Christmas music for sitting around the house, etc. and have all of it totally organized in its own category. If I am in the mood for country, I will just scroll to country, hit shuffle all and hit play and all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order.

Additionally, songs such as Amor Eterno listing Juan Gabriel as the singer yet when I play it, it is not Juan Gabriel singing, and there are numerous amounts of songs like that. .An OLDIES station that plays a bunch of basically UNKNOWN songs. When building a play list, we are allowed to add duplicate songs without a warning. Same applies when suggested songs are listed with an option to ADD to my music when in fact the song is already in my music. I thought Prime Music would be replacing my Pandora, not any time soon.

512,"Amazon",2013-12-23,5,"Very good product Easier than i-tunes or notoriously confusing Winamp or MS medial player libraries. However, the quality of cataloging the songs or albums solely depends on quality of mp3 ID tags. Sometimes, the songs from the compilation albums may be split over several albums, and that is only because the ID tags associate the file with particular album. If you are to load your own library of albums anything can happen. However, the Mp3s downloaded from Amazon, whether the albums or compilations, require no action in fixing ID tags."

There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collections. Instead, look at Google Music or Audiogalaxy the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day. Both have android clients with usable, albiet slow interfaces for large collections."

You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon.

This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I do not want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it did not conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.Yep, I am divorcing you.

The 2 day shipping, amazon video, and music. it is a no brainer for me. Amazon is my GO TO spot for all my needs"
704,"Amazon",2015-07-23,5,"Better than iTunes - Haven't tried the Apple music, but this is great! Wow! What a great way to discover new music, create your own playlist or listen to one of theirs. Those songs that are Prime Eligible free you can also download to your device. do not know if I will go back to iTunes again."
709,"Amazon",2016-01-19,5,"Incredible Value...it is Amazong!? For a little more than the monthly cost of Pandora One you get to pick your songs and artists with unlimited skips, Amazon Video...and 2-day shipping on Prime purchases!"

722,"Amazon",2014-06-21,1,"latest update makes it impossible for usw in car the latest update last week or so destroyed my use of this app in the car.in the now playing screen, you used to ge able to swipe to go to next song, previous song.this latest update has that functionality, but when you swipe it pops up a context menu. WTF.then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.super lousy bug. that alone is causing me to look for another player."

729,"Amazon",2015-12-19,2,"Constant buffering Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason. No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies.

And when I search my favorite band there that are. Best music app around"
740,"Amazon",2016-03-29,5,"My favorite music service The service is fantastic. I really love the music selection and the ability to play what I want, when I want. The mobile app can be a bit flaky from time-to-time, but that could be due more to my phone than the app itself. This has replaced Pandora on all of my devices."

749,"Amazon",2015-08-01,4,"nice Great but wish I could figure out how to play the different genres as a shuffle, since I like to listen to a mix of music. If I could figure out how to play Modern County, Top Hip Hop and Latin Pop would give 5stars."

773,"Amazon",2014-01-07,4,"Much Better UPDATE:I got a new Samsung S3 and it seems to work really well on this phone, not sure if it was an update to the app or if it just works better on my new phone but the app did not work before on my Evo 3DI do not know what they have done to it, but now on my htc evo 3d 4g the widget will not go on the screen, even if the home screen is empty it says there is not enough space. The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you do not make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently, now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can not even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I would at least raise it back to like 4 stars."

785,"Amazon",2016-03-05,5,"Five Stars LOVE IT"
790,"Amazon",2016-11-21,1,"This is a terrible app, and it is doing all it can to get worse!!! This used to be a serviceable option for those of us not in iPhones, but now with their new streaming music service Amazon seems to be rapidly abandoning the non-streaming portion part of their music service. they are making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I do not use it. Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can not even get your music from it anymore."

812,"Amazon",2015-12-02,3,"Another Music Steaming App; different pros and cons The mobile app is pretty good. The site and the desktop app ui needs some work; very beta feeling. Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool. Looks like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything. I currently use 5 now..."

This is great, my only question is why is every-time I Iisten there is a loud squelch in the speakers about 30 - 60 seconds into the first song?

821,"Amazon",2016-04-27,1,"Poor app I was so excited to find this app so i could enjoy my prime music on the go but sadly it sucks. Yes i can download music on the go but it doesnt help when the music wont play or starts buffering and never recovers. I sure hope it will be better in the future"

Even has a setting so the only items you will see are FREE with prime. This app is perfect.Thank you, Amazon."
829,"Amazon",2015-02-21,1,"Worst App Ever - Makes Me Want To Leave My Amazon Music Account Behind. The app I hate the most. Terrible user interface. Would not let me play music I downloaded to my phone from Amazon Music without signing in with my e-mail address and password. HUH?! This was finally fixed in an update, but still horrible, tiny menus that can not be read at a slight distance I.E. used in a car and are completely un-intuitive. The app will ALWAYS try to play Prime Music streaming instead of music on your phone. Hello wasted data dollar dollar dollar . Some artists/songs that I purchased do not show up in different views title/genre/artist/album. The original app was fine, when Prime Music was added they ruined it."
830,"Amazon",2014-06-12,3,"app needs work The prime music service is great. However the app needs improvements. it is clunky, many links into deeper pages are text only when a button would be nicer. You cannot add items to your library without tapping them first, where a long press should be able to give that option."

854,"Amazon",2016-12-29,5,"I am having SO much fun with this! Intuitive, with a wide array of music I love. This gives me the chance to listen to songs I haven't heard in years by artists who had sadly slipped my mind. I love it. What else is there to say?"

861,"Amazon",2015-05-12,4,"Good! One considerable bug, could use a few features. I have really enjoyed exploring new music and being able to download it to my device, I do not think it has the volume button skip capability even the screen is off that I enjoy as part of Google Play, it also will just turn off occasionally forcing me to reopen the app which is annoying and is dangerous/should not be done when driving. Note 4"

889,"Amazon",2015-06-23,2,"I love music. I had this app on an android ... 2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I have tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I am one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I am lucky the music will start up again with no interaction like its buffering and this is not me streaming. I playing the music I downloaded . I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."
895,"Amazon",2016-03-29,3,"Love the app when it works Love the app when it works, as it freezes playing my prime music, and says it has downloaded music when it has not, which are a skosh disturbing."
898,"Amazon",2013-02-01,5,"Again Amazon gives you space saving technology Not sure if you need the cloud, then you get this, as that is the way I did it. But the MP3 uploader works fine. It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded. And I am sure they covered every file type know. Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech. it is ease of operation is quite simple. If you want things more complicated here, look elsewhere. it is perfect for everyone from 8 to 80. Excellent product."

914,"Amazon",2015-11-21,1,"Dissapointing sound quality I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording.

955,"Amazon",2014-09-26,4,"Great App! Just Bring The Equalizer To The Front. I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it is one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."
958,"Amazon",2013-07-24,4,"Incredibly Convenient Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you are like me, you probably have because you do not want to have to click ok every time you open the app."
962,"Amazon",2014-06-18,5,"More to love about Amazon. Awesome new feature for Prime customers. Plenty of great songs to engage the ears. This truly is a wonderful new and unexpected treat."
963,"Amazon",2012-12-11,4,"Great App!! I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes."

I know now not to do this..his phone was able to access more bird calls then mine and suggested adding an MP3 app to better my access to sounds/music. I can only hope it downloaded correctly to my phone from Amazon because I haven't had a use for it since. If I ever need an app, for my phone, Amazon seems to have them all."

I was a Power user according to the app. Then came the most recent update...I can no longer play the songs I uploaded to the cloud. I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed. Based on the reviews I have seen here, it seems I am far from the only one who has had this problem. If the app has received this many one star reviews in a short period and nothing is being done to fix it, it should tell us something."

But, I actually do like having access to the music I have purchased as CDs as digital media. I also enjoy having access to some of the music Prime has available for no extra purchase. It works best on my PC."
1055,"Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"amazon has let me down i updated this today and didnt realize the slap in the face I would receive. the previous policy was to buy an album in a year's time from amazon and your new amazon music and your old imported music could live happily ever after. not anymore. now they want a 25 dollar yearly subscription just to keep my already imported music on there. i love most of the things you do amazon, and this cloud player was previously my favorite. now instead of beaming about this service, which i have done for the past year or more, i will be expressing my extreme disappointment."
1061,"Amazon",2016-08-30,4,"Great place to be I love prime music because I can select all my favorite artists and songs into the library which can play the whole day. It is better than Pandora because there is no Ads. I think everyone should have it."

1069,"Amazon",2014-09-25,5,"Made a 10 hour playlist in about an hour! This service is outstanding! No more scouring around grabbing potentially dangerous material from Pirate Bay, not to mention the endless hours taking all of that and making playlists!

I am not a novice to these sorts of things and there are aspects of the user interface that are just not and could be intuitive. The player controls need some work should be a Stop button."

Wth Amazon?!?!?"
1078,"Amazon",2017-10-25,1,"This is a joke. If I could rate this less than one star, I would. I already pay for Prime. I am not paying for more. This is almost as bad as the video. I will just get my music somewhere else."

I do not have to any longer. My SAT radio always had a tin quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing. I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times. it is just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming. It sounds so much better. Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription! it is all there, in one place. You would not think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you? So, stop feeding the SAT company. Prime is where it is at! Best of the best!!!"

1205,"Amazon",2013-12-03,4,"Reasonable app, particularly if one is looking to add to one’s library of music The app works well and I would have given it five stars if not for one minor music preview contention. While listening to the short clip usually after about ten seconds of a song one is considering adding to the collection it is sometimes unresponsive to switch to another song. Mind you this is not an issue for songs on the device, only those one might navigate through in making choices about new music to add purchase."

I kept using it since my info was stored on amazon for non- dloads and they have a paymeent system The MP3 app is SO So Lame, this app sucks and so does the tech support. Of course they set it up to make it easy to dload stuff you do not even want. you would think Amazon would invest some money in tech support to keep their vending machine taking in money.

1305,"Amazon",2014-10-14,3,"No SD card support and some recordings not original I really was not sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it is just OK since the app is not all that bad lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I would have to stay with 3 stars.Issue number 1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I could not move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can not play any prime music, but that is OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue number 2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that did not make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I am sure there are many more. Disappointing."
1310,"Amazon",2016-04-25,5,"I love the Amazon Music I love the Amazon Music. I listed to it while at work and while on the road. I will stay on Amazon Prime just to have the music, movies and shipping. I end up shopping more but I love it for the convenience."

1322,"Amazon",2014-07-29,2,"Buggy on my device It is skipping/stuttering music that has been downloaded to my device. It spins continuously instead of actually playing music streamed from the cloud. It quickly consumes resources on the device to the point that I have to restart the device to gain back control."
1325,"Amazon",2015-02-27,4,"Like it, one request I love having amazon prime music, the only request I have for the app is the ability to set a standard page for when you open the app. It always defaults to the album list but I want to be able to set it to the artist list.

It said I could get mp3's of some music I had previously bought from Amazon, and it said it went to get them and downloaded them for me, and even showed me a list of artists that made sense as I had bought all those artists, but nothing was actually downloaded and my song list is empty. I will come back and try it again sometime maybe when it works properly."

1372,"Amazon",2014-06-18,2,"I want the old version back! The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list. On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the now playing screen inside the app, but they do not work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth. The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first. This is beyond annoying! And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state. I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do. This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public. It makes me regret downloading the update."
1375,"Amazon",2013-01-10,5,"The cloud player for me Terrific concept: just what a cloud player should be! Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer. Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there is a bit of wading thru just to remember what is on there."

1397,"Amazon",2016-06-27,2,"Two Stars App constantly crashes, and won update give an error 505."
1398,"Amazon",2016-02-17,1,"Intentionally broken. This app works on all devices EXCEPT my Fire phone running CyanogenMod 11, and it appears that Amazon has intentionally written the Prime Music app to crash on launch if it is running on a Fire device with a custom ROM."
1401,"Amazon",2017-10-03,5,"Love this App. I love this App. It is so much more convenient than regular radio or cds. I would recommend to anyone."
1403,"Amazon",2015-05-18,3,"Three Stars would be better if there were parental controls or some type of filters for explicit music"
1405,"Amazon",2014-06-14,1,"device issues I have a fair amount of music from Amazon, and an Amazon Prime account, so was quite excited to hear about their new streaming service. Mostly I listen to music with a Samsung Galaxy Player 3.6, which has always worked great. When I tried to update my Amazon mp3 player, it just vanished, and will not recognize this new app. Now I have lost the ability to play any of my Amazon music on my primary player. No lwhere did I see something saying the new app did not work with gingerbread. Heads up Amazon, there are still a lot of gingerbread devices out there, especially smaller specialty devices."
1406,"Amazon",2016-02-18,4,"Best music app if a prime member Great variety, I wish they had more of a selection for stations though, a more detailed option of music. I like being able to see the lyrics and download the songs and playlist. Unlimited slips and ad free is the best."
1407,"Amazon",2017-05-06,4,"Lyrics are great. I like how the lyrics are posted for some of the songs. It really is a great add on considering Amazon music is only one to do it."
1410,"Amazon",2017-06-04,5,"Five Stars Outstanding!!"
1411,"Amazon",2016-10-20,1,"One Star I thought it was free"
1414,"Amazon",2016-05-15,5,"Ten stars This app alone is worth paying for a Prime membership if you are a music lover! Use this all the time! Amazing selection. I quit using the other music app that shall not be named after getting this."
1415,"Amazon",2014-11-02,1,"Create Better Apps This app is SLOW. Hit the screen and wait for a response for two seconds... Then watch the app crash because you told it to do more than one thing at a time. I download it to get my mp3s then I uninstall it. This is the case on my Droid Maxx, My Nexus 7 and my Nexus 10. Also my Mac and PC apps are crap too just like this one."
1424,"Amazon",2016-11-01,4,"Four Stars pretty good app!"
1430,"Amazon",2015-02-28,5,"Five Stars All Stone Barrington's books are excellent"
1438,"Amazon",2017-01-25,5,"PLeasantly surprised and a nice bonus for being an Amazon user Surprised I am liking this so much, for I am a Spotify girl. I find it latches on to my taste better than some other music apps I have tried."
1439,"Amazon",2016-08-09,5,"Love it! Excellent library of music. So easy to use! Love! We checked other services for a few oldies and they did not have. So far, Amazon has nearly every song we are looking for!"
1445,"Amazon",2016-05-01,5,"I is extremely easy to use This has now become my staple music player. I is extremely easy to use, intuitive, and fast. I love the face that it will play my stored music on the device as well as from the Amazon cloud library."
1447,"Amazon",2016-10-18,1,"One Star will not stay in place"
1450,"Amazon",2015-06-23,2,"Not a great experience Crashing constantly and requests to send a report on a daily basis, sometimes several times.Have not even used it properly yet.I do not like posting a review like this for anything on amazon because they have always been efficent and very customer oriented in my experience."
1454,"Amazon",2015-08-16,1,"Amazon Music A Disappointment Very limited selection of music that fits my taste. Not easy to like a new song while driving: seems to require three steps vs. Goggle Play Music's one. I was hoping I could replace Google with Amazon and save some dollar , but that is not going to happen."
1457,"Amazon",2017-08-10,5,"2 thumbs up Love it...easy too use..just as good if not better than most music apps"
1461,"Amazon",2016-12-10,5,"I love Amazon Music I love Amazon Music, it is awesome! They have great stations playing the latest hits and you can listen to anything that is out there right now!"
1462,"Amazon",2017-05-30,4,"Four Stars So far I like it. I have only come across a couple of songs that it Alexa cannot find."
1464,"Amazon",2016-10-08,5,"Wow, this feature rocks! Any song you want ... Wow, this feature rocks! Any song you want streamed to any device plus hosts all the music you buy. Switched all my listening and streaming to this service."
1470,"Amazon",2014-12-29,3,"Bait and switch This review refers to the Amazon Prime music library:A lot of re-records even on songs that do not specifiy it, live versions, obscure songs by artists, and waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much Christmas music instead of regular music. Streams well and sound quality is good, but selection is somewhat disappointing."
1477,"Amazon",2015-06-23,2,"If it worked, it would be great It always freezes, crashes, and it never plays more than 1 song before it wont load more.I only gave it a 2nd star because i like the idea of the app"
1479,"Amazon",2014-06-22,3,"Cannot run with it on a IPOD nano, too soon to tell, not tried it enough too soon to tell. Not explored enough. Tried it on mobile and didnt work too well. email again in 3 months. Not sure if this is the way to go or itunes. Only works when connected to the cloud. I run with my ipod nano and shuffle, tiny devices. Will not work there unless Amazon comes up with a way to interface to the ipod or comes out with its own nano."
1480,"Amazon",2017-08-29,1,"Dont know why I have yet to be able to log on to the app."
1481,"Amazon",2016-08-08,5,"love it now Really awesome unless you have a cheap Android like I used to have after upgrading my phone and using T-Mobile Service it works like a champ guess you get what you pay for"
1495,"Amazon",2014-07-26,5,"Best music app on the Internet Great app. Amazon lets you download a lot of free music if you are a Prime member. I have been a prime member for years and it is one of the best investments I make. Even with the price going up, it is still a bargain. Plus you get a lot of free movies. Thanks Amazon. I only wish you could make more money as my stock would be a little higher."
1500,"Amazon",2015-08-24,4,"ok ok"
1502,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"I love this app Very user friendly!"
1505,"Amazon",2015-05-13,4,"Like it but not sure what to think.... Love the idea of being able to play the same song again but I am suspect of the idea that if I do it too many times song was on repeat as backdrop to my working the song suddenly becomes unavailable in Prime Music, which means the only way to hear the song again is to buy it."
1508,"Amazon",2017-09-26,5,"Five Stars What not to like."
1511,"Amazon",2014-06-15,5,"Great Product. I enjoying using it. It is so very easy to use. I like being able to add extra Prime music."
1515,"Amazon",2016-04-29,4,"Fine app I am really enjoying the choices and the music. I have been able to find music that I enjoy time and again. My only issue, I can not always find what I had before. But that could be the user. happy"
1520,"Amazon",2015-02-05,5,"Works every where! The Best music purchasing service since Napster circa 1999; works on everything I own. I buy and a copy of the purchase downloads to my home PC! They music plays every where but it is nice to have a copy just in case. Love Prime Music.I just wish Prime Instant Video would learn from this app."
1521,"Amazon",2014-06-20,1,"You can not save and download and it is kludgy With all the good music services out there - this is a weak contender. You can not download and save and it takes up WAY too much memory on a phone for just being a player. It gets one star rather than zero since Prime members get it free. The download process from the Amazon store for Android has too many steps. it is easier from the Google store."
1524,"Amazon",2017-02-18,5,"Buy for Alexa use I have this integrated into Alexa and it is great. The music selection is great but Pandora kicks in when certain songs are not listed."
1526,"Amazon",2016-12-19,5,"Great, music included Amazon prime is the best service for it is price. 100 bucks for free 2 day shipping, Amazon videoand music. My most used apps. Thank you."
1527,"Amazon",2016-10-09,4,"I dont have to pay extra to stream music I love Prime Music, streaming is tricky with artist not wanting to be on certain services but most of the artist I want to hear is on here so it is great."
1528,"Amazon",2014-09-24,1,"terrible changes With this app the sync on my car no longer functions. Can only change songs by unlocking my phone and going to the app. I no longer have to quick access from my locked screen. It has made using my app player non functional during my long commute. It also wiped out all of my saved playlists when I updated. Not happy at all."
1530,"Amazon",2016-06-15,5,"Great Fun to listen to the songs they have on Prime Music"
1533,"Amazon",2016-02-02,4,"Especially annoying when listening to live albums and albums where the ... Not sure if it is just me but this app will not play albums without a pause between tracks. Especially annoying when listening to live albums and albums where the tracks blend together. 5 stars if that gets fixed."
1537,"Amazon",2014-07-05,2,"Disappointing... The application fails randomly and frequently. I have friends who have no problems with this app, but then I have a multitude of difficulties and am left to wonder why. The service would be great if the player functioned properly. But until the day the application functions correctly I cannot rate the Prime Music player any higher than 2 stars."
1538,"Amazon",2017-02-21,3,"Keeps playing songs that I do not like after I dislike them Keeps playing songs that I do not like after I dislike them.. and I would like to see more to pick from. I been looking for some AC/DC"
1540,"Amazon",2017-05-10,4,"Pandora junkie Way better than i thought it would be! And that is coming from someone who listens to Pandora all the time!"
1541,"Amazon",2017-04-28,4,"Four Stars Really great for most music. Definitely a step above Spotify but some songs require the unlimited version."
1542,"Amazon",2015-07-26,5,"Love this app Love this app. It is like Pandora but better because it does not have commercials and lets you go back and forward as many times as you would like."
1545,"Amazon",2015-10-27,5,"Five Stars Love the vast selection!"
1547,"Amazon",2016-06-07,4,"Four Stars Only real complaint is the limited library selection"
1548,"Amazon",2016-09-02,4,"Works pretty well, the navigation can be a bit vexing ... Works pretty well, the navigation can be a bit vexing on mobile, but the music library is solid, and building mobile playlists trumps spotify's free mobile app."
1553,"Amazon",2016-09-29,4,"Four Stars item as described"
1557,"Amazon",2016-06-24,5,"Five Stars A must have for Prime members that love music!"
1558,"Amazon",2016-12-20,3,"Nice interface and good selection but not available on enough ... Nice interface and good selection but not available on enough products. I would like to be able to use it on my smart TV or XBox One."
1560,"Amazon",2015-03-15,4,"OK player, quality So So. Predictions here for music that I like were not very on the mark, as far as the playlists went.quality could have been better , definitely has some competition out there . But I would say good addition to Prime membership for no additional money ,even the Prime membership went up AGAIN!"
1561,"Amazon",2017-03-13,5,"Fair enough So far so good. I wish I could every song that i like. However the variety is good enough."
1562,"Amazon",2017-05-03,1,"Complete waste of megabytes Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay dollar 9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay dollar 9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible"
1564,"Amazon",2016-11-01,5,"Five Stars Enjoy!"
1567,"Amazon",2016-10-22,1,"One Star Not good."
1568,"Amazon",2016-03-31,2,"The service did not work with my Samsung six phone ... The service did not work with my Samsung six phone. I feel this is an issue with my phone. The battery had to be charged after the download. I attempt the process twice and had the same issue."
1569,"Amazon",2015-02-06,2,"Great for prime music, horrible for your device. It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device. Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up. Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
1570,"Amazon",2016-11-04,5,"Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options! I love my playlists and the fact that i can download to my phone for offline use."
1572,"Amazon",2012-12-27,3,"One Caveat This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."
1583,"Amazon",2014-06-15,1,"AWFUL UPDATE This latest update is AWFUL!!! Why should it take over 2 minutes to start playing an mp3 using the app when the mp3 is on my phone. Come on Amazon! Any one know how I can go back to the previous version? You know... the one that worked??? This is a mess."
1585,"Amazon",2017-05-08,5,"Love it. Everything I can think of is right here in Amazon prime music. I love my Amazon prime music. let us go."
1590,"Amazon",2016-03-13,3,"So Amazon is great and cloud music and bad at mp3s So so, I preffer google play for listening to my songs not in the cloud and almost all of my music is not in the cloud and I do not want it there. So Amazon is great and cloud music and bad at mp3s."
1594,"Amazon",2014-07-14,1,"Ugh. This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you did not purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your large music library is not from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."
1596,"Amazon",2016-02-04,2,"Mobile Unfriendly What does a genre channel play the same songs at start of every play session? it is as if I have an old school mix tape and it is the same every time?Haven't tried via PC, but have higher hopes."
1598,"Amazon",2017-03-17,5,"Five Stars Great! So far I have had nothing but good experience with this product and the firestick."
1599,"Amazon",2015-04-20,3,"Good, but could use a better interface. I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials, but listening to a particular genre is not so easy. It would help to have a seed song that guides the following songs. Also, not all artists are available, so it makes getting started a little more troublesome."
1600,"Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"The best music service we have used Love this prime service. We use it all the time. Especially nice now that we have the Amazon Firestick and can play music through the TV."
1606,"Amazon",2016-02-22,5,"Music all day... I love that I do not have to think too hard with the Prime Music playlists! There are all types of playlists and moods to suit the listener. I have been recommending this to everyone with a Prime account!"

1613,"Amazon",2016-08-28,4,"4 Stars for 90 percent Great app, but still only have 90 percent of the songs I am looking for. Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all, but until then.. 4 stars"

1635,"Amazon",2015-10-04,5,"Fabulous App LOVE Amazon Prime Music! The 90's alternative playlist is great and unlike other music apps, it actually plays music I recognize from the 90's. I love that I can download songs and play them when I do not have wifi to save my data. A"
1639,"Amazon",2015-11-21,5,"Better than Rhapsody This app is way better than most of the competitors out there. I also have rhapsody and it is horrible unless your somewhere that has a strong wifi signal. This app actually works sometimes with just the mobile network."

1647,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"Try it-you will not be sorry. So many albums and playlists to choose from in all genres, and all for free as a member! I use both video and music-a really good deal for less than dollar 10 a month now, in my first year."
1648,"Amazon",2017-06-25,4,"Like it a lot. I like it a lot compared to other apps. Wish I could add whole albums to playlist."
1654,"Amazon",2016-08-04,1,"why why it so hard to get music"
1660,"Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music is better than Pandora Commercial free Radio. Skip any number of times. Many different genres to choose from. Amazon Music is better than Pandora, better than Spotify, and better than Sound Cloud."
1662,"Amazon",2011-11-12,3,"Could be killer Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large 18K song music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service will not allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and does not handle changes to playlists well."
1663,"Amazon",2015-01-23,2,"Fix this thing! Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
1665,"Amazon",2016-06-27,5,"Many music genres to choose for your listening pleasure I like the amount of genres selection."
1666,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"Love, love, love it!!! I downloaded Prime Music on Prime Day and just love it!

1751,"Amazon",2012-08-02,1,"shame on Amazon for the bait and switch with AMAZON MP3 Amazon cloud where all your music is stored with unlimited space was supposed to be free with my Kindle Fire. plus I am already paying dollar 70 a year for Amazon Prime! The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free or when you purchase music from them. that is where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet will not be a Kindle."

2015,"Amazon",2016-07-12,5,"Great app if you are a Prime user Good selection of music. Rivals Pandora and other streaming services because NO ADS. you are already paying for Prime- take advantage of this!"
2016,"Amazon",2013-06-16,4,"Easy to use The app is easy to use, both for Android and PC. My only gripe -- and it is less about the app than the songs that can not be saved to the cloud -- is that when I purchase a CD on Amazon, only some of the songs transfer to the cloud. In some cases, very few of the songs. I am guessing this is a copyright issue, but it is disappointing nonetheless. If not for that, I would give the app 5 stars."

2025,"Amazon",2015-07-14,5,"I love, love I love, love, love, love, love Amazon Prime and the mobile app! I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about dollar 30 per month to just th dollar 100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I have ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I could not stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library. did not have to do a single thing but open up her back up and watch all the musical geniuses roll in. I give this app 10 stars out of 5. Way more than I expected for the money."

2043,"Amazon",2011-10-13,5,"Good app, but needs on-device playlist backup This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. it is a real problem when you create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."

2173,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ? Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud will not let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for dollar 24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes I have comcast. I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You do not even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer. My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. do not get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"

It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I have always installed from the play store, let us see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE, LG G3, that just might run amazon prime music, but it is just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
2194,"Amazon",2015-06-08,4,"Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars ... Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it will not transfer all of your music in your library. I cracked my screen on my phone and had to get a replacement... was disappointed when all of my music did not transfer."
2197,"Amazon",2015-01-07,1,"can not download to sd The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device. Butwtf is the deal with not allowing downloaded data to be stored on external sd? Fills up device storage quickly! Amazon should be providing better service rather than trying to be like Apple."
2198,"Amazon",2014-06-17,1,"Bad music for me Loaded it on my android phone an removed ten minutes later. Let me know when there are options available other than POP. I even looked at the Latin selections, looked pretty miserable.Pandora has it right!"

2205,"Amazon",2017-03-16,1,"Amazon does not support Blackberry Android After a lot of back-and-forth escalating to a manager in the tech area, finally Amazon said they specifically stopped supporting Blackberry Android systems."

2211,"Amazon",2013-08-20,3,"MP3 Kindle If you are not a tech, it hard to use the cloud and sinc of your play list to the Kindle. Instructions are over the top and hard to get your arms around it. The younger generation has had IPOD forever and it is a no brainer but me being a baby boomer, it take a little more information and asking questions to several other people to get it all working right!"

2219,"Amazon",2015-12-23,1,"does not work on tablet Prime music works on my phone but not my Samsung galaxy pro tablet. Have tried reinstalling multiple times and it still does not work. Would rate 4 if it worked on both devices."
2224,"Amazon",2014-09-13,2,"Could be much better. I expect more of Amazon. UI anyone? The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."

2226,"Amazon",2015-03-30,5,"Excellent Selection, Plays without skips in high quality Excellent Selection, Plays without skips in high quality. No timeouts. My opinion is that it is better than Pandora's One pay version."

2229,"Amazon",2014-07-28,3,"Neh... It prompts me that I need to be prime to use it, even though I am already prime user.

2402,"Amazon",2014-12-14,5,"Great feature adds to what already made prime worth it, warning use on wifi only. That data cap will get ya When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I am still poor sad but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I do not even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living."

There was a wide selection of music that I could stream integrated with my own music library, but after a few days it started to become glitchy. When I opened another music player, suddenly I could not see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions.

Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my musichave over 3500 songs mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over 500 songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating 300 of themover 800 additional on my SD card. So I hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I do not select report the crash the music still plays, however I can not see what is playing. I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal and a 64GB SD card. Found the best work around is to force a stop on the app and delete cache, restart the phone then try again to play music.Is this anyway to listen to your music? do not THINK SO!!!!

3103,"Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"BAH! Amazon Music with Prime I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it is totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I have emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall yesterday. What a pain. I definitely do not want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I am listening to. Who cares? And that is an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I do not like this and I am very unhappy with it? I am starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

I can tell you that the mp3 version will not let me download music files nor can I access the cloud where I supposedly have music that I have placed in my library.The whole thing is..."

I looked at it today because I will be on a 10-hr flight this summer each way and I need music to listen to OFF-LINE so I do not die from boredom.Whoppie! This is awesome!I am downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free. I was upset last year to learn that I could only download music I PURCHASED on Amazon to my computer, but the reason I wanted to do that is so I could put the music on phone. This is soooo much easier. Thank you, Amazon Prime!"

4158,"Amazon",2016-08-19,5,"Music must have app I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it is made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it is not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it is easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on my phone so I do not have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime."

4542,"Amazon",2017-04-25,1,"Amazon music app is abysmal and should be avoided at all cost This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse. It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often. Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along. All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it did not add them to my phone. I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more."

4805,"Amazon",2015-08-06,5,"Five Stars Great!!!"
4807,"Amazon",2012-09-25,1,"So is anyone besides me upset? nay - mad? So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. Seriously? Google? I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame. I did not care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it is MP3 then store it all here!! SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that will not ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom. So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - City ID is one that is dollar 2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!After a month I was all done.Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs 250 - how laughable! NOT! ... unless I pay dollar 24.95 a year?Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said it is free! I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of dollar 25 bucks a year just months later?And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!! Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I have got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot download an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The Artist column can not be expanded for example. You can not sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over dollar 24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a you must agree to this message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!Yes. I am just that mad."

Some of my old favorites from the 70's / 80's / 90's were in my original collection, but then were pulled out i.e., Neil Young and not available for free I pay for Amazon Prime, so it is not exactly free.Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline. This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz. Must have tunes when driving! I just bought a holder for the phone so that I will be able to hear the music and advance through the selections hands free.Streaming quality is great.

I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can not get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it is a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it is the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and looking elsewhere. it is a real shame they can not make this product work correctly."

A little high on price for some of the songs and albums you have to pay for. Also I have found that some of the selections do not let you know that the songs are for karaoke so there are no vocals in the music just the instruments. And you do not find out until after you download it."

9647,"Amazon",2014-11-03,1,"Like others have said Like others have said, I too consider this the absolute worst application I have ever used. Why, Amazon, have you made this so difficult? I have spent 25 years in IT, and believe me when I say, this is the most frustrating and non-intuitive application I have ever used. The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!! Really?? In this day and age?? Did you not test this before dumping this on us?? I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just do not have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software."

10533,"Amazon",2016-11-19,1,"Great, if it works. Loved it at first. It was pre-installed bloatware on my Note 5 but since I was a Prime member I started using it. Lots of great music, easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache, no change, Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said, it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it is possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally."

10580,"Amazon",2014-09-05,1,"Not all its made up to be. There are many popular songs that are unavailable. You can not download any songs to your computer hard drive, you have to work in the cloud. If you find a song that you like you may have to pay for it. I guess I had the wrong idea about it. I thought all songs would be free and available to do anything that I wanted to do with them. This is not the case, it seems to be very restrictive. So as you peel back the layers of the onion, its not all its cracked up to be."

10776,"Amazon",2013-02-07,4,"syncs music very well to multiple devices The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"

10921,"Amazon",2012-02-14,5,"Simple, Secure, and Safe Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's cloud was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go.The MP3 downloader was even easier...Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I do not have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! YAY!!! happy"
10923,"Amazon",2012-01-30,5,"wonderful Very easy to use, no worrys, sound is great, lay out is good. Easy to find songs and albums. Like the player and eq."
10928,"Amazon",2014-10-23,4,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums ... Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I am not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it is not a big deal.Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone 3.5 phone. I also see that it runs a bit sluggish 1 ghz phone.Again, pretty good app and I am happy with it. Hopefully we will see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
10932,"Amazon",2011-10-09,1,"No more free song Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star."

10941,"Amazon",2014-10-27,4,"A Must for Amazon Prime Subscribers This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available. Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus 7 tablet and Android phone Galaxy S 5. Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services. The pre-selected playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good. I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account. I have not purchased any songs or albums. The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use."
10942,"Amazon",2012-02-21,2,"I really want to live this app, and I ss I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days.and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker.I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloudThis review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint"

10950,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Auto-Rip Rocks! I am an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I am still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it is still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I am enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
10954,"Amazon",2016-06-08,5,"Get Yo Jammin' On! I absolutely LOVE this feature! This app is AMAZING! I really do not know how i listened to music before this! If you have Prime, or your thinking about getting Prime, get this app. You wont regret it!"

10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App I can not get enough of Amazon prime music. The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app. The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10962,"Amazon",2014-10-31,4,"Great extra with the prime membership Great extra with the prime membership. I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have. I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music. It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly. I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
10963,"Amazon",2015-01-10,1,"I would give it 0 starts if I could. AWFUL app It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5. I never could get it to recognize my amazon account, so I could not stream prime music or even retrieve albums I have purchased. It was a huge resource and battery hog too. After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it. Canceled my prime membership too."
10968,"Amazon",2017-02-01,1,"So much bugs After opening app, the first time after a while Add album to my music button is pressed I am redirected to an amazon prime screen, and the album I selected is lost. It takes multiple attempts to purchase mp3s. Headache after headache using the store."
10972,"Amazon",2012-08-01,5,"serves all of my music needs I have been using this app for a year on my android phone Verizon droid razr. I uploaded all of the music I own aprox 15gb to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android. I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download. A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me."
10974,"Amazon",2017-08-28,1,"Boooo Wife bought me a CD for my birthday and its not shared through her prime account...do we really both have to buy it that is retarded..."
10978,"Amazon",2017-03-30,5,"Five Stars I love my Amazon Music. It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime."
10979,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"does not work I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs will not download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to device vs sd card. How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that does not work and does not seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! you are better than this Amazon, I paid almost dollar 100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
10981,"Amazon",2013-02-23,4,"Cloud Player was mind changer for me. Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I do not like Bloatware . However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
10986,"Amazon",2011-04-26,1,"Not what I expect from Amazon I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can not find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they do not know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I do not want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.Great idea but the app is not ready for prime time."
10987,"Amazon",2016-01-19,2,"Great idea, but annoying I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it is practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.Back to Google play music I go. mad"
10989,"Amazon",2013-02-07,5,"Fantastic App!!! I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III Android phones and we love it. All of the CD's that we have ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming which worked great and saves space on your phone or downloading for listening when you do not have cell service. You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone. it is great!"
10995,"Amazon",2014-10-14,5,"Great Music App! Great music app with a ton of free music if you have Amazon Prime. I love it!"

11008,"Amazon",2017-06-04,5,"I love my Prime membership I am a music love and as such, will try out everything available. Amazon is the most recent musical trip I have taken and it might be that I have reached my home for music. I have been a Prime member for many years and it is paid for itself over and over. This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."
11010,"Amazon",2013-02-12,1,"Music only on internal storage? This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company."

11013,"Amazon",2014-10-13,1,"Frequent errors and crashes App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible"

11018,"Amazon",2014-10-09,4,"Worthwhile for Prime Members at Least As an Android user and an Amazon Prime member, I got this app to take advantage of the Prime Music Amazon now offers for free for their Prime subscribers. It is functional and the music selection has improved vastly since it started up this summer. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and have an Android device you might as well take advantage of this."
11021,"Amazon",2017-06-19,5,"Great app!! Unlike other music apps we have tried Amazon music does not have ads or commercials and I love that."
11024,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Better than Itunes I completely changed from Itunes due to their many restrictions. I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices. So Amazon music is the only place I now purchase from, and it is saved in my account for me to access at all times anywhere."
11027,"Amazon",2015-03-19,5,"... had this app since it came out and I love it. However I have had this app since it came out and I love it. However, last night I downloaded Android 5.1 to my phone, now Amazon music player crashes whenever I hit play on any Prime Music. Please fix!! My morning commute is not the same!!UPDATE 3/23/15: got the 5.1 fix installed, happy days are here again! Changing to 5 stars, thanks Amazon!"
11028,"Amazon",2014-10-24,1,"OnePlus and Ouya compatibility Hugely unstable on OnePlus One and apparently other OPO devices for several subsequent releases. Unusably flaky on an Ouya. Amazon kindly flags the app as uninstallable on the OnePlus in the Google Play store, but still enables access to the app on both devices through their own. Left hand, meet right hand. Or better yet: Just fix it."
11035,"Amazon",2013-06-05,3,"Is constantly looking for the cloud The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone."
11044,"Amazon",2013-02-11,5,"10 STARS Perfect. Fast downloads. Much better than itunes. The new auto-rip feature for cds is wonderful. I hope it will include vinyl in the future. Sooner rather than later Love it love it love it!!!"
11045,"Amazon",2015-09-02,5,"Really quite good This is really really good. What can I say? All sorts of music, even the obscure stuff that I like. Free to stream within your annual prime subscription. I stream musiic at home, at work and on the train. The movies are rubbish, but the music and free next day delivery are worth the £70 a year."

11069,"Amazon",2013-04-13,4,"Simple but Helpful it is a nice app, but there is not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you are just listening to music.

11646,"Amazon",2015-05-13,1,"Expected better from Amazon... The interface is terribly confusing and incredibly difficult to navigate. it is hard to figure out how to even get to your music. it is a resource hog. You can not control whether it downloads to your internal memory or SD card. If a download of purchased tracks fails which it usually does the Download Failed message can not be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running since some process of it is ALWAYS running. You have to reboot the phone in order to clear any stray items it leaves in your notifications.Just give us something that lets us download the tracks we purchased so we can use whatever player we want."

11654,"Amazon",2012-08-01,1,"Finally went too far I am a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really is not worth the new dollar 25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."
11656,"Amazon",2013-12-10,1,"no longer a fan I used to love the app. It used to work well and it sounded wonderful playing in my cars speakers. I used to tell my friends about it but now....not so much. Ever since the last update it randomly stutters when playing a song or stops competely. I can not get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate. Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan."

11679,"Amazon",2015-01-13,1,"If its not broke, fix it until it is!! I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had meaning songs I did not download from Amazon. I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device why would not they be?, yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I am offline. Even albums I have purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc, yet for some reason the app does not want to play them anymore unless I am connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for offline play if I can only play them when I am online? I do not know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I am not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I am at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library does not work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."
11681,"Amazon",2015-03-23,5,"ty sooo o much Awesome"

11689,"Amazon",2016-11-20,1,"will not work Thought this was included with prime .. will not even open."
11693,"Amazon",2016-11-05,1,"Awful Hardly any control over media. You can not even use it in the background or capture media while in other apps like Snapchat. do not even bother purchasing from Amazon music anymore. Stick to iTunes. Thumbs way down."
11694,"Amazon",2016-04-21,1,"What happened, Amazon? Stopped the ability to play DL Prime content without verifying first, which is not the point of offline playback. Offline recordings cached well with a data connection, but like I said in the first sentence this is not the definition of Offline playback.Cleared cache, reinstalled, etc. to no avail. Guess I am paying for Google Play again even though I already have paid for my Prime."
11697,"Amazon",2016-11-15,1,"Angry!!! I paid dollar 100 for my fire TV and dollar 50 for the game controller and Amazon issues and update that makes me hunt through nested menus for purchased music that was originally accessible from the home screen. Updates are supposed to make apps easier to use not harder with more fees. If I start seeing advertisements the app I am gonna demand a refund for my fire TV. The best word to describe the Amazon music cloud is volatile . I literally lost purchased music because Amazon stopped the album. Even uploaded music is subject to the volatility of Amazon's music market. If Amazon made a straight up media player app they would not have a problem. I download everything I buy because I can not trust Amazon to keep it for me."
11709,"Amazon",2017-10-19,1,"Fatally flawed by the company's greed and stupidity What a terrible service! We already pay dollar 105/year for Amazon Prime, so you would think the company would not stiff us with ridiculous tactics like graying out songs on my playlists, which I can not play unless I upgrade to the monthly subscription music service! Why provide the free service then? Meaning, the service we already pay dollar 105/year for, in our Amazon Prime membership? And why does the company gray out other songs in my playlist, saying this song is no longer available. ??? A song out of copyright, and more than 70 years old? Really? I believe this is the lowest scummy sort of pressure to try to make customers switch to the paid service. Tell you what. I am leaving Amazon Prime music and will be very happy paying whatever Spofity charges. I hear they have more songs anyway. Amazon has nothing by Led Zeppelin for example. This Amazon Prime Music is fatally flawed by the company's greed and stupidity."
11711,"Amazon",2016-01-05,2,"it is not entirely terrible. A few things I liked about it was ... I was expecting a bit more from this app.do not get me wrong though,it is not entirely terrible.A few things I liked about it was the addition of lyrics to some songs and how simple it was to look for music and buy an artist's album. However,I did experience some issues.The fact that when I was listening to a song and lost my internet connection, the song would start all over and you are forced to listen to the entire song all again once connection has been restored.Another thing I disliked about Prime Music was the fact that there is not many artists.Only really known ones.One of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information.Like no thank you.I ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it took up a lot of space on my phone.I would rather stick to Pandora."
11712,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Getting better with age I have been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating. The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers. It is truly a great value added service."
11717,"Amazon",2015-08-05,5,"Luv Everything Amazon This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that is bc it does SO MUCH! I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' and that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist and that made the app a piece of crap. Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music. I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music. Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight?? if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot and prbly melt the phne. So, to me that is a useless comment and irrelevant. The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud and it does not use ANY Storage space on my device. If u own the music u can download to ur device it is fast! to play offline if u ever get stuck or just do not want to use data. And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android Samsung S5 user here. it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this: u can download aNY of the music u want. However, u can only move the music you own. Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 and MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card and the app will find it and play it. MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage. Hopefully, most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can not transfer and steal music u haven't purchased.I personally think this is a great app and that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I am a true believer."
11724,"Amazon",2016-03-16,3,"Good, but Amazon Prime Music has a lot of adapting to attract Millennials and stay ahead of other streaming music options. For the most part I am enjoying Prime music--both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres. I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I am definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access. At this point in time as a business woman and a graduate student, I feel that the dollar 50/year student membership fee is not worth it and most definitely not the regular membership fee."

I unistalled it and tried reinstalling it. Keep getting a error 505. Have the samsung s6 edge and still have trouble with this app. This is the only one i have problems with. Hope they get it fixed soon or ill be downloading another music app."
11727,"Amazon",2017-11-11,2,"If you want the best app ever, and have the dollar dollar for it, find something else. Prime music is actually so so. The Amazon music app is okay. I use it almost everyday. I am content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can not listen to.There have been a few errors with the program I have experienced. But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I will hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it is still loading.So, a little frustrated, I will start driving. It could not take that long could it?Sometimes it will come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times- 15 minutes down the road- The screen still has not popped up.Usually. After reaching my destination, I will close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can not say 100 percent who is at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.Anyhow. I will likely keep using it. I have been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I have come across.it is not convenient. I do not like it. But it will do."
11728,"Amazon",2014-01-17,1,"Incapable of storing music on SD card, which is idiotic This app insists on putting all your music on the phone's internal storage. There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.This problem has been known for YEARS. The developers have deliberately ignored it. They simply do not care about how useless this idiotic, pointless restriction makes the app.Amazon is pretty good at a lot of things, but when it comes to this app, it is amateur hour."
11729,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Terrible Service It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there . For a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from . I can download music to my phone or use Pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache"
11730,"Amazon",2014-04-02,1,"Streaming works great. Downloading does not work at all. I have been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it so I can put it in the car, and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I am now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which should not even be necessary in the first place, would not be able to do its job. it is not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you will end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50 percent of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been 01. Track Name.mp3 would end up just being called 01. Track N , with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I am not paying for bandwidth.it is difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they will give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."

Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I did not have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I am not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again. Bad move Amazon! I will not use iTunes so now I am in search of a different provider. great job - you just lost a customer."
11740,"Amazon",2015-09-27,1,"Barely functional This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I have got that done there is no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by say Artist I have got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching is not terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, m there is no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I am moved to a different search tab. This is not rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you are this app is doing is not better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it is laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. there is a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I am forced to use it when say interacting with my Echo."
11742,"Amazon",2016-08-12,5,"Great music app! Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line airplane mode to save battery life if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG-G3 updated last night 08-11-16, the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet."
11751,"Amazon",2016-02-24,1,"If this gets better, maybe it can rise to mediocre. Mediocre at best. The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information. You are forced to try one-- and if it is absolutely horrible to you? Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking no .. and after 3 or 5? You realize that station is not for you.But. The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck! Horrible!A simple description under each station is too much to ask? Or even just a category label? No? As if I am supposed to recognize these people after which the station is named... right?I would love to learn about new artists-- but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge i.e. cow hard country ... makes me ill.Where is a FILTER for the prime stations? I do not care what is popular! I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.One star, all but useless."
11753,"Amazon",2016-12-10,2,"Not a robust Music source Several issues with this software/service. It does not work on Roku yet except to access my purchased music. can not find other music or playlists. Then on my BLU Advance 5 phone Android from Amazon, the app hogs itself into the main memory of the phone and will not move to the added SD card. As a result like other Amazon apps, they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.Overall, on other platforms, I do not find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music, building playlists, or creating stations of my own. At this stage, I am staying on Pandora."
11757,"Amazon",2017-03-09,1,"Worst music player You buy music with this app, but you can not play it on any of your new devices. it is the worst. It does not let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called Ah fiddlesticks which means... awe, our music software can not play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device. What kind of non-sense is that?Asked a friend who tried Amazon Music once if it is even worth trying to register a device, and he said, Amazon Music has the worst possible audio software and makes your high quality mp3's sound very, very bad."
11758,"Amazon",2017-09-25,2,"This app needs work... I have 2 major complaints about the Amazon Music Android app.1. When playing music OFF-line from tracks that have already been downloaded to my device, playback frequently pauses, as if it is having a buffering problem similar to a streaming ON-line connection. the interruptions to playback are incredibly annoying and do not happen on any other music player using the same device.2. There is no way to auto-play music on bluetooth connect. When I start my car, I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established. The Amazon Music app does not support this feature. I have tried using other apps Bluetooth AutoStart and others and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect, but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone, it will transfer over to the car and keep playing, but, that is only if the Music app is already running.For example... Black Player music app will auto-play on bluetooth connect from a cold start. Black Player does not need to be running. It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off. This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you do not want it...If Black Player can do it... why can not Amazon?"
11760,"Amazon",2013-08-22,1,"I am no grandma, and this is truly the most complicated way to download music I have encountered Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I have been doing so since the Napster days.Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. it is bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me! . Wrong. it is genuinely terrible.Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than 20 new songs, I now have 200 duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space."

Huge quantity of music to select from2. Family plan works for my whole family - thank you Amazon for finally making this available.3. Integrated with AlexaCons:1. Stations and playlists are not curated/updated. Unlike Pandora or many other music services, the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same. For instance - any time you start the Classical station, the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma - EVERY TIME.. Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations.2. Variety of playlists and stations suck. They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3,4,5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you. I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion with commercials just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like. My kids use Spotify the majority of the time for this reason as well.I am sure Amazon will eventually catch up but with all their resources, they are very slow to add them."

I have reinstalled 3 times. I have uninstalled the update twice. I have refreshed about 10,000 times. Nothing helps.

I have been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car. Now, however, I can not get through a single song through the car without an error message exception 180 that stops the player cold. The error messages suggest I try again, but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I have PAID FOR from my device. This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Now, I have to find a music player that does not hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music will not play on any other player, that I have tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper. And, from what I am seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service has not even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it. What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."

Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others will not force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.I like it! it is really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever. I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels. Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora. Other than that, I like this app, I can pause, skip and shuffle.

11786,"Amazon",2017-01-02,2,"... Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon ... The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the dollar 14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. was not getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I do not have a 3 month credit so we were not able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. Credits do not seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo were not worth their cost. would not recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I will be sticking with Pandora."

I am sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I am guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally.

I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose ho with where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can’t spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. It’s the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered.

I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the music unlimited .

Music I have bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music will not play. And other songs that I have deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, will not play in a playlist. it is very frustrating. I have deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps.

With Prime music, one can select certain tracks to download and play on this app. However, the app tries to play songs from albums where I have downloaded other songs. For example, if I download My Life from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play Only the Good Die Young even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it is on music from the device only so that is not the issue.

There are pros and cons to each and everyone's preferences are different. For me, I like to pick a Genre or Style and have the app do the rest Pandora. On the other hand, I like to reminisce and find specific Artist Pandora,Spotify,Tidal.That being said, I do not like to have certain Genres shoved in my face everytime I open the app You Know who you Are. Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular Tidal and Spotify for SQ and Pandora and Spotify for Cellular.Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available Late 2016 I will cancel them as well.Hope this review is helpful, Thanks"

I do like that it gives you the opportunity to listen to and download music that I would not normally listen to or search for. I think as a Prime Member the subscription price should be lower than what it is. After the 30 trial I will make a decision to keep or stop, at this point I am not sure if it is worth it."

Only precaution-- you can not change the order of songs on your playlist once you have created it. The first song you save becomes the last one to play and the last one you save the first one that plays.

Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out ok and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it is losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify. Any searches take 10's of seconds to display anything and then when you click on anything it takes an age to open up, if it bothers at all.

Very hard to keep musical preferences clear As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music.But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.First, the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud, Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear, even my own music!Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player."
11842,"Amazon",2017-01-04,1,"Terrible app will not work I tried to get this app to run on my Lenovo Tab and installed it multiple times and all it does is crash. To bad as I wanted to use it with my Prime account. But can not get it to work. Guess I will use Google play instead. But that means I need to download my songs to my SD card."
11848,"Amazon",2014-11-13,3,"Not what I expected I was excited when I saw that you had a way to stream music and such. The promise of FREE Downloads and listening for Amazon Prime members was even more exciting. Until I actually saw that ONLY SPECIFIC MUSIC was free. This reminds me of ALL the other lies told when advertising something free: For your FREE credit report, you MUST enter your credit card number... perplexed REALLY??But overall it is better than what I had so that is why I say it is Okay."
11849,"Amazon",2017-01-05,1,"Simply Does Not Work Reliably Horribly buggy. I installed it on Mac and PC and iPhone. Uploaded an album from my Mac. Looked like it worked great, but: on the PC, every track in the album is listed 3 times, and the album does not appear at all on the iPhone app.This is bush-league crap written by amateurs. do not waste your time.would not it be wonderful if there was a cross-platform, cloud-based media solution that actually worked? So far, it does not exist, because the greedy bozos at Apple and Amazon are just not up to the task."
11865,"Amazon",2014-06-13,2,"Works on Some Devices, Not Others Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in airplane mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded did not show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you have already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice: Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."
11867,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Amazon Music Unlimited Review Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available. However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent. The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms. Play queue being an example. The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling. I am forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist. Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums. This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application. This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application. This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks. The ability to thumbs up / down or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms. If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow. It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing. This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to... Show me similar artist, records, songs. Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10. Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature. However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11. Android Screen controls. The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android. There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked all competitors have this functionality.Overall the service is adequate. There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market. I signed my family up for a year. They all hate it! We will give the service a fair shake over the year. If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again. I expected better from Amazon. Okay is not good enough."
11869,"Amazon",2015-08-21,5,"Yup it will keep me being Prime Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi. The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I do not watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."
11870,"Amazon",2015-01-06,5,"Would give 0 stars if possible Crashes every time I want to play a song that is downloaded to my device android 4.4 whether or not I am connected to the internet at the time. Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that are not downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. that is right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.UpdateThe app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign is not as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there."

I have used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's and that is not even that big of a library, up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.Amazon, get it together."
11872,"Amazon",2017-01-26,5,"Really Awesome!!!! Love Amazon music! it is great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free not really free because you pay for a prime membership but it is a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi perfect for airplanes. Would recommend this!!!"
11873,"Amazon",2012-10-24,4,"My go-to music app! UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012. My how times have changed. The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music. If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps. Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012. Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
11875,"Amazon",2015-06-10,1,"Takes up all my internal memory. Adding my voice here. Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB. Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage. Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but will not move prime music. I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it. Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone. You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected. You do not need to hog my internal memory. I guess you are only for top end phone users. I can not afford you.Listen from the cloud you say? Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and do not let the phone display go dark, the music stops. I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what? It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone. Music that I use other apps to play since those apps do not stop every 15 seconds. Amazon, I love you. But I hate your music app."
11881,"Amazon",2016-11-08,3,"I turned blue when the app did... but Amazon listens I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.CONS0 it is just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I am uploading or it decides to download something completely outside of my control it can not be used.EDIT***Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it is great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the see file on computer option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.1 On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point2 I can not STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something.. Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I do not believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.3 it is now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I do not understand the logic behind taking out.4 When I click make a playlist from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.PROSThe color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now.."
11891,"Amazon",2017-05-13,5,"Awesome with Unlimited With Unlimited, this is now my go to music app! Spotify does have more of a wealth of playlists, but I think Amazon will continue to improve in that regard."
11894,"Amazon",2015-08-08,5,"Grandpa Truck loves this app My Dad is a truck driver and he loves this app. manly because he can get all the music he likes into a playlist. He does not want to listen to other apps like Pandora because he wants to hear what he likes. This app lets him do that. Most of the music he likes is free to him with my prime amazon membership. Its easy for him to use, he is over 60 and has technical difficulty with working devices but this is easy for him."
11895,"Amazon",2015-11-02,4,"Great App; Perhaps More Rare or Obscure Tunes Added to Available Songs I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I have never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."

It keeps asking me to start free trial or make a payment. But ive already signed up, and am able to use the kindle book app and the Amazon prime video. So why music is not recognizing my account I do not know. But I have already called twice about this Amazon prime. It sucks having to constantly call for this stuff."

11908,"Amazon",2016-02-04,3,"Needs lots of TLC Received when I signed up for prime I normally use Spotify I like the fact that there is no commercials making a playlist works yet it does not allow you to import the playlist from Spotify. You have got to solve this problem also if I want to sort my playlist for instance alphabetically or when added to the playlist on the app it does not allow me to do that I have to manually sort everything. All in all I am happy with it but you guys have a lot of improvements that you have to make to catch up"
11913,"Amazon",2016-12-24,2,"Really Poor User Experience - come on Amazon you are better than this Wake up Amazon. You do a lot of great things, this app is not one of them. If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
11915,"Amazon",2013-12-12,1,"Needs an OFF button, too. I have only used this app a few times. The sound is good and it is handy, but each time I have used it when I am done listening and want to move on, I can not seem to find a way to turn this app OFF! None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop. Very hard to find a way to close the app. I have ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times. So although it is a convenient way to play the music I bought but forgot to download, I probably will not use it anymore."
11919,"Amazon",2016-06-19,5,"The only service you need Love Amazon music! Tons of freedom complete albums from all eras and genres. Plus great playlists and singles.

I purchase and download all of my music and generally have never streamed it, this was the first time. I only downloaded this app to my phone because I wanted my daughter to be able to play some select songs in the car. When I did the download I specifically chose not to start the service but just to add the app in order to play the music I had purchased, but in the process saw that prime of which I belong had some music groupings that might interest me. We enjoyed playing the music in the car for a short time using the app because I hadn't downloaded the music to my phone. It took a while before I realized the thing did not shut off. Got to work one day went to task manager and closed the app. Got out of work and realized it was still playing and had been ALL day, and using up my data. Pulled down the drop down menu and there it was, still playing. Just picked up my phone this morning and realized it has been playing some unknown music all night.................it is gone, going back to hooking up the phone and downloaded my purchased music that only costs me ONCE."

In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which is not why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I would use it.

So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory. it is like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it. They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps. You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card. But it does not always work. It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs. While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure. I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.

If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you are buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you would like. Amazon Music does not; Amazon Music says you will get .mp3 and you will like it. Of course, Amazon Music does not give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. that is right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.If you care about quality, I would not bother.

The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1 You can not store music on an SD card, and 2 You can not sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it is almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load even when they are on my device!, I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song will not change although the song title text and album art will!. It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I am quite certain it is not my device- I am using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I am giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that does not really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.Very disappointed, as releasing something this rough is very un-Amazon-like.

And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support. Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon does not care about us people with older phones. It makes the app nearly worthless."
11979,"Amazon",2016-02-21,2,"Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work everytime. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well, I am wrong. My husband has already declared it sucks! . But I do not listen as often and I have more mainstream tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no. Here is a short list of why I do not like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that, even though it is essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I would rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain will not recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are re-recorded versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I have not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. what is the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song good luck if you can find it on Prime Music . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."

As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I have been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It will not load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains running when it does not even work.The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things do not improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."

IIRC, it would not install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use. Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker.

That excitement did not last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you are looking for it displays the album art next to it, NOT the one you selected. Beyond that, takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I have got a super fast internet connection too, so that is not it.Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library, and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video, prime music, but SO HARD to find my own music I own.If performance for this app ever did get fixed, it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control.

I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I would used 1GB of data that I did not even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I have used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I would be paying now.Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it there is no off button and you can not get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise, and now it is got a pop up asking me to log in that you can not get out of by pressing the back button.

It does not have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they have been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.Also, I am really happy they have been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta. can not wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.One thing I would really like to see is a higher bit rate option. I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is.Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs were not designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."

It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable.If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally.

Songs will often repeat with no audio, but continue to stream. Makes this feature worthless, I got to go find the song in my cache folder and play it with another app.2. Uploading an album is terrible, since Amazon will often treat artists on the album as being in separate albums, resulting in me having multiple albums defined on my cloud, each made up of only the partial album I actually wanted organized.3. I used to get by this fine by just searching for the name of the album on the search function and playing out the results. This does not seem to work anymore as it ONLY plays whatever song I select off the results window, despite there being multiple results.

The latter has a near top-of-the-line processor still, 2gb of RAM, and over 96gb of memory over 50gb always free. However, on both devices, the program hogs so much resources it often freezes and stalls when on Prime Stations - the main use I have for it. No matter how many background resources I free up, how high a priority I give this app to run on my systems, it has these problems on Prime Stations. Oh, and my internet is a 17mb/s system, so no lack of resources there either: I would hate to try this on a 3 or 4g hookup. All too often, after a genre-station plays the first song/piece, the second buffers and *looks* like it is playing. But, the resources are so clogged that the *sound* is missing. Then when you try any of the controls to change songs or stations or genre, the app is non-responsive. And, shutting the app down will not free up your system, even force-closing it in the device's settings will not do it: you have to shut down and restart. Until Amazon programmers get this app in line with other music apps and reduces the resource grab, I would not waste the effort using this. The *only* possible use for it is to preview singular songs/pieces as long as they are free to Prime-members to see if your interested enough in getting it somewhere you can add it to your collection in an app that runs better."

Which would be ok, but it is not like you can have it build dynamic playlists for you based on your musical preferences, also no function for rating music not sure why Amazon does not easily provide this in their apps as this would seem obvious. I have been toying with Spotify considering if I want to spend my money on it or not, or maybe Google's streaming service. Amazon's players lack of features and usability does not do well to recommend their prime service. Luckily for them 2 day shipping is always what it is.Also the inability for 2 people to listen to Prime music at the same time is lame.*Update*The service is steadily improving, Would like to see the stations get added to the app as this would resolve an issue with it I have had for awhile. I would also like to see an Android Wear app for this to control playback."
12136,"Amazon",2013-12-09,1,"What was once good is no more. Until the last update, this was my primary listening app. Most of the music I listen to is stored on my SD card I have around 30 GB of music locally and the app would play it just fine. Now since the update, it apparently will not read from the SD card my other players still do, so I know they are there and there is no way to direct it to look in specific locations.I will not upload my entire collection to stream as that would be a waste of data and the limitations on Amazon MP3 make that a non-option anyway. I like purchasing music on the app as the prices are usually better than the alternatives, but until they fix the app back to the way it was, I will be downloading them to my computer, then transferring to my phone to use with a different app.Oh, the new interface blows as well."

Why is it so? Because when trying to create playlists, I can not read an entire id tag because it is too long. If you listen to classical music with the opus numbers at the end of the tag, you know what I mean. Fix this, and all the other glitches, Amazon, and you get a 5."

12158,"Amazon",2014-08-04,5,"Wonderful edition to Prime!!! Wonderful music app!!! Such an unexpected value! Love this music app! I am a lover of many different genres of music. From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc. I previously used Pandora and I ¢¾ Radio. Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better! I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping. It was well worth it. As a whim, I decided to try the music app. I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love! I was quickly creating my own playlist. I have created quite a library with so many different types of music. I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone. I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy. I find all of the process easy. The only warning is some songs that are free are rerecorded so watch for that and play samples before purchasing. Those songs are the minority, but can happen. If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library. It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews. I haven't shared their experiences at all. Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc. I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app! I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim. Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music. I simply search for artist and songs. Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love. I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also. I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free. So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices. This is a great gift in itself. I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."
12159,"Amazon",2017-08-18,2,"Nice Music Selection, Poor and Frustrating User Interface Great music selection available, but the user interface sucks. To delete an album from your library you have to delete EACH SONG 1 by 1! that is really bad by design IMHO. Why force users to waste time like that? Frustrating."
12160,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Updates to the app deletes content for all device playlists - forces streaming. I have and use this app daily. But the last two updates wiped out my device playlists. The playlist screen even has a little button to toggle between device and cloud. worked until the updates.... rebuilt the playlist on the device.... today's update? wiped out the playlist that was local. I do not want to have to hook up to every strange wi-fi signal I can get to stream my music - I download and play. Wiping out playlists is just wrong."
12162,"Amazon",2014-07-21,1,"Eats data like it tastes good. I have been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years. I have generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I am not super tech savvy. My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it is a pain in the rear apparently my files could not be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album would not. My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I would have to re-learn where everything was again. But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to 4.0.4.Which has sucked. I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed. I have found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason. I am not a big data consumer. My average data use over the past year or so does not usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month. I am on Wi-Fi more often than not at home and at work, so I am usually only streaming 3g/4g in the car. Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I am close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over 700 mb of data.In 4 days.When I am not using the app, I close it. It restarts itself. I close it again. It restarts again. And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off. Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I have never had before, and I am not just disappointed with the app. I am pretty well disgusted with it. If I am in my car, I can not fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it is still buffering. It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I have now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi. Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I have used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I will not likely abandon it right off the bat. I will take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library again, and move on. In the meantime, I am peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app will not just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I have previously enjoyed and recommended to others. That will not be happening again."

I can not seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I am listening to not a huge loss there. Navigation can be frustrating on a device. The web interface is a bit better. Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites. That would help me a bit. Also, how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order. Kinda like a radio. I would love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music.** Updated on 11-14-2014The Android app has gotten very good a new phone also helped.

Why is it that I have to add a song to the cloud in order to make a separate playlist. That very feature will cause accumulation of different music types. Also the lack of music choice feels significantly limited. Change the layout too it is just so boring and unorganized. Also add dates of albums to know what is new and maybe popularity LEVELS of music. there is potential but there a lot to work on. One thing I do like is the lyrics. But please look at your rivals and actually compete.-iPhone 6s user-"

Where do you think this app would create its default download directory? The local device of course. Well, just change the default download directory to the SD card and....oh wait a second, you can not. They do not permit this. So you buy their music and you can not store it on your SD card. Why do people buy SD cards in the first place? So they can store large files like photos, videos, and yes - MUSIC. Good job Amazon, good job!"
12243,"Amazon",2016-10-16,1,"This update sucks I actually relatively liked this app until the most recent update. I deleted some songs off my phone and wanted to re-download them, only to find out that the option is not available because on the app it lists it as already being downloaded. Not only that but the partner program on the computer has to have the most needlessly complicated way of uploading music to your Amazon music library, and that is if it even works. Literally worked fine the day prior, and now the program is barely running, and when it finally does run when I try and drag the songs I wanted to upload into my library, it says no songs were added."

I gave three starts only because the music is free, great sound quality, and its a convenient addition to my prime membership.That being said, I am not impressed with the service. it is too difficult to find the music you want and its ridiculous that you have to add prime songs to your library to listen to the full song. I will give them some credit because the service is fairly new, but COME ON MAN! YOU ARE AMAZON.COM! If you are going to compete with Spotify, Pandora, and soon to be YouTube then compete. I am giving it a chance, but wont be surprised is I revert back to using the unpaid Spotify service. As a prime member, I demand more and I expect more specially when it comes to music."
12264,"Amazon",2015-06-18,2,"Redesign needed deserpately I want to love this service so bad. It has a good selection of music and its included with prime so whats not to love? I will tell you...The entire set up is garbage. I do not know who they hired to design it but it is the most complicated way to listen to music that I have found to date. Before you can listen to songs you must add them to your library which then forces you to go to another screen to listen to them. What if you just want to listen once?The mobile app does not allow you to search by Artist. SERIOUSLY?They need to drop the shopping cart idea and take a good look at Google music. I do not want to jump through hoops to listen to music, It should just work with little effort. This is coming from someone who works in IT; sure I can figure all this out but I should not have to.

I have attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful.

Now it locks up or it just does not play music at all -- it attempts to play, but then skips to the next song. Real frustrating. I am satisfied with the music selection -- I do not expect to have everything, so that is ok. Love the playlists and the flexibility of arranging them on my PC. But Amazon really needs to work on this cloud issue. For the record, each morning, I restart my phone and clear my cache -- my phone is about 85 percent filled -- so I believe the issue is the Amazon. They need to get on this or lots of us are going to go to Spotify, Pandora etc. In addition, I am also have playback problems watching shows on my TV -- again, I did not have this problem 6 months ago.

I am loving the curated playlists and the music that is on them. In general there is a great selection of music in Prime.One piece of feedback... I can not do much more to interact with the playlists than rate a playlist overall. I listen to the playlists when I am at work and have been finding that there are times where I am liking the music so much I want to like or give some sort of feedback live. I have been using Periscope a lot lately and have been the digging the ability to tap little hearts during the live broadcasts. That would be pretty cool to do when I am listening to Amazon Prime music and you could get more feedback on how people are liking the jams.Keep up the good stuff!

I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit. Then came the support merry-go-round.

For me, this is a shame because my phone and iPad are not hooked up to my home stereo, while the Roku device is.

And , as mentioned before, I would really like to search for music via my fire tv box, and listen to it on my TV / sound system in my living room.

UNKNOWN HINSON is the KING of Country and Western Troubadors doubt it? Google it!. How can they even have country music on here and not include the King?! I am sure other artists are missing as well, but it is imperative to include Unknown! Squeaking by on Hank III, even though the edited versions of his songs come up first. It is cool that censored and uncensored versions are available... As a parent, I like that. Battery usage seems comparable to Pandora. No ads yay! Just started using this today... So far pretty good.

12306,"Amazon",2014-12-01,2,"Like the service, Android App rather disappointing Like the prime service over all, but rather disappointed in not being able to store music on the SD Card. Really have trouble believing that this use case was not brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common. I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card world readable, 777 all that is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music I am guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there. All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method will not last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see what is on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."

We have a fairly fast network, >6Mbps, and while playing music at home in the evenings the music plays, stops, plays, stops, ...etc. During this time we tested the network and all other streaming apps and everything looked and worked perfect.Nothing else was running on our network except Amazon Prime Music. To stream music takes very little bandwidth compared to streaming an HD Movie. This normally means a home network for playing music is rarely the problem and more likely to be something overloaded/broken in the providers network."

Having 1,000,000 songs available must mean you have to buy the other 100,000,000. I signed up for Amazon Prime because of the value added content of prime music, prime video, and prime books, one of which i can not even access and the other two of which add negligable value. I am not renewing my prime membership you will have to call to do this as the day you can, buy there is nowhere to do this on there site. Either that or they have it buried in a dark, inconspicuous corner of their site.Prediction... Prime is the beginning of the decline for Amazon.

I had to search for it again then find that it was already in my mp3 basket but I couldnt get to my mp3 basket!!!!! Wasted an age on this........wait it continues.Then when I have bought it I try to download it to my computer and after updating a particular internet explorer it then tells me I need to down load amazon mp3 downloader, which I have but needs updating!!!!! So I update this then it after all that it no longer seems to let me download the song and I cant get it to come up on my newly updated amazon mp3 downloader!!!!

I have been able to load some of my old music to my library and plan to add more. The selection is always growing. You can download the music to the device so you can play it when offline as well. I had no problem with the app on my Kindle Fire as others have reported. It is true the music from prime is only able to be played in the prime player but that has never been an issue for me.

I also wish that when I look at the artist that there would be the entire discography not just a couple albums . I find the selection of music inadequate . When compared to Spotify Amazon prime music has a much inferior selection. I constantly have issues in which I cannot find a particular song, album, and/or artist I am looking for. Then to make it even worse many times when I am looking for a particular song I find obnoxious remixes and covers that I want no part of."

Amazon music however, though is still relatively new lacks in up to date music, searching for popular music tends to yield no results which is slightly baffling. For this app to do well it needs to be able to take on its competitors and sadly does not quite do that. The app its self works lovely but without a good sizeable content library what is the point?"

I have a 64gb card installed because I use my phone often more than my laptop. So I can nibble away at my data plan when not near a Wi-Fi or not bother with this system.

Then you have to restart and deal with all the duplicates from the first attempt. If I can not get my thousands of tracks uploaded, this will be of little use to me. The only reason I bought the space in the cloud was so that my new Amazon Echo which works MUCH better could access most of my music collection.

Not to mention the amount of memory my music takes up. It just frustrates me to no end.

I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large percent of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I do not need to force close, Amazon? For the record I only ever listed to music that was local to my device. Never streamed music."

There is not a lot of choice of music-especially for those who prefer niche artists rather than main stream pop.

I bought Amazon Prime specifically for deliveries of Amazon purchases and have given Amazon Music a chance. But Ive now resubscribed to Deezer."

I never was too pleased with iTunes, this is a bit better IMHO.I have about 7,600 songs in my library. I have downloaded about half to my phone. When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs. This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application. For example - if you are playing a song, you can not add it to a playlist from that point."

If it has to do with piracy then you should know that anyone who wants to illegally download content can do it with ease and by not enabling your store on the international stage you are only hurting yourselves. If you considered making purchases available in other countries you would be making alot more money in those markets than you are now nothing. Guess I will stick to buying from Itunes."

12472,"Amazon",2012-10-04,4,"Very Good, But Room For Improvement I am a big fan of this app, but it still has some shortcomings that just drive me up the walls:1. Sorting. The Beatles should not be sorted under the letter T. The sorting works fine in the iOS version, but for some reason, on Android, it is a mess.2. When opening the app, it should default to Artists not albums. it is logical for people to think, oh, I feel like listening to artist rather than thinking of an album first. it is one extra click, but it is a fairly obvious thing. And this is something that only recently changed, it used to work just fine.3. Random songs on my cloud drive just will not appear on the mobile app. Haven't figured out what causes this to happen. Sometimes deleting and re-uploading the track works, other times the missing song might just randomly reappear. Whatever causes this needs to be resolved.4. User's should be allowed to shut off Upgraded Audio. Great, so I rip my MP3's at 256 to 320kbps VBR using the LAME MP3 encoder, and Amazon tells me that they are upgrading my audio to 256kpbs? Last I checked, 256kbps was of a lower quality than 320kpbs.5. Could use an editable EQ. Currently it has presets you can cycle through, but I would like the ability to edit the EQ settings myself."

Calling it a resource hog is polite. My Galaxy S4 with 16GB of internal and 32GB of external was no match. If you have any kind of a music library say goodbye to your internal memory. I love the prime music but it is worthless when you can not use it. Amazon does so many things well...whoever approved this app can not be much of a music lover.....or they are a former iTunes programmer. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it would almost be easier to rip music and use media player. Very frustratied and disappointed."

Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can not even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I am usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but...

I still use Amazon Music for MP3 because there is nothing better, but for now I will just manually copy the MP3s to my phone and use Google Play Music app to play the songs while I am jogging.Dear Amazon: until you change the behavior of this application back to where it is not violating our privacy, I am not using your app. Fix that, and I will reinstall it."

Signing up on your computer was just a method for driving hits to the site for popularity. Problem was that it was not intuitive in navigation and therefore irksome. The app looks fine, feels fine, but overall is veneer over cheap wood. it is a bit clunky and goes for jukebox vintagey feel over function. The app got locked up on trying to upload my music from my ipad. No option to bypass, only sit there and wait. Felt like a Microsoft product at Walmart. I have purchased music and films at Amazon, but no cross-refencing to create suggestions or no ability for you to read a spotify playlist or even take a suggestion from the getgo. This is clearly a rush job by an asynchronous team who had to take a shelved product to market after it finally passed through legal or something that held it up.So its available, but not fun to use. Perhaps it will be fixed, but for now, luckily, there are other apps that sing and play. This one will have to stay in from recess."

12500,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update. Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted."

I was not eligible to get a smart phone until Oct 2010. It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive. Just go get on amazon...sweet! However, I wanted one of those smart phones. I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed. However, waiting gets the best of us. I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet. I thought the 7 display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you. And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT. It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I did not. This way I get what I wanted android stuff and I did not have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I am in the middle of dishes and I can not get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it is available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier. I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems. No searching this folder or that. I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I did not like was that for some reason I can not figure out how to not download a whole album...but that does not take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player happy If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak winking"

I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and then re-installed the app, and done everything else I could think of and nothing has helped. It stays at the log in screen. I input my email and password and it either crashes or tells me I have input the wrong info.

I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP. Ugghhhh...... Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

This is beyond a doubt the most complex and difficult to use update amazon has ever come up with. Whoever thought this up should be fired! Difficult to navigate, complex beyond words, this new version makes moving music between programs nearly impossible. I truly hate what you have done. I will no longer purchase my music from amazon. Truly deplorable"
12523,"Amazon",2015-02-02,5,"Music, music, everywhere! I am really thrilled with Amazon Music. I started with the app for PC so I could enjoy my Amazon Prime Music benefits on my computer, but then added Amazon Music to my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire. I am really sold on this, and here's why:Being a Prime member, I can add a wide variety of music to my cloud storage for free, which is exactly what I did. Hundreds of songs - FREE! Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I have purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I have purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I have not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I am not sure it is possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use. To be honest, I thought it was really straightforward and easy to use. One complaint that I saw says you can not use your newly-purchased music unless you download everything again... I bought some new music yesterday and I downloaded just the new music. It was very simple to figure out and download. Perhaps the complainers had an older version of the app?If you are a Prime member and love music, I think you will like this app. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
12524,"Amazon",2015-09-08,5,"Love prime music Love prime music, have it on every device and it works wonderfully. Ironically, I can not get on in my kindle, so I will probably buy a regular android tablet next so I can actually use this app on my tablet instead of having to use phone or computer."
12539,"Amazon",2012-12-12,1,"Would be great, but for non-configurable storage location Only one star as there is currently no way to configure where the app stores downloaded music. On my Samsung Galaxy S3 it ends up on the internal sdcard, taking up valuable storage space required for apps. So after downloading the music using the app, I have to manually copy the files to my external 64GB sdcard. Talk about usability... To me this makes the whole player as such a waste of time.What point is an integrated player/downloader if an additional manual step is required every time I want to store the music locally? The cloud feature is great when listening on the desktop but with the phone I often listen to music when there is no stable or only a very slow internet connection e.g. when on a plane or long-distance train.So only one instead of 4 or 5 stars, as the software as such is not usable right now. Just download the files via the desktop, copy them over to the phone's external sdcard and use the built-in mp3 player. Much better user experience and less hassle!"

12544,"Amazon",2012-12-30,4,"My choice from the three contenders Choosing the right cloud solution for my music collection was a journey of trial and error. The complication arose out of my cross platform use. I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go. If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store. I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device. The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.

VERY STUPID and QUITE LIKE THE TAIL END OF A DONKEY, is my answer.Then, when you move the files, if they are sunc from the cloud, it wants to start putting them back and pretty soon the phones are crashing again for lack of internal memory.

To top if off 2 of the last three downloads that are on the cloud and with help from amazon are on my computer. One of the songs was upcut and the other had so many pops and clicks in it I deemed it worthless.

Why bother. I try to email the report and get a message back that the mailbox is full. I do not want to stream music during my commute. I just want to listen to my off-cloud downloaded music.

Trying to use this app in my car dock is an accident waiting to happen.Speaking of crashes... If you like crashes, this is the app for you! I find that it usually crashes after playing a single song.

I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download itpurchase it with credit and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. 4 stars all the way,would have given it 5 if it was compatible with my tablet.

12601,"Amazon",2011-08-06,4,"Excellent, but not ideal yet The concept of this cloud player has some wonderful benefits -- same library of content available to all your devices, regardless of where you are. The fact that Amazon's library is based on the open MP3 format instead of any DRM format also makes it much more robust and useful. This is the first serious competition to Apple's iTunes without most of the headaches associated with that platform. However, there are some issues that should be addressed to make this a more robust player:1 The ability to d/l a playlist to your device without downloading the space-consuming songs in that playlist.2 The ability to shuffle the songs in a playlist. Google Music can do this, and it is one of the few things it can do that Amazon Cloud Player can not. This should be a simple s/w fix.3 When you display the list of all songs, it would be nice to see what playlist each song belongs to, if any. it is a chore to search your entire library to find any orphaned songs.There are other features that I could request to make this a dream app, but these features alone would make it much closer to ideal for me. Add these features, and I would give it a full 5 stars."
12603,"Amazon",2011-04-04,4,"A solid first effort Out of nowhere Amazon has a very compelling Android music player. Streaming works great and I did not have any of the hiccups that I nearly always had with Rdio, MOG, Rhapsody, and Audiogalaxy, even on 3G. I think it even autobuffers the next song, which the above apps all failed to do, despite claiming it as a feature.There are a few features that would make it way cooler, though:1. Unify cloud music and device music. This could be replaced by a simple icon for one or the other, and would make it easier to see what you had on each, without flipping back and forth.2. Be able to access your wishlist/shopping lists from the app. Buying music and having it available instantly in cloud player is awesome, but it is a pain to have to go to Amazon.com to pick up the albums that I have already saved in my lists.3. Fix the uploader application for Windows. If you do not use iTunes or WMP, it has to crawl your hard drive and those results are organized by folder rather than tag, and on-drive folder structure is not preserved, which makes it excessively difficult to upload all albums by a given artist."
12606,"Amazon",2017-10-05,1,"It keeps on running and running and running... There is no way to stop the app. It just keeps on starting again even if you close it. Reason enough for me to cancel my subscription. Fix this!"

12609,"Amazon",2015-07-14,4,"I like it. I think Amazon Music is great as it is included with Prime Membership. There are so many free songs you can download, especially the old rock classics. I do find the format difficult to navigate which gets frustrating. I wish you could download to the cloud and your device at the same time. I hate having to download the song to the cloud and then download it to my device also. Especially if I am downloading lots of songs. It takes sooooo long. Once, all of my songs disappeared from my Kindle and I had to download all of them again. Not fun. Since it is included with my Prime membership, I really can not complain too much."

It will not let you download to your SD card, the whole app is clunky, etc. On the whole I do not use it much.Recently I hit my data limit. This usually is not a problem for me. So I checked my data history and surprise, surprise, Amazon Music decided it needed to do something so critical that it used about half of my data plan in the course of one day 465Mb?!. I actually need that data to do other things, like GPS navigate.No thanks. I have disabled the app. There are much better ways to get music onto my phone"

Example is Blue Oyster Cult's TAKE ME AWAY. All the time, is it the MP3 from the store??"

At last count, I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for - even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them. Maybe I am missing it, but I see it if I listen on my laptop but not on my phone."

There was over 50 different album arts downloaded, most of which I never purchased and some was offensive. I do not know if this was a fluke or not but the way to see is plug your phone into your computer, make sure the USB connect is on Disc Drive on your phone open up either drive E or F and look in amazon.mp3 and then look in a folder called image.pics or something similar, and look at all the .jpeg files you can safely delete the .jpeg files without screwing you phone/computer up.I like Amazon as a whole, but this in not right and we as buyers should be able to decide what we want on our devices, not someone else.This would be the perfect music player, except for this one flaw, so one star as I did not download any music with offensive album art.As always, with ANYTHING on a hard drive or something similar , do this at your own risk, I am not responsible if you screw your devices up."

So, the small MP3 player I just purchased on the Amazon website to use while I am running, the MP3 player that just plays music files and does not load apps, the MP3 player that I will now be returning to Amazon, is totally useless. They should show this information in big bold letters from the get go instead of leading you to believe that you can download music onto your PC. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY PRIME MUSIC FILES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER. So, really not sure why they are calling these songs you can not download Prime music , certainly makes it seem as though you as a Prime member would have access is a bunch of crap. I guess they are trying to justify the dollar 99.00 a year fee they charge by giving you what amounts to another Pandora or Spotify. What a waste of time, and now I have an app I have to uninstall as well or maybe I should just run with my Kindle strapped to the side of my head."

Other than that I enjoy the app. it is simple to use and I like having my music library handy wherever I may be.UPDATE: I have recently moved the app from my SD card back to the phone. There is a limitation to the Android operation system that does not allow widgets if it is on your SD card. After doing this I was able to use the widget once again. I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have. Lately I have been creating playlists in Amazon and then using the cubed 3 player to play them as the sound is better through that player.Using Droid Incredible 2."

Yeah it was my fault for clicking to download my queue 3 times while trouble shooting, but no choice to stop downloading, or remove songs. SUCKTASTIC, MORONIC, SIMPLISTIC, GARBAGE!

Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing challenging as that might be to represent.This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I would love to see two additions:1/ integration with the lock screen ala Songbird2/ Support for the scrobbling standards e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers.Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I could not see how best to add enhancement requests directly."

Start driving and blasting tunes. iPod goes to autolock, player quits. does not do this with iTunes player. No way in settings to keep playing when in sleep mode. So to keep music playing, I have to constantly fiddle with my iPod. But, I can not put it to the home screen, or it stops playing. I like to listen while working, but will not ever be able to listen to Amazon music cause the MP3 player is CRAP! CRAP CRAP CRAP! Worthless for a player that quits when the device screen goes dark.

I think most customers want the original music that made the charts. Here, remakes seem to rule. Oh I get it, the originals are mostly not free. it is often hard to weed out the inferior remakes by listening to one short sample. You can get caught with a bunch of lousy remakes you bought without knowing. Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they are not close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that is why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: do not bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I did not want. do not know why, but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that were not even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all..

Metal!My only complaint is that the cloud storage for my personal library is limited, only allowing me to get a fraction of my own music collection uploaded.

12904,"Amazon",2013-05-11,1,"So much for having to quit buying CD's I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I do not! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?"

I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I do not mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great. That said, until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player, I will not have much use for it.

Somehow, Amazon made a mobile app that is worse than the stupid desktop mp3 downloader.I still can not fathom why every company that sells music needs to have their own stupid player. I guess their marketing folks are happy to lose users just to get more stalking info and push their products harder."
13038,"Amazon",2016-08-27,5,"My Music Where and When I Want It I like the many choices that Prime Music gives me.

The only critiques I have are that the app needs to include a Current list of top 50 for each category, in addition to aggregating compilation albums so they are listed as a single album after downloading instead of around 15 separate albums. Makes it kind of annoying when I want to listen to a soundtrack, and have to create a playlist to do so because the songs are not grouped together under one album."

I bought my first Amazon album to get the free dollar 20 worth of storage space and started to upload all of my music to the Cloud. Be patient. It takes a long time about 4 days, for me to upload my songs.The app works just fine. It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists. The store portion is easy as well. It even shows the free song of the day! I haven't had any problems with playback, either. My only suggestion to make this better is to have several widget options. I want one that is full screen and displays the album art of the current song."

The player is playing, as it shows the track progressing, but no sound is produced.

13778,"Amazon",2011-03-31,3,"UPDATE: FIXED was A music player that can not play music. Seriously? UPDATE - ATTENTION EVO 4G USERS: It turns out after much online research today that the issues I was experiencing were unique to the HTC Evo 4G, and were the result of a software update that had been pushed out to Evo users earlier this year. Apparently this update had changed HTTP and RTSP streaming settings/configuration in a way that affected certain apps--in this case it rendered the Amazon cloud player completely useless.Interestingly, Pandora was somehow never affected by it, and so I hadn't noticed the problem until now. Go figure.Anyway, the issue can easily be resolved by contacting Sprint Technical Support 1-888-211-4727 and asking the rep to apply the work around listed as 'HTC EVO 4G A9292 - UPDATED 2-1-2011: Streaming multimedia applications receiving errors on software version 3.70.651.1' in Sprint's device portal. I did this, and when I finally got to a tech support rep, he immediately knew what I was talking about, pushed an over-the-air fix, and 5 minutes later I was streaming from the Amazon mp3 cloud over 3G without any issues at all.It works perfectly now. Sweet. I am upgrading my rating from 1 star when I really meant 0 to 3 stars.---- previous review -----:This review is specific to the new cloud player functionality of the app. Two words: utterly useless. I would honestly give it 0 stars if I could.I am on an HTC Evo Android 2.2. Regardless of my connection--WiFi, 4G, 3G--I continually get the same Network Error when trying to play anything at all in the app. It just does not work. All other network-dependent apps on my device are working perfectly fine, while the Amazon MP3 player fails.I would not even consider this alpha-quality software. Did this thing even go through QA at all?"

13903,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-23,5,"best radio app ever do not listen to the people that say u need a Facebook account cause u do not. All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones u make. Definitely worth downloading happy"

The sound quality is good and continues to play with minimal buffering problems. Only really issue I have, and this could be with the channel I listen to, is that it seem there are about three or four commercials that are played every break. So when listening to a three hours game this can be a little annoying toward the end."

I must have dead zones in my neighborhood because it always dies in the same locations.I really wish it worked because I would listen every day - not allowed to stream at work and cannot get AM radio reception in my office building."
13929,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-23,4,"Great radio app. I did not have to log in with Facebook. This is a fantastic radio app. It has lots of artists. I intentionally searched for obscure entertainers and found them. While it does have a filter for explicit content, it is an all or nothing approach. The ads are not as obtrusive as they are on other apps. And this has a quick load time."

14158,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-07,5,"I love the selection... I have this set on some of my favorite genres so that every time I open it, it goes right to the last station I was listening to. Be aware that if the station has advertising, you will be listening to it, too. It is only remotely similar to Pandora, which is where you create your own stations. That may be a possibility on this app. But for now, I enjoy the stations I have chosen and saved. Enjoy!"

It has A lot of music that I enjoy which is Smooth Jazz with little or no singing with each song that they play. Tried to purchase this music at stores and its almost impossible to find. So I just turn on my computer and I have all the music I like at the click of my mouse."

It plays one or two songs of hers first, then it plays the songs she listens to. It is great for iPhones or Ipod Touches, when jogging, shopping, or even at the gym. I would prefer this app a lot more then Pandora or WorldWide Radio."
14236,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-27,1,"1 stars! Worst app ever. I only put up with this stupid app because I do not have any other music. It stops and exits your songs and does not always work. If you value your music like me, just buy it. it is not worth it to sit around trying to make this stupid app work."
14238,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-04,5,"why cry? what is everyone crying about? I downloaded it for my kindle fire and it works great! Also I need to point out that you do NOT need facebook to sign up or in. It is an option ONLY! Seriously people do not choose not to download something simply cuz others were not satisfied and could not figure things out for themselves. If you do not have or want to have a facebook account then just create your own iheartradio login. It gives you the option for either or."
14239,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-26,2,"Not pleased with their choices I don' t like the limited skips. Why limit my choices for what you want to hear. iHeart sucks on there choices of songs for your created station...to avoid skips Pandora allows you to make a list of artist that you want to hear on your created stations and makes there suggestions also...so I find myself using Pandora."
14244,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-19,4,"Great!!! So fun to be able to hear fav stations from other places.One of the hard things about moving is losing some of thefavorite things that one loved about that place.

So far it sounds very good and once I gain more confidence in using the features my rating could change. It does use more battery power than I expected but to have a good product there has to be sacrifices. Thank you."

You can listen to local area stations for whatever genre you enjoy, or one of the 800 other stations in the US. There are preset stations, my two favs are Today's Mix and Smooth Jazz, or you can create your own station. Just plug in an artist or song, and the program will find you music in that genre.

18503,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-26,1,"iHeart Spy-o You have to wonder what really is behind this app. It delivers music, of course, and advertisements. But why on earth does this need to know where you are within a 5' radius? It can easily determine which ads you should receive and which stations you are allowed to listen to by using COARSE location data. It does not need GPS precision for anything other than to sell that information to whomever is interested in buying it.It runs at startup, running constantly in the background tracking your every movement even if you are not listening to it. Why?Plus, it gets your list of accounts on your device. All of them. Does Clear Channel need to know about all of your accounts on your Android? If so, for what reasons?it is sickening what this app does, for no apparent reason other than to sell your personal, confidential accounts and location information."

19333,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-17,4,"Good Clean Reception I was looking for an app that could deliver streamed radio from various locations. I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type. I have found stations through the internet on my home computer, but was not able to enjoy it at work. Enter iHeart. At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem. Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference. The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I do not mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is when I am traveling, the buffer is not large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you are driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."

22238,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-26,4,"Useful app, but wish it was more attuned to feedback. I love using iHeartRadio on my Kindle to listen to music while I am in the shower or doing chores around the house. it is nice to be able to listen to my local radio stations and I also enjoy the create your own station feature. it is cool to be able to hear music I like with the element of surprise you get from radio because you do not know what is coming on next. All with very few commercials.What I do not like is that the create your own station feature is not as attuned to feedback as it leads you to believe. When you skip or thumbs down an artist multiple times, on some stations you never hear that artist again, but on others you will hear the artist again in a few minutes, and every time you listen to that station."

25243,"iHeartRadio",2012-01-02,5,"I love this! Country music without having to buy it. I have this app running 24/7 and I have all my friends hooked."
25244,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-12,3,"Better than... Pandora. At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition. While it is great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you would not hear the same stuff within the first half-hour. Overall? it is a keeper for me for now. BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes or at all unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I am all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can not find a genre to suit your mood, you are just not looking."
25247,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-19,4,"good but not great I love everything about Iheart but l like to listen to the whole song before I like or dislike the song. Iheart thinks that people like me do not exist so you can not go back to the song you just listened to and like or dislike it. You have to wait for the song to come up again or pray it does not and never have to hear it again. If you do not like or dislike Iheart thinks you liked it or something like that, but everything else is perfect. I would not change anything else about it if you like music, radio, or lyrics strung along in a catchy tone this is the app for you."
25250,"iHeartRadio",2012-01-05,5,"Excellent App Much better than I had thought it is be. I love this app and it replaces Pandora by a long shot!"

25260,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-22,2,"way better then a mp player I can enter a song from when in high school and find it mostly. My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music."
25268,"iHeartRadio",2016-09-26,1,"Barely Working It often has a lot of trouble connecting to streams. For example, only 2 of my local stations will even connect. All of them did at first, then they stopped. I contacted the developer and they told me this was a known problem I am using a Kindle Fire 7 5th generation and will be fixed in a future update. They haven't done so yet...."

My kindle will not download the player from Air1 which made me panic cause I was needing my Christian music. A couple other players that I tried was not near as user friendly. Love that I found it on amazon so I can now do more multi-tasking. happy"
25274,"iHeartRadio",2015-09-17,1,"I would like to delete or remove it and restart even though iheart radio is on my kindle I cannot open it. it is asking for something I do not know what it is. Something of a number or something else. I would like to delete or remove it and restart, but it does not even have delete, remove, or some other button for that. Very Disappointed. And I wanted to listen to my radio program. Oh well."
25285,"iHeartRadio",2017-05-10,2,"Would not connect half the time Selected stations outside of my market area and it just sat there and spun, but did not connect. I will try again, but Amazon music is better."
25286,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-11,1,"I no longer like this app. It worked for awhile but now when the talk shows I listen to go to a commercial iheart takes over with ENDLESS music and ads causing me to miss my desired sho with program. I end up stopping iheart, restarting it again so I can listen to my programs plural until it goes to a break and iheart takes over again with ENDLESS ads and music. I am searching for a replacement app."
25288,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,5,"So much better then Pandora. Its so much better then Pandora cause it gets what you want to listen to.It pays attention to the music you like.In Pandora you give a song a thumbs down but it plays the same song or artist over and over again.iHeartRadio gives you more variety to most familiar to least familiar.its awesome.When this review says Bree Fontinilla that is my mum.I am her daughter writing this review.Zoe Kemp.Also known as Zoe Horan - Styles.Youtube channel- ZoeHoran1213.Plez subscribe to me.I haven't made any videos yet."

25295,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-29,4,"4.5 out of 5 stars for iHeart Radio Overall a good app. it is got good songs and bands and is good if you like certain bands but do not want to actually buy the CD. The only complaint I have is that you have a moment ad to how many songs you can skip in a playlist a day. Also you can not add individual songs to your playlist. But a good app. I enjoy it."
25302,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-21,4,"Really like this for my Kindle This is terrific! So many choices from all over the country. there is something for everyone's listening pleasure! do not hesitate with this one."
25304,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-01,2,"Still needs bug fixes they are trying to patch it. Still get random IHeart Radio is not working error messages even when the app is off. Lots of interruptions in streaming but may be due to slow wifi where I use it. It use to work much better before they improved it."
25305,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-01,1,"Unhappy and I am annoyed Right after I downloaded it I deleted it because it skipped and you have to have an Internet connection to listen. I had heard that it was a good app but it is not worth getting. I also had a hard time using the app. I would much rather continue using Pandora and VeVo like I usually do. I reccomend that you do not get this app."
25306,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-26,2,"Just was not For Me I thought I could like this app but just could not take the time too. Some people might think its awesome and that is okay."
25308,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-11,2,"not hearting it! After using only 4 thumbs down options I was cut off from making any other song choices other than being allowed to skip to next song. It also took some time to load today. I waited 7 minutes, retried and then finally gave up. I loved it when it was working, but got really frustrated with the rest. I will keep at and see if I can not find harmony with it somehow!"
25309,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-24,1,"SUCKS They upgraded iHeartRadio and it sucks! The new version is worse than the old version. They should have just stuck with the old version. The new one always pauses, then says the application is not responding then asks you to force close the application. But whatever, I am not telling you what to do. Choice is yours."
25311,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-25,5,"KFI on iHeart Radio! I use this app to listen to my fave radio show, streaming which I cannot get in my area any other way"

25638,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,4,"Four Stars: Please read information below Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there is no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it will automatically choose songs or stations to play next. it will also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can not like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can not save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist. This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you do not like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that is the truth. I am here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...there is nothing really to expose."

This is a must-have app if you want to listen to a Cumulus Media station on your device.However, this app does not stream international radio I use TuneIn for that on my device."
25743,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-16,5,"iHeartRadio - Free music and Internet Radio I chose this rating because I love to listen to various types of music! I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet. I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day. I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription. I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it. The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc. Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music and Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire! I would highly recommend this App to family, friends, and acquaintances! I hope my recommendation will entice anyone who reads it to try it out."

Has streaming problems This iheart radio app is amazing, has most of the station's on the air I enjoy, has other radios and settings, and just like Pandora as you can choose any genre or artist, or create you are own station. The only problem that I had is the streaming is sometimes temporarily off, but other than that, I heart iheart radio!!!!!"
25757,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-22,5,"Super Solid Internet Radio App, Clear Cut Privacy Policy What a honest, neat app! First, a quick treatment concerning the permissions. I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy, and everything is upfront and optable. ClearChannel only shares information with 3rd Parties in two cases: a delegation directly involved in providing app services b when the user *voluntary* opt-ins for marketing none of that you automatically agreed to get marketed guff. When I initially looked at the social circle registration, I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications. The email address registration is the most private method of registration. All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in-app adverts; however, they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming, nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing. These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you X out of them. Otherwise, for a freebie radio with custom channels, this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design, I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad, confusing, advertising riddled interfaces. iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI. I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what, but in about 6 minutes I had my custom Beatles channel made and audio commercial-free streaming. Sweet! I especially love the mix selector. Double Sweet! On top of everything, a moderately low RAM footprint approx 46mbs during streaming, less than my Chrome Browser. This app gets 5 solid stars and a Woot!*Addendum: As of 20Jun14, apparently a recent update has done away with the intermittent static adverts and replaced them with a single streaming advert at the beginning, in this case a T Mobile commercial. can not exit out of it, but it is rather short and bearable for a free radio service.*"
25759,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-27,3,"Great app until you realize it only plays a handful of songs on repeat... At first, I got this app and absolutely loved it! It was the greatest thing I had ever seen, and I loved that it was completely ad free... notice how that is past tense. After listening to it for a few weeks, I began to realize I was hearing the same song over... and over... and over....... and over, again. There is very little variety on this app. That being said, it is free and it will stream non-stop until you turn it off unlike the free version of Pandora, which turns itself off when it decides you are no longer listening. My wife uses this app to keep music playing in my sons room while he sleeps, through the night. Unfortunately, it too will shut of, unexpectedly, which creates a silence that almost always wakes him up. This can get annoying when it is 2 in the morning and I have to get up in an hour and a half. All of that being said, it is free. You can not expect to get things for free and them to be as good as something you pay for, all I ask is they put a litttllleee more time and effort into this app."

25777,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-29,4,"Better than local; will never equal the past. It is 100 percent better than any radio station out there today; that being said, it does not come close to the stations, and the independent format of decades ago. How many remember the King Biscuit Flower Hour ? There are literately millions of albums and singles out there which are never played; although not a top 40 format, they do repeat the same song within a few hours. I remember well the great independent format of the late 60's and early 70's WQSR 102.5 Sarasota FL; its call letters were Quad 102 1/2, in today's market everything pre-recorded on a disk, I doubt if ever we will see or I should say hear real music format again."
25778,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-18,3,"It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work I picked this becuz I could not get Pandora to work on my phone while I was at work. The only problem is the selections. This program does not have that wide a selection which you choose a station. Say you choose Katy Perry. they will also play Selena Gomez, Demi Levato, and Ariana Grande. Unfortunately I can think of several others that should come up becuz I ahve the same station on Pandora and they dont. I could of course just pick a different station but finding something that would suit all my needs is a pain and you can not combine stations or I would have. It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work lol"
25780,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-16,4,"overall good app Pretty good app, lots of radio stations to choose from. Unlike what others said, you do NOT need a facebook account to use this maybe this was the case in the past, but not aymore. I signed up just using my email, which I did not mind.My only issue with this app is that it can crash sometimes on my Kindle Fire when trying to open it. Other than that, it works great. Other good radio apps are Pandora and TuneIn Radio live stations."
25784,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-26,5,"Hello iHeartRadio, good-bye KFLD talk radio! This app turned out to be a blessing. My home town Talk Radio station, out of the blue, dropped the Sean Hannity radio program from their line-up. My calls to their office go unanswered. It made me question their motives. So I looked on the internet and found iHeart Radio. I am 60 years old and this app is very user friendly, I have no trouble with it. I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio, in New York City, of all places I live in WA State, I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle, or my computer and even on my Windows phone. Love this app. So for me its Hello iHeart Radio, good-bye KFLD talk radio."
25798,"iHeartRadio",2016-02-22,5,"The PROs and PRO CONsss.... The pros: I liked the fact that I did not have to tell it each hour that I was listening to it. The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me. I would recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them. Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON. LOL."
25801,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-18,5,"If you love Radio then you will love this app Its about the only radio over web app you want to use if you are regular radio listener, or if you are niche listener like the music or talk radio.The Iheartradio is the tablet app that is finall available for the Kindle Fire that allows users listen to an variety of music radio, music channels dedicated to particular genres, talk programs, and some television station audio.Its an alright app. I would becareful about using this app if you have a limited data plan. Not that it takes up alot of data or bandwidth but its so simple to loose track of how much you are downloading."
25802,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-24,5,"I really appreciate how easy it is! I enjoy listening to music any time but I find it makes cleaning and most other things such as wrapping presents as I am working on now seem to go that much smoother and faster! I particularly enjoy using this app because I can just choose a station that fits whichever chore I am working on or musical mood I am in and I can listen wherever I am without worrying whether the station will tune in well or have static as I often experienced and was frustrated by with any alarm clock or other type of standard radio receivers! I have this app installed on my kindle fire HD as well as on my smartphone and I regularly use both! Also, I love that you are able to log in either through your Facebook account or, if you are like me and do not care to share your listening preferences with all your friends my preferences vary so extremely that I would probably come across as having a multiple personality, through your email. Finally, I love that the commercial breaks are not overwhelming...from what I recall I would say that the commercial breaks are comparable to a standard radio station such as what I used to listen to before this app!"
25812,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-28,4,"I heart dollar at number ¥¿£ Only the best app ever!!! If you do not mind interruptions due to interrupted digital signals. Weather it is the apps one uses, or if there in no proper signals which is frustrating digital! Got to love it!. It still is an awesome app because it has the best stations to choose from and of course setting up your own stations and being able to purchase music you like. It may never be a 5 star app for me until it can get a clean signal that stays clean for longer than 30 minutes. It always fails when your listening to something interesting conspiracy much!!!. But it is probably my fault for its failure to totally satisfy me. Still it is worth the download."

It uses the device's wireless to connect to the radio stations you love so you have to be connected to the internet or some sort of public wireless system for it to work. I found it enjoyable to use - you can choose radio stations near you or ones from where you are from if you are traveling. It lists the artist and song title during each song so you know what is playing. I found it does drain the battery considerably with prolonged use an hour or so but it is not much different than similar apps so you may want to keep it plugged in if you are going to listen to it for a while.What I did like is the ability to listen to new music and to learn who the new up and coming artists were. Again, very convenient way to listen to music and know who you are listening to."
25841,"iHeartRadio",2017-05-24,4,"I am glad that I have it I am glad that I have it. It allows me to find radio stations more suited to my needs and tastes. I also like that the audio quality is beyond comparison with what I get out of my radio, so the listening pleasure is greatly improved. My only criticism is that I wish the station categories were more discrete; that I could more easily distinguish a Christian music station from one that was more focused on the fundamentals of scripture and prayer or news and socio-political commentary from a Christian point of view."
25842,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-22,5,"Best Radio app by far I love this app! I have told my friends and family...even strangers how Great it is. My husband, our kids and some of their friends have installed it and it has ran Rly good, even on their Apple iPhones. Pandora plays too many ads, not enough music. I hardly hear ads on iHeart. ONLY my brother had yet to get it, but that is due to iheart not having 93.3 The Planet, Greenville SC. The next best is AccuRadio, which I have on my Kobo Vox ereader since this app will not install. I am sure if iHeart would add 93.3 they would get more consumers. A LOT of ppl love The Rise Guys."
25845,"iHeartRadio",2017-09-27,2,"Unreliable IHeart Radio app is unreliable. It only play's my favorite stations 30 percent of the time and right now it is not working at all."
25847,"iHeartRadio",2017-05-13,5,"iHeartRadio is a great way to listen to your favorite radio stations! iHeartRadio makes listening to my favorite stations much more enjoyable, both local stations I used to listen to over the airand distant stations that are only available through apps like this. The only disappointment was that a few of the stations Itried to access were unavailable, but I assume some additional stations will be added in the future."
25850,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-03,4,"Very Nice App I really like your ability to choose similar artists and listen to those. You are not listening to, only, one artist; yet, you have variety."
25851,"iHeartRadio",2017-05-26,1,"iheart radio - An amazing example of Crappy Technology I pretty much hate this app. These are the on going problems that I experience on a daily basis.1 If will just shut off for no reason regardless of network type.2 Often you cannot get it to restart for a while after it stops. Often when it goes down it does not come back for hours3 It will randomly restart even after you have closed the app, which can be very frustrating and embarrassing when in important meetings or at dinner.4 Sometimes only commercials play right through the radio programming causing you to miss the entire talk radio broadcast.5 There is nobody to report problems to so they never get fixed.6 The radio station that I listen too is at their mercy as complaining to them is fruitless.7 You spend more time trying to fix it, deisntall it,reinstall it, that you miss your scheduled programming.7 Bottom line, this app has received the official Crappy Technology award and I now use a cheap, and extremely reliable, AM transistor radio for my talk radio pleasure. It is reliable and never fails. number Iheartradiosucks number kfyicrappytechnology number iheartradiocrappytechnology"
25852,"iHeartRadio",2013-04-03,5,"Great app! I love that I can listen to all of my favorite local radio stations from just about anywhere. could not ask for much more."

25866,"iHeartRadio",2016-04-03,5,"great for listening to your favorite radio station no matter where you are With IHeartRadio you can listen to actual radio stations on you phone. This is great if you move out of state and miss listening to your favorite morning shows. It is also great if you live out in the boonies and do not get regular radio stations. I heart radio also has stations for your mood. whether you want sad, happy, or workout music i heart radio has a station for you. This app also has Pod casts you can listen too."

25871,"iHeartRadio",2013-04-17,5,"This is a great app I haven't explored all the bells and whistles yet with this app, but so far I am impressed. I got this for my Kindle fire for picking up local stations that sometimes get interferred with by stations coming in from CanadaI live on the North Coast and my stations come in crystal clear. It is pretty easy to use too. All you need to do is pick your home stateor any other state for that matter and a city and boom, your listening to that station in real time just like it is in your own backyard. There is also an option to make your own station by picking only the music that interests you. That feature I have yet to explore in its entirety, but when I do, I will perhaps come back and edit this review. Until then, get this app and enjoy your music! And, one more thing: it is FREE! you would be denying yourself if you do not at least give it a try. If you do not like it, delete it. Happy Listening from the North Coast!"
25876,"iHeartRadio",2017-07-27,5,"I like other states radio stations I like this app because I am able to listen to my favorite radio stations that I can not receive through regular FM stations out of my surrounding areas. I like to listen to Virginia and south Carolina and Ohio stations and Raleigh stations."
25882,"iHeartRadio",2016-07-03,5,"LOVE IT LOVE this app. Used Pandora until it glitched and I found this. I can actually use the alarm clock on my kindle. It personalizes your music by asking what u do and do not like. U can make ur own stations and I just love it. U should totally try this app."
25883,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-15,2,"more commercials lately I deleted Pandora because of the commercials. I tolerated them on IHR because they only ever seemed to come up when I logged in and they were infrequent. Lately, it seems like every time I log in and whenever I switch stations. I tolerated the UI change a few months ago because I had to. I tolerated the repetition that threatened to kill songs like Lodi through endless repetition and the songs that do not belong on the station no matter where the dial is set because I ASSumed that they were collecting data on my skips and thumbs down and would improve. I tolerated the skip limit because I figured Clear Channel would just say something dismissive like 'use your iPod' if I complainedoh, wait...I did! so I just figured I would look for a paid version. It did not come upat least not conspicuously and I lost patience just like when I try to sit through eternal and irritating commercials because I want to hear Bill Handel. that is why I only listen to KUSC any more. Congrats, Clear Channel; you drove a head of cattle away from the chute! You get a second star for helping me wake up."
25891,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-11,5,"Great App I have been finding all kinds of music I had forgotten about. I just found a genuine oldies station out of Minneapolis that plays music from the 50's and 60's. I live in Georgia so this is the only way for me to tune in to this great music. XM radio is too expensive on my retirement income."

25896,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-22,5,"Amazing Quality and Very Well Designed! This app lets you play your favorite music within the touch of a button... literally. Comparing it to such other apps like Pandora, I think it is almost as well designed with some features poorly thought of an others superb! For example, this app includes an alarm clock and sleep time. Pandora on the other hand let you add variety to your stations. . Although this app could be better, I strongly recommend it to anyone in need of their own variety of music."
25898,"iHeartRadio",2016-09-18,5,"Makes my work day better! Addicted to this service. Last year I started listening to the Santa Fe and Alaska radio/news and it helped me to get a better feel for the area before we visited. I love the commercial free stations and the choices.

25910,"iHeartRadio",2016-05-04,5,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! This is wonderful! The music choices I wanted, I found; jazz is my favorite form of music...there is so much to choose from, I was stunned. I was even able to get old-time radio shows. This app does not just stop, then buffer, then nothing. The sound quality is excellent and you do not have to constantly adjust volume levels."

25923,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-09,5,"Awesome music app! This app is AWESOME for listening to music! I have no problem with other apps like Pandora, but this app is better in my opinion It is very easy to use. It has so many stations and songs. I wish it did not need internet to listen to, but that is not worth bringing down the 5 star rating over."
25924,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-09,5,"Perfection I know a lot of people say they like all kinds of music, then go on to list only a few kinds. I am one of those that truly loves all music. This app is absolutely amazing for any kind of music lover though! I love that I can listen to 60's hits for a while then switch over to pop and finish up with a little country. Later maybe some soft rock and then blues and hey why not a bit of jazz.It has enough to make anyone get excited about music and keep you dancing all day long.The alarm features are perfect and the fact that I can listen to music while reading an ebook at the same time on my kindle is awesome!"
25931,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-29,4,"Not bad I heard good things about this app, so I downloaded it. I like that you can listen to some live music channels without having to log into Facebook or an email account. But it seems that if you want to customize at all what channels you want to listen to, it forces you to log in to Facebook or an email account, which I usually do not feel like going to all the bother to do. So my selection of music is limited due to that. Usually I just like to open apps and use them without going into another account. But it is a free app at least, which is good."

I can not believe how clear the channels are even for AM channels which if you use a regular radio will know that AM channels do not come in that clear. I like that I can listen to any station in the country which is awesome because I have found some interesting stations that play all the music that I like. it is also nice when traveling and you want to listen to a station from back home."

25953,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-15,3,"Not Like the Desktop Good, like that I can still get my stations when I am in a store, etc. However, I am frustrated with the Save Station issue. I have saved my home stations like I do on my desktop computer but can not call them back up to switch over. The Stations tab is annoyingly blank. Also need to remember call letters for stations and it is harder to search by area station is in. Just received an update today, so we will see how it works out...This was originally downloaded to my new smartphone where I have had the problems. I recently downloaded it to my Kindle, but haven't had time to play with it much to see if it just needs a bigger screen than on my phone."
25955,"iHeartRadio",2017-10-02,5,"Great app. I am really loving iHeart Great app. I am really loving iHeart. The only thing I can do without is the live shows. I am not a fan of those at all."
25958,"iHeartRadio",2015-09-16,4,"Love it, but... Okay, so I love this app with all of my heart, BUT I have some issues with it. No it does not lag, does not shut down on me, etc, but it DOES make me watch an ad before I can listen. that is my first pet peeve with this. The second one is the fact that I have a SKIP. LIMIT. It annoys me so much, I can not stand it. I have several customized stations, and the thing is, if there is a song I do not like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist, I can not. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall, a decent app. The sound quality is good, there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations, and it is easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."
25959,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,2,"Not as Advertised but it is free The pop-up ad on my Kindle Fire said there were hundreds of radio stations. So far I have found about 6 different KISS or KIIS FM stations from various large cities and none of them play any of the music I want to hear. I will probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I am not hopeful. At least the ap and the usage are free so I have only wasted my time at worst. Note - I thought each radio station had to have a unique call sign but apparently things have changed with the internet age."
25962,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-16,5,"Works Great Love this on my new Kindle HD. Great choices and great reception. Would recommend this App to anyone. I really enjoy it."
25963,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-04,4,"Local station for The Big Show I do not like the hard rock played on the local iHeart station, or any station for that matter. But the local Columbus, Georgia,,,and surrounding Alabama..station 103 102.9 runs the John Boy and Billy. Big Show 6 days a week from 6am to 10 am EST. And I faithfully listen to the show. I can get it on my Android phone and iPad as well! So I rate a four star to iHeart for having the programming flexibility for airing the Big Show. Other people I know say the same and that iHeart should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for 20 hours and all day Sunday, when the Big Show is not broadcast!"
25967,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-13,5,"Cool app Looking for an app to listen to music on my Kindle and decided to give this one a try. It has a couple of different features that I haven't tried like an alarm clock but it does have a couple different radio stations. Not tons of stations just a couple from across the country in each different genre of music. It does have a comedy channel. For a free app it does not have lots of commercials, but every 5 minutes or so you will get a 5 second commercial. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a way to play radio on your kindle."
25971,"iHeartRadio",2015-12-25,5,"best!!!!! If you love music but you can not seem to find a app that knows what you like, you are in luck! This app has tons of the music that you love and the amazing part is this app is free! If you are looking at these comments to help you understand if you want to download this app, I am telling you, get iHeartRadio!!!!"
25976,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-19,4,"enjoying Iheartradio I wish I could get more local stations. I listen to Cleveland and Houston because they have the programs I want to hear. I live in Oregon. Also when I click on Elvis Radio or Beatles radio, I wanted to hear them, and only one in 3-10 songs is what I wanted. I have learned you have to program the stations to eventually play what you are wanting to hear. I thought Elvis radio would play Elvis. No so. the first 10 songs you might get 3 Elvis then not again for 10 or more songs. BOO! It is a fun oldies station, but not what I was expecting. I am working on programing it now but takes a while. Same with the other stations, Beatles, etc."
25978,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-08,3,"not user friendly Granted I haven't used it much. The first time out was to live stream a specific radio station, which seems to be the best use of this app. Or using their pre-built play lists. To me it is not very user friendly when it comes to customizing, and to me the genres and artist lists seem limited. I do not really get their mood/activity suggestions either. I have been a big Pandora fan for several years, with a paid subscription and I would definitely use Pandora first. I was having some interference issues so I loaded iHeartRadio to compare and trouble shoot."
25980,"iHeartRadio",2017-08-02,2,"Awful for podcasts I used to use iheart daily for my favorite radio show in the morning and later for podcasts. I just downloaded onto my fire tablet, and the radio plays fine, but every time I select a podcast, the app spazzes out and skips, trying to select an episode but not playing any at all. Deleting and redownloading solved nothing. It can be noted that it played a couple podcasts yesterday with no problem."
25984,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-29,4,"I enjoy it. I wish that there was more variety ... I listen every morning to The Standard. I enjoy it. I wish that there was more variety without having to pay the monthly fee."
25989,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-09,3,"Not as good as it should be Ok app, but it limits you to how many times you can change a song from one you do not like to a different one. This means that once you reach your limit you have to listen to a song you might not like. that is not a good thing. Otherwise it is ok..."
25991,"iHeartRadio",2015-11-18,5,"All my favorite songs in different radio stations and FREE Love listening to my iHeart radio when I am near my Kindle Fire, Smartphone-Tracphone, or using my desk top computer.

25999,"iHeartRadio",2012-03-31,3,"Not very good. The iHeartRadio app is okay, but not very good. The custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to Pandora or Slacker. The app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds. The interface is fast. Too fast. If you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly. There is no way to undo it if you do. If it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app is not useful. If you want to listen to the real stations, I would recommend this app. If you just want the custom stations feature, I would recommend Slacker, Pandora, or Jango instead."
26007,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-10,4,"not bad for personal training session I am a personal trainer who also teaches some HITT and interval training classes. This app is great for one on one training session or personal use. Only thing I wish was I could personalize the station more for a class setting, like create a station based on BPM's and advisory labels. Lol do not want a song about sex coming on while I train a class of 40-50 year old women lol"
26009,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-29,5,"Checkout NY Radio Stations I think because of the time shift, I am able to hear more music at times when I listen, if I listen to radio stations in NY and sometimes Miami. Plus it is fun to hear ads for local stuff that I have absolutely no context for.

Castles in the Air. Listeners can create their own radio stations by song or artist, if choose radio stations from stations around the country. Trouble is, I began to experience problems with the kindle. Running Internet radio opens up network sockets. I am not a technical wizard, but after running the radio the kindle would get hung up while I was on facebook. I love listening to music while on the Internet, but nit ag the expense of technical trouble. Download at your own risk."

When you are signed in, you can get reccomended songs for kids, funny songs, and holiday songs. All of it is free, and there is not a ton of ads popping up. Plus, if you close out of the app or turn off the screen, the songs will still play while you look stuff up on the internet or whatever. I highly reccomended this app to anyone!"

The ability to create stations from your favorite artists and listen to radio stations from around the nation is great, and it means that you are never stuck listening to just a handful of local stations all the time.

I have to hit the pause button then hit the play button about once every ten minutes or so. I have contacted Iheart about this and was given several ideas of how to make the problem go away, but none have worked. Now, I am inclined to think this may be an advertizing scheme of Iheart. Each time I have to restart the program, I have to listen to a commercial then the program I was listening to resumes. Does Iheart have a counter going on that ticks off one more tune in by a customer for the company they are advertising for?I am inclined to think Iheart will not let this comment be posted."

Using only TuneIn I could listen to the programs I wanted live but from another city, but iHeart has some local stations TuneIn does not and vice versa. If you are stuck with commercials, they might as well be for something that applicable to you same for news and weather. Of the two I do prefer TuneIn, but additional choices is always a good thing"

26549,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-21,1,"Iheart radio app I am pretty disappointed in the Iheart radio app. I have loaded it on my iphone and tried it out for several hours. I tried to get Christmas music and it did not do very well the first few songs were rap versions of Christmas and it would then not let me skip the ones I did not like. I tried instrumental which by definition should not contain any vocals and within a couple of songs came up with vocals I was able to skip the first few then I hit the skip limit. I tried several other stations like Mannheim steamroller and soon had rap again. I then tried Trans Siberian and ended up after a few songs with some pretty heavy hard rock and techno rock. Which is fine but not what I had asked for. I had a lot better luck with Pandora in the past. I may have to reload Pandora and use it instead."
26551,"iHeartRadio",2012-05-09,5,"AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!! Have no idea why some people are not liking this awesome app. You DO NOT need a facebook to use it as others have stated. Have had no problems on my kindle fire. There is even an option that provides you the lyrics to the song you are listening to. If you do not want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!"

26582,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-24,1,"USED TO be may favorite app. Now, it does not work. I use this a lot or rather I used to. It was my favorite Kindle app. The app has an alarm that turns on my favorite morning station at 7am every weekday. I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening as I worked around the house until lunch time. Both are News/Talk stations. My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem Daaaad... my Kindle is not working right... .Several updates ago about a month or so, it just stopped working. When it does turn on it is not reliable as an alarm anymore, it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing. I have to close the app or stop the station and then hit play again. It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked. Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I do not really use my Kindle Fire HD. Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest versions just do not work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it is not the station. The previous version did not do it, so I do not think it is my Kindle besides, other radio apps and Audible all work fine. If I switch to PC, it seems to work no perfectly, but mostly fine. I am sure it was an unintended consequence of a new feature or fixing some other problem, but THIS APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW. sad"

Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."

I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc.I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well. If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."

26837,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-11,4,"Great App I really enjoy this app. As someone who listens to a lot of music, this helps me to find new artists that sound like ones I already like and listen to. However, they do not have some of the live stations I listen to all the time, and the alarm clock feature does not always work. Despite these minor difficulties, if you are looking for an app where you can listen to music, I suggest this one."
26838,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-03,5,"Five Stars One of my favorite music apps and it just gets better and better!"

26933,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-28,3,"I like this app and the stations it has to choose from or create. but... I like this app and the stations it has to choose from or create. The only thing I hate is that many of these stations are like on a loop recorded feed and repeat a lot of the content. If you listen for a few hours, some stations will recycle through the same playlists, and same DJ rhetoric as the previous hours or days before. It is not always live, but a good app for music overall."
26937,"iHeartRadio",2011-12-08,1,"hello again, Pandora... broken... does not even Force Crash. the UI is horribly laggy and just freezes up my Kindle Fire every time... definitely not better than Pandora based off my experience."

It will work again after I restart the app but it will eventually crash again. it is just annoying whenever I am listening to a great song and then have to restart the app because then the song changes. I do not know if this happens with other devices lately but it did not do this with my Kindle Fire or Optimus U, but it crashes with my Galaxy S Aviator. Please fix this problem!"

Search for your favorite artists, too! Compared to Pandora, this offers more variety, options to expand your listening variety, instant favorite additions at a push of a button, no pesky adds for a paid version, and best of all no 40 hour a month restrictions on music listening. I love this app the more I use it! Check it out!"
26979,"iHeartRadio",2017-07-10,5,"Great app for music I got this app a few days ago and I love It. If one station is one commercial u can skip to another. Very easy to use"
26986,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-30,5,"A great alternative to Pandora.... Not only can you stream live radio from anywhere, but you can create your own stations based upon an artist or band. It has a great feature that allows you to dial in very similar to not-so-similar artists and you can 'sculpt' the character of the station by rating a particular song, thumbs up/down. AND you can play outside the US. Pandora? NO! Also, you can get great information about the artist, and follow links to buy material."
26989,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-09,5,"great but I got it it is a thousand times better easier to find music then Pandora Pandora is okay compared to iheartradio but for each song you can skip so many times then you have to go to the web site but even then I do not get more but I still give it a five star rating I can listen to New music I have never heard and find new songs that I like look at the good side!!! happy"
26990,"iHeartRadio",2017-06-10,5,"Five Stars Easy to use."
26991,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,1,"WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process. Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps.. With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can not find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal. It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating. I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all. If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch. It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to. An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

Clear Channel took away the ONLY rock station in Atlanta and replaced it with yet another bubble-gum pop station. Atlanta already has at least FIVE other stations JUST like it. They took away Project 9-6-1 leaving countless Project Family members without a radio home. Clear Channel is a greedy corporation who blatantly refuses to listen to its customers and is only interested in filling their pockets with money. Do what is right and help us Project Family members get our station back. do not download this app! we are not asking for a whole lot. We just want to rock on. Is that so much to ask for?To Clear Channel: Screw you! Your ways of marketing are horrendous. Keep your customers in mind. Bring back our Project 9-6-1 and leave us the flip alone. Take that bubble-gum pop crap station off our rock station! If you think our anger will just fizzle out and fade away, you are horribly, horribly wrong. The longer you go without listening to us, the harder we will fight back. We live by one simple rule. We live LOUD and we play HARD.Keep rocking on Project members!"

27281,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-20,5,"Best in the Biz I have found It convenient that it is free radio for mobile devices. There is only one inconvenience; the app requires Wi-Fi. Other than that the app is outstanding. First, you can favorite the station's you like and pick the type of music you want. Secondly, there are all types of music to play and listen to you can listen while device is off!. Lastly, the layout of this app is updated and fresh."
27282,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-08,4,"Love It Pandora is great but it had limits to how much you can listen. I heart radio allows me to listen to my favorite music and radio stations.

I can listen to the radio stations just fine. The only reason you need to have a Facebook account is if you want to save the radio stations as a favorite. It does not interfere at all with choosing a radio station and listening to the amazing music! I can listen to local radio stations or I can listen to stations all over the US. There are many stations for each genre of music as well. I love this app. There is nothing better than a free app to listen to music anytime I want to!"

27601,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-02,1,"Monopolistic. This is a terrible application, indicative of the current state of radio. Why do I need to download a proprietary app to listen to a radio station? Why can not I surf to a website and stream from there? Information. Nobody is listening to garbage radio anymore and they need ratings information so they can sell you a new mattress. Plus it is buggy. do not give in."

27631,"Pandora",2014-12-28,4,"So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface Just getting started with Pandora. So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface. Got an IHome wireless speaker for my Kindle Fire HDX so I can not have music I like wherever I like. There are commercials, but are not terribly annoyin."
27632,"Pandora",2014-02-05,5,"Highly recommended I have been a Pandora user for quite some time. I use it on all my computers at home and at my office. I appreciate the fact that I can input the artists and style of music I prefer. If something is played I would rather not listen to again I can input that fact. I can listen to my playlist randomly, or select a particular artist/style to play. I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I am reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle. I have tried several other downloadable music sites, and have found Pandora to be the most versatile and have the greatest choice of music as well as being the easiest to use."
27638,"Pandora",2016-02-16,4,"I like the service but find the app not very intuitive ... I like the service but find the app not very intuitive in terms of use. Perhaps a link to instructions on how best to set up your own channels would be helpful."
27639,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain I guess that is the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
27642,"Pandora",2016-04-25,5,"Is awesome.. Its great to hear songs you remember ... Every song I choose or radio artist..Is awesome..Its great to hear songs you remember as a Rockin young person,and is just as fun now to listen!"
27646,"Pandora",2016-07-20,5,"Highly Recommended I have been using Pandora Radio for years, I love the stations I have created and I am always surprised at the song choices they suggest, hidden treasures or forgotten favorites!"
27656,"Pandora",2015-08-01,1,"What a waste of Stopped working immediately and had to call Pandora. Next use was equal to one song at a time. After screwing with it for way too long, just changed to a different streaming program. What a waste of time"
27657,"Pandora",2013-01-31,5,"love it well you cant go wrong with Pandora in the first place. Awesome music, the lyrics to sing by and easy to use"
27658,"Pandora",2015-08-01,4,"nothing evil in THIS box! Being able to pick stations for your favorite music means very little you dislike, though Pandora limits the number of pieces you can skip through, and there are ads unless you pay to avoid them."
27661,"Pandora",2013-03-20,5,"The internet music standard - for good reason This app has always made advances with internet radio and does not disappoint. it is very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course. You can set up your own channels and listen to everything from rock to classical to comedy bits.An excellent app that everyone should have, in my opinion.-D"
27663,"Pandora",2016-03-10,3,"Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like. The only problem is it has loading problems. It can take a long time to start the next song."
27666,"Pandora",2017-01-01,4,"Good App This App was installed on the daughter's new 8 Fire HD and she likes it very much."
27672,"Pandora",2015-11-15,4,"Very Nice Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can not get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it is the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. happy"
27674,"Pandora",2014-02-27,4,"love it Awesome app. Really wish the kindle version did not take off the sleep timer though. I miss that feature, can not fall asleep to the music anymore because I have to wake up to turn it off. Sigh. Other than that I love this for everything else. Music is in everything I breathe and Pandora almost always plays my moods."
27675,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars I love me some PANDORA would not change for anything unless it is better."
27677,"Pandora",2015-11-03,2,"went wrong since last update -.- Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."

27681,"Pandora",2015-02-25,4,"The app does what it is meant to do The app does what it is meant to, open a direct link to your Pandora account. It does not do anything else because it does not have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient."

Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. there is way better options out there."

27698,"Pandora",2013-12-07,5,"Great Music, more choices, It works for me. I love it. I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music. Some also use it. I am 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio. There is less music on the car radio then ever before. I like having choices and with Pandora you do."
27700,"Pandora",2016-07-07,5,"Awesome customizability yall Love this app. I know its been around for years now but I just decided to check it out. Love customizing my own stations."
27702,"Pandora",2013-10-09,5,"Love it! I did not realize how much I would enjoy the Pandora app. I carry my Kindle from room to room or out on the porch and have constant, great music that I like. No more tuning in a radio. Really like that it identifies the artist - there are songs I have heard before but did not know who was singing. Just this app alone makes the Kindle worth it!"
27704,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"Broken app no longer! Thank you for fixing. We are going back to 5 stars. PANDORA!!! Have you even noticed the comments since your last update? Hope you are working on a fix. Thanks for bringing me music before that."

27718,"Pandora",2016-08-05,5,"Love, love Love, love, love having someone else choose music for me. I pick a style I want to hear, and Pandora does the rest."
27720,"Pandora",2016-09-13,5,"All you need. Almost anything you want. Even ...Mother's of Invention...best part.. No messing around start it ,it plays"
27724,"Pandora",2015-01-03,5,"Five Stars Really happy with this app. Add stations then shuffle, could not be easier to customize the music."
27729,"Pandora",2017-05-04,5,"Five Stars excellent music. use a lot."
27731,"Pandora",2014-03-07,3,"Like Pandora BUT.......... I have had a Pandora account for a longtime but had not used it in quite a while. When I downloaded it on my new Droid XX, I found it very annoying because the ads out number the music. I found the monthly fee to avoid the ads to be twice as high as it should be. In the past I paid dollar 15 for a subscription."
27732,"Pandora",2013-01-18,4,"Great site! Great site with extended and complete information about songs and artist.Unfortunetly too much advertisment, but the service is excellent."
27735,"Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"Replaces XM radio This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."
27741,"Pandora",2013-04-26,5,"Great App This is a great app for those who love music. Works great on any device and I is easy to use."
27744,"Pandora",2017-07-29,3,"Three Stars It does not offer what I thought it would"
27745,"Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"Pandora is terrific I like the idea of selecting my own music. It is free. If I like an album I can buy it on Pandora. The variety is outstanding."
27747,"Pandora",2017-01-24,5,"Rock with Classic Rock on Pandora! Pandora has my music choices and really like to send it on the bluetooth speakers."
27748,"Pandora",2014-01-14,2,"Before You Buy It, Wait. I bought this by reading the great comments and every single time that I login and just keep it on I actually try to just click it and when I do it says loading and it will not go on. Multiple times I download it again and it works the first time and after that it does the same things. This is now my 7th time getting it."
27750,"Pandora",2014-09-18,5,"Two Thumbs Up ! A big fan of free radio. Could do with less commercials, but I love the customization options it offers. One bug fix I would love to see though, is that on the Kindle Fire HD it will not work with other apps open, even the Silk browser. Other than that, it is perfect!"
27759,"Pandora",2015-06-14,3,"I use it every day, on my phone and ... I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it is gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening. But last year it was dollar 3.99 a month, and now it is bumped up to dollar 4.99 a month. Uh... no thank you."
27760,"Pandora",2015-06-08,5,"Great app I love Pandora.. The fact that I can choose what I want to listen to and subscribe for commercial free music for such a cheap price is awesome... Satellite radio is expensive and you do not get to choose anything"
27761,"Pandora",2016-01-24,5,"Awesome app This app is completely useful instead of having to go on YouTube and searching for your favorite song I guarantee your favorite song will come on with Pandora"
27764,"Pandora",2013-06-16,5,"Lots of music fun! Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to like and dislike songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
27768,"Pandora",2016-01-18,4,"I love Pandora for both work and home I love Pandora for both work and home. I do wish it had less commercials and I had a tad more control over songs, but I have it for free so no real complaints!"
27769,"Pandora",2017-06-24,5,"Five Stars can not beat it for its variety and ease."
27770,"Pandora",2017-10-25,4,"Four Stars Like my play list. Although they are not able to pull in all the music I request."
27771,"Pandora",2016-12-26,5,"Love it Love pandora. Ads pop up here and there but i dnt find them invasive or annoying."
27775,"Pandora",2013-08-04,5,"Music your way It deserves a 5 star rating because there is nothing out there like it. could there be some improvements now that i have experienced for years now, yes. but they are very small. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of hearing the insulting to your intelligence commercials and are tired of hearing the same 10 songs played over and over again."
27776,"Pandora",2016-09-02,5,"Five Stars it is free and plays great music tailored to the person's preference, it does not get any better than that."
27783,"Pandora",2014-03-13,3,"Good, but unfortunate commercials I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I do not like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear. For example, on the Radio for Kids station, there is an egg donation commercial that comes on often that has spurred odd questions."
27784,"Pandora",2016-12-08,5,"I love it. I have not invested in the ad ... I love it. I have not invested in the ad free version however I am considering it."
27786,"Pandora",2016-08-31,5,"I love being able to design my own stations to my ... Pandora is so accommodating. I love being able to design my own stations to my liking.Thanks Pandora"
27789,"Pandora",2017-01-25,5,"Five Stars I have enjoyed Pandora on my laptop. It was exciting to also have it on my Fire!"
27790,"Pandora",2017-01-18,4,"Four Stars it is all the music I like, made especially for me. Plus it is free. love Pandora."
27796,"Pandora",2015-01-02,5,"Great Great"
27798,"Pandora",2017-09-21,4,"Four Stars Best for internet radio."
27800,"Pandora",2016-02-05,4,"Very good selection of songs as Had it before. Very good selection of songs as,well as similar within the genre. Easy to use. Excellent sound quality. Outshines Sirius by a wide margin."
27801,"Pandora",2013-09-25,5,"Love it I can pick my style of music and hear just what I want, when I want it. Based on my keep or reject choices, Pandora will then send me a song according to my interest, If I do not like the next song I reject it and they will not ever play that song again. Eventually you build your own station and can share your music with others. It a keeper"
27802,"Pandora",2016-11-26,5,"Would Recommend Works great. I love Pandora, its the best free music app I have found. Would recommend."
27804,"Pandora",2013-01-17,5,"Love this app My taste in music is pretty diverse. Every genre of music I have searched has been able to be located on Pandora. I would recommend it to anyone who wants music on the go."
27807,"Pandora",2017-09-08,5,"Five Stars love this app.. just hate that i have to pay for no commercials.."
27808,"Pandora",2016-05-24,4,"good app Great app but has some limitations. I tend to use Spotify more often than Pandora because you can save songs to your own files."
27809,"Pandora",2017-02-10,5,"My Pandora Love Pandora, have it now on my new Fire tablet because I use it on my I Phone."
27812,"Pandora",2013-04-07,5,"New listener I enjoy the freedom of listening to music types I like through my cellphone or computer. Overall I enjoy listening to the artist I choose and the simular artists. I would prefer though a little heavier emphasis on my chosen artist within the mix. I was introduced to Pandora by my daughter a few weeks ago and have very much enjoyed the listening experience. Thank you."
27820,"Pandora",2016-03-29,2,"Two Stars No bluegrass music"
27837,"Pandora",2014-08-10,4,"Great App its a great app. u can skip the songs u do not want to listen to, but u can only skip so many. but u can listen to the station from ur favorite artist. and if u want to buy that song, it will take you straight to the site so u can buy it. it is totally awesome. I love it!"

27843,"Pandora",2016-02-03,4,"Upgrade if possible If you are able to afford Pandora One it is worth it! Regular Pandora is frustrating to listen to with all the commercial interruptions..just my opinion"
27845,"Pandora",2014-02-26,4,"Free Music! I enjoy having a diverse selection of artists and musicians at my fingertips! it is also an added bonus that you get to know new artists as well. If you love music, you will love Pandora. They do repeat songs and the ads are annoying but it is the price you pay for free-you can always upgrade to Pandora One."
27848,"Pandora",2016-07-25,5,"Lovin' Every Minute!! I can find all the songs I love. And have it on at work, home and in the car!! I am a Pandora fanatic!!🎶👍🏻🎶!!"
27850,"Pandora",2015-01-07,5,"Awesome! So awesome! I love that I can type in any song/artist/or movie that I am thinking of and it will play similar songs. It usually takes forever to hear the particular song I was looking for. But I hear some other great ones along the way happy"
27864,"Pandora",2016-07-08,5,"I love Pandora, and have the app on my cell ... I love Pandora, and have the app on my cell phone. I thought I may as well play it from my Kindle Fire tablet too."
27869,"Pandora",2016-06-28,5,"amazing this is a great app to listen to your favorite music. and new hits. I definetly recommend this app if you love music."
27870,"Pandora",2013-12-11,4,"A must have app! I love Pandora and this is a very nice app. It allows you to access all of your channels and explore music intuitively. The only thing that I was not terribly fond of was the interface for creating new channels and finding music outside of your already defined channels. Otherwise it is a great app and very functional."
27880,"Pandora",2017-02-26,5,"Five Stars All processes of my purchase went as described in listing. I appreciate you."
27882,"Pandora",2017-08-21,1,"One Star Great music source. I am my own DJ"
27886,"Pandora",2013-09-18,5,"Pandora makes my day! This is the best thing since iTunes. I use Pandora quite a few hours a day. I also have it on my tablet. Everyone should join Pandora One. The fee for a year is so good and gives you want, what is so nice is that you can also load it on your cell phone and then play on your car radio.I urge everyone to join and enjoy."
27889,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"Downloaded it to kindlefire works great. you will need a high speed internet connection Used it on computers before. Downloaded it to kindlefire works great. you will need a high speed internet connection. It was banned from my work computers because the employees where hogging the bandwidth with Pandora. Ads not bad"
27895,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"Pandora alows yo to hearb YOUR music! Great way to get a great mix of your music anywhere!"
27896,"Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"yes Love the new way you set it up Pandora.

And Pandora you have picked the best songs for my stations!The Music Listener,Lillypop"
27901,"Pandora",2017-01-11,5,"Five Stars Not a purchase, but an app that I use regularly. Thank you for the service."
27902,"Pandora",2017-01-26,5,"Five Stars Love Pandora. I listen to Bluegrass gospel and it is hard to find on radio."

27905,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music I am a first time user of Pandora. I find it very user friendly. I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music."
27907,"Pandora",2013-11-16,3,"Great idea, not so great execution. I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the bugs are annoying!"
27908,"Pandora",2014-12-13,5,"I made a Motley Crue station gotta love the 80s hair metal I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that are not even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station gotta love the 80s hair metal, and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL"
27909,"Pandora",2014-01-17,2,"hard to access I love being able to listen to music but the program is very difficult to understand how it works. There are not very clear instructions on how to get the type of music I like and put it all into a stream so I can listen. I do not want to have to have a tab for each song but rather a stream of constant music."
27913,"Pandora",2016-12-20,4,"Four Stars Love Pandora. Wish that you could skip more songs when you want to though."
27915,"Pandora",2016-05-31,4,"Great but messes up a lot... it is really good!You get the listen to music for free!The only think I do not like about it is...that is messes up a lot.."

27933,"Pandora",2014-03-25,4,"Pandora you program your station with the music you want and some suggestions from Pandora. they have a larges selection of music and comedy to choose from. you just have to watch how much you use this app because after so many hours a month you have to pay for it, but it is free up til that amount."
27936,"Pandora",2016-11-12,5,"Five Stars Enjoy Pandora"
27938,"Pandora",2016-12-06,2,"Two Stars Way too many commercials and the stations will only play your artist, rarely"

So for that reason I Must give it 5 Stars!"
27941,"Pandora",2013-08-23,5,"I love Pandora! I was hesitant at first before buying the app, but I fell in love with Pandora. I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!"
27942,"Pandora",2014-05-05,5,"toats love it I toats love this app!!!!!!!!I use this all the time to listen to the latest pop music for free. All you do is look up a singer or song. Then, you pick a station. Then music will start playing and if you do not like the song, you can skip it.Toast love it!!!!!! and number 60;3 happy"
27945,"Pandora",2016-07-28,5,"Lots of variety I really miss Songza so was on the hunt for a new app to play music. Found Pandora, tried it, and love it."
27947,"Pandora",2013-01-09,5,"Expand your musical ear What I love about Pandora is being exposed to artists and genres that heretofore I was not aware of, then being inspired to buy artists' recordings. No commercials, just good, solid music. Interested in Brazilian? Zydeco? Salsa? Top 40? Sinatra and the Rat Pack? Karmin and more? Even little-known artists are on here Lee PressOn and the Nails for one. Give your ear a treat!"

27953,"Pandora",2015-11-20,1,"does not work with new update I personally love Pandora but with the new update it freezes up every few songs or does not play at all. I will keep this bad reveiw up until my old friend is back."
27959,"Pandora",2013-06-24,4,"Plays well, most of the time. Needs more extensive song list though. Plays pretty well. BUt there have been several songs /artists that are far from unknown that I thought surely would be included and were not showing up at all in search! This needs improving, also on the FREE version, there seems a lot of stopping, and pausing between playing tracks. BUt hey, it is FREE so am not really complaining. Haha!! ;o"
27960,"Pandora",2016-10-31,3,"Three Stars lots of advertisement and only plays a few songs of the artist's radio you choose.."
27961,"Pandora",2013-08-04,5,"The Most Amazing Music App Ever! This is probably the best music app available today. I can listen to all my favorite stations including artists such as Lindsey Stirling, Ellie Goulding, The Script, OneRepublic, and Carrie Underwood. You can even browse genre stations too! I listen it practically every day and I always find great new songs! I highly recommend this app!"
27962,"Pandora",2013-05-21,4,"Pandora I love Pandora because of the ease of use and because I can quickly create and customize my radio stations.I did not rate Pandora a five simply because one must suscribe to the paid service for unlimited listening. That said, I will probably upgrade to the paid service anyway, because it is really a nominal cost for such a great service."
27965,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Listen It gets to know what you like and plays songs accordingly"
27973,"Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"Five Stars I enjoy listening to pandora."

27978,"Pandora",2013-11-06,3,"A let down on the Kindle. I do not know if it is this version of Pandora or my Kindle that makes this app take so long to load. I have a solid connection, but it can take five to ten minutes for this to begin playing. I also cannot find any way to close it without turning my Kindle off. I love Pandora on my iBook, but this version on my Kindle."
27983,"Pandora",2014-06-19,3,"disappointed I created a channel I titled Eagles Radio , feeling like listening to some mellow, classic rock one day. I have yet to have them play a single Eagles tune since I told them what I prefer. They DO play a lot of B sides by groups I was not all that fond of."
27988,"Pandora",2017-01-13,1,"One Star I HATE Pandora- too many stupid ads!! I will never use this app again!"
27989,"Pandora",2014-08-09,5,"I LOVE THIS APP!!! I love this app!! You can not beat free music anywhere!!! I love how you can play music while playing any other app!!

27992,"Pandora",2015-01-09,3,"the features and the platform of pandora are pretty good. but the songs that are played can ... the features and the platform of pandora are pretty good. but the songs that are played can become very repetitive. I think this can be fixed by playing more than just the hits. I think there are plenty of other songs on albums that never get played which could add a lot more variety."
27993,"Pandora",2016-03-07,5,"Always saves the day I listen to all types of music and Pandora allows me to explore each avenue of my various favorites on any occasion. Gotta love Pandora!"
27995,"Pandora",2013-04-25,5,"Great radio station I down load this station to all of my pc's and tablets too. Not that I have that many. But for free, you can not go wrong. The only down fall is that sense they upgraded it I can not or do not know how to get to the part where you create your own stations. Or create new ones or add stuff. Other than that I love it it is the best. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan"
28005,"Pandora",2015-11-22,3,"Disappointed Disappointed because I haven't been able to listen to any songs yet on this app. Not sure if I am doing something wrong. Would appreciate some feedback on this"
28011,"Pandora",2017-10-06,5,"Love it Love Pandora - has all my favorite music."
28018,"Pandora",2014-10-13,3,"Not what it is cracked up to be I do not like that it does not let you skip more than one or two songs in an hour of listening. considering that you are not getting ONLY the artist whose music you selected, they should let you pass on more of the selections they feature."
28020,"Pandora",2014-04-29,5,"My favorite way to listen to music! I enjoy many different styles and genres of music and Pandora will play songs from all of them and mix it up any way I want them to. I love the control and also the 'suggested' artists that fit into my chosen artist genres. I only wish I could have Pandora on my car radio as well!"
28023,"Pandora",2013-11-25,5,"Good enough I am now paying dollar for it. Not much to say. Its a music service. That gives me exactly what I want to hear and listens to me when i tell it I do not like something and would rather not hear it again. I plug it in at work and set my stations and rock out in the kitchen all day. it is great. Great enough that I decided to pay for it. happy"
28024,"Pandora",2014-04-05,1,"not recommended i downloaded this to my asus from windows and had issues with it. Downloaded it to my kindle fire first. Turns out, it is not a verified app from pandora. it violates pandora's terms of use to use this app."
28029,"Pandora",2017-08-20,5,"Five Stars two thumbs up"
28030,"Pandora",2014-02-12,3,"Depends This is a good site, depending on whose hands it is in. There are so many genres of music available, that everybody should be happy. I do not mind it for myself at all, but my kids were listening to things I did not want them to listen to. I had to delete it for the present time until they can make better choices."
28031,"Pandora",2015-04-13,5,"Perfect gift This is the best thing we ever found. My mom loves music and at ninety years old I am always trying to find something for her. This hit the nail on the head and when I can get it away from her I get to listen."
28036,"Pandora",2014-04-20,5,"Best online radio ever! I will say it again, Best online radio ever. I like the fact that I can change the type of music I like to hear to suet my mood. I have it on my Kindle Fire. The sound is fantastic. Plus I can listen to Pandora while I read or play certain games. it is great. Thank You. Billy Billing."
28037,"Pandora",2016-02-02,1,"Only plays 1 Song Only plays 1 song at a time then freezes up on my Kindle Fire. Closing the app does not get it to work, have to restart then still plays1 song."

28053,"Pandora",2016-11-19,4,"Four Stars It a good music app but I do not like how you have a limited amour if skips."
28057,"Pandora",2014-02-15,4,"Good Music Selection Good music and much better selection than XMRadio. The only draw back is the frequency that the music stops. It is much better with a subscription as there are no commercials however it still stops playing way too often requiring restarting or notification that I am still listening ."
28077,"Pandora",2013-07-15,5,"amazing I love the app for pandora. Anywhere you go you can jam out to your favorite tunes! Requires 3g or 4g or internet to play but still it wotks great. Its just like the web based version but portable. I wish they didnt have commercials but you gotta pay for that . Other than that its angreat app.and i recommend it to anyone and everyone."
28082,"Pandora",2016-10-31,4,"New to Pandora I am New to the music apps. Not able to compare. Like it so far. Still learning"

28099,"Pandora",2016-02-16,1,"Auto boot No option to cancel the boot on start up, which means it will always be running until I manually close it every time. Will not be using."
28101,"Pandora",2017-03-01,3,"it is too slow! It never loads on a kindle fire!!!!!!"
28102,"Pandora",2013-12-18,5,"satisfies my satisfy meter it is great for phones like android and kindle and Apple iPods/iPads. I would prefer spotify better but it only lets you have a trial for 2 days unless you buy premium and haha no I do not want to buy your premium carp at least pandora is cool like that and has just adds not trials pandora thank you love"
28121,"Pandora",2013-07-27,5,"great music whatever your mood is Easy to set up a station by genre with the option to skip a song if it is is not what you expected. Or pick an artist and Pandora will find all the albums and shuffle them for you. it is a bit like i-tunes on an i-pad... but much more powerful. At this moment, I am listening to 'Film Scores Radio' on my Kindle Fire. it is great."

I have tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly. I do not want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that is exactly what this provides. Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data that this does not use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data. There are a ton of visual advertisements!!! But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I do not see them. I do not know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."

Now that I have a kid, I use it to play lullabies most nights. It is wonderful to have constant random music that I love pop up rather than having to constantly cycle through my cds or deal with radio replays. There are not too many commercials, and lately, the free hour of music ads have been really appreciated."
28632,"Pandora",2015-01-11,5,"Same as any Pandora app which means very good. My only complaint about the Amazon Fire TV ... Same as any Pandora app which means very good.

You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you have never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that are not played on the radio very often anymore."
28988,"Pandora",2017-05-26,2,"Good, but far behind the iPhone version. This app is a joke compared to the iPhone version.

29012,"Pandora",2016-03-18,3,"Music app not what I would use again I understand developers want money. it is business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly do not need my email address or login to operate. Pandora is not one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it is not for me.Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required."
29014,"Pandora",2014-08-19,5,"Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations, artists, genres and the ability to mix and match etc. The only thing I wish I could do was listen to it in my old car, but I only have unlimited streaming at home. sad"

29095,"Pandora",2013-06-12,5,"AWESOME Two Words: Get It.But since I can not submit this with two words, I will rave about the awesome so that Pandora is. It has millions of stations to choose from, barely frequent ads, skips, and a thumbs up/down system that helps to get the music that you love. And it is free! How good does it get?"
29099,"Pandora",2013-06-17,5,"Love Pandora! Love Pandora. Sound quality is great! If you already have a Pandora account, you will be able to use this with ease.

29101,"Pandora",2014-04-03,5,"easy to select your favorite artist and. music I like it. Music selections fit. well in My initial selection. Theme.

29124,"Pandora",2016-03-02,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200 HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those filler channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar guide interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it is mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you are bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you are into some of the cable channels, you will notice a decline in program quality. If you are a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have those other 100 channels I really do not watch , and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"
29128,"Pandora",2014-12-22,5,"the best Best music app ever it may not allow you to choose specific songs but it adjusts to your taste when you vote thumbs up or thumbs down so get this if you want good permanent and free music"

29133,"Pandora",2016-01-30,4,"Love the music, but wish the ads were softer I love being able to play music at night while rocking the baby, but I hate that the volume of the ads are so much louder than the music that it wakes him up. The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me. Just how loud they are. I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies. That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."
29136,"Pandora",2015-04-23,5,"pandora is awesome Pandora is great. I use it very often it was easy simple to install. Sometime the advertisement are a lot but I do understand that pays for the great music service."

30245,"Pandora",2017-03-11,4,"Good, could be great Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to normalize the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up and thumbs down seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few deep tracks , just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"
30246,"Pandora",2016-08-20,5,"Five Stars Love the way I can play the music."

30249,"Pandora",2014-09-20,4,"Very interesting experiment. Hard to argue the quality of what this site offers for free. It does seem to progressively stray away from the channel you set up, but I guess that is kind of part of what it is about."
30257,"Pandora",2013-07-02,5,"Love Pandora Pandora has introduced me to so many new artists that I love. I do not have anything bad to say about it. One thing I do wish is that you could listen to a song again, or somehow store it on your device - but I understand why this can not be done. It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the dollar 36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps."

30267,"Pandora",2014-12-26,3,"If you hate ads then buy the ad-free version. Spend the extra 3 dollars so you do not have to keep getting the annoying advertisement pop-ups. That is the only reason that I have for the less than great rating."

30389,"Pandora",2016-12-23,5,"Five Stars good"
30390,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"LOVE! Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe should not hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons thumbs or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it is great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"
30391,"Pandora",2015-10-02,5,"Five Stars compatability"
30392,"Pandora",2013-07-16,5,"Countless hours of enjoyment!!! Pandora finally allows my music tastes to be satisfied in a way no radio station ever could!!!!! Country, rap, classical, pop, rock, metal, and more all in an eclectic mix which fits my personality happy happy happy Did I mention that I even get Weird Al on my station? LOL"
30395,"Pandora",2014-04-07,5,"Is this for real?! Okay, so I am late in this whole online streaming thing in my 40's, But I was highly impressed with Pandora. Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy. I was hooked instantly. When they say you never hear a song you do not LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."
30398,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"Music it is great being being able to specifically listen to exactly what I chose with little to know interruption ! it is like never having to flip a record or turn over perpetually to hear all the same artist 's music!! It 's priceless!!"
30399,"Pandora",2014-01-05,3,"stops often to check R U listening YES. i WANT overnight radio. I like to listen to all night radio. This keeps asking me, R U still listening. I just want it to CONTINUE. cAN this be helped.???? I paid for the upgrade edition? So far this is unsatisfactory, due to frequent stops and starts."
30401,"Pandora",2016-12-18,3,"Three Stars yawn"
30402,"Pandora",2014-10-21,5,"Excellent! can not go wrong with Pandora! Some people might complain about the commercials, but for me it is worth it to be able to listen to the huge variety of music! Absolutely love it!"
30405,"Pandora",2016-08-14,2,"... listen to a specific song make this app almost useless to Ads and not being able to listen to a specific song make this app almost useless to me"
30407,"Pandora",2013-08-25,5,"The oldest streaming audio player I have loved Their database to map the music genome is impressive, they have been working on it for at least 6 years and although sometimes I get frustrated with a couple songs that end up in the mix, they really do share a lot of qualities that I would not otherwise bunch as similar to a specific artist.One of my favorite things to do with Pandora is very similar to spending time on wikipedia... You find one artist you like and make that a new station... soon you are 7 stations away but enjoying every step of the way!"
30409,"Pandora",2015-06-19,1,"NOPE NOPE NOPE Horrible app. Cant search for just any song. Seems to always play crappy music. I un installed about an hour after installing."
30410,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"I love PANDORA!!!!!! This app is amazing. There are thousands of stations, probably ten thousand songs. If you want music, buy this app. P.S. ALL of the stations are FREE!!"
30414,"Pandora",2016-06-16,5,"Five Stars it is fantastic! Thank you whoever invented it!"
30415,"Pandora",2013-03-03,5,"Raelly impressed! I have never used pandora before and downloaded the app because someone recommended it to me. Was suprised how I typed in an artist of genre and I got exactly what I wanted. I got current music that is hard to find on other websites and is not even heard on my local radio stations."
30417,"Pandora",2016-11-12,4,"Four Stars love the app"
30419,"Pandora",2013-11-03,5,"Pandora FAN! Oh how much do I love Pandora? I listen at work and I listen at home. If I had an unlimited data plan I would likely listen to it more but I use it on my wireless without a problem. I can mix my stations and add songs. I am a fan of Pandora!"
30420,"Pandora",2016-09-20,5,"Five Stars Great no problems so far"
30427,"Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"super app awesome selection of music.....whenever, where ever you are...."
30432,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Five Stars Great music at a great price."
30433,"Pandora",2016-12-06,5,"Five Stars awsome"
30434,"Pandora",2016-01-29,2,"Not Great! Not the greatest. Sometimes it plays songs that have nothing to do with any of the songs/artists that I have thumbed up . In fact, it does that a lot. The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle."
30437,"Pandora",2014-04-14,4,"Suprisingly Amazing Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you are looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I have found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can not seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."
30445,"Pandora",2016-03-01,4,"Wonderful music anytime. Great music anytime, any genre. I listen on my phone when I work out."
30447,"Pandora",2016-05-22,1,"Something better is needed if using kindle products. will not load correctly. Takes to much kindle storage."

30813,"Pandora",2013-02-10,5,"tbe best! I could listen to Pandora all day, whatever mood you are in, you will get the music you need! I especially love when it takes me back with all my throwback jams! There are some occasional commercials but no big deal. If you want commercial free you can get Pandora One! Enjoy!"
30826,"Pandora",2016-04-19,3,"Three Stars Not enough customization for me. I prefer Spotify."
30827,"Pandora",2015-03-03,5,"I love that they put similar music on your station I love that they put similar music on your station. I cannot always think of the songs I want to hear and it seems like they already know."
30829,"Pandora",2015-09-28,1,"Really?!? It does not play all the way through. Keeps cutting out. do not know what is wrong. Dissatisfied."
30838,"Pandora",2012-12-30,5,"Review for Pandora. free music= awesome. you can make your own music station based on artist, genre, or even individual songs. You have a limited number of skips, though so use them wisely. I recommend making many stations of the same kind of music and switching between them to minimize on skip usage."
30839,"Pandora",2013-09-06,4,"free music app I do not mind the commercials but wish it would stop asking if you want to download the free version Pandora One. I like the service otherwise, particularly because it includes lyrics for many songs and it learns what type of music you like."
30841,"Pandora",2015-09-26,5,"Five Stars Love Pandora. Like a station inside my head that picks music my soul is searching for, amazing!"
30843,"Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"Very nice! Great for listening to some of your favorite music. The ads do play in between songs if you are listening for awhile but it is still worth it. Lyrics are included, too, most of the time, and also a bio on the musician."

30860,"Pandora",2013-12-28,5,"Pandora!!!!! I love this app- it gives me the choice to ONLY listen to music I enjoy and cuts out the music I do not want to hear while enabling me to mix multiple stations together and discover bands similar to the ones I already enjoy"
30862,"Pandora",2013-03-05,3,"Good for test driving music Primarily designed to try before you buy.Limited options for listeningFound this while trying to figure out how to use the kindle to meet my kids MP3 player needs. They were not too impressed because of the limited number of times they could shuffle in a day."
30865,"Pandora",2016-01-22,5,"BEST APP EVER!!!! Awesome, it is the best thing I have seen. I would choose it over TV!"
30867,"Pandora",2016-05-24,5,"Fun. Easy to use Neat app. Fun. Easy to use, and download."
30874,"Pandora",2013-10-15,5,"Love this app at work It takes a while to load, but it uses less battery power then if I play the music that is loaded onto the device.Has a good shuffle, but can get stuck on a genre for a while, but its music that I like so I am not bothered by it."
30879,"Pandora",2016-10-06,5,"Five Stars I love it."
30882,"Pandora",2016-05-05,5,"Five Stars Great service. I now use Google Play however."

30897,"Pandora",2016-06-13,4,"Four Stars it is really good music to listen to"
30898,"Pandora",2012-06-27,3,"missing some features its nice, but not as nice as the PC version. you can not view lyrics on the app, and the ads are completely too much. the functionality to do other things is nice though. I am listening as I type now. and you can get to it in the notices button on the KF just like if you were playing music out of your library."

The variety of music never lets a day get stale and I even sneak these on during my 12 hour work days. The premium version disables ads and at least on the home version gives you higher quality audio. Audio quality is not noticeable on earbuds or low quality headphones, do not worry about that too much."

31022,"Pandora",2012-12-13,5,"A great app, hindered only by ridiculous amounts of advertising I love Pandora on my laptop, and now I love it on my Fire HD, too! It works great, but be warned that there are way more visual ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that is the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I do not spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run."
31023,"Pandora",2016-07-25,1,"One Star do not like would not work"
31026,"Pandora",2016-05-11,5,"Five Stars The music is great. Excellent selections."

31042,"Pandora",2017-02-23,5,"We love Pandora I do not know how I got along before Pandora. Mu husband and I listen to it all the time. I wish someone would come out with a radio that played Pandora music directly from Pandora. My husband is in a nursing home and would love to be able to listen to Pandora using one simple device that was not likely to be stolen."
31045,"Pandora",2013-09-30,4,"Ok I guess I wish I had unlimited listening on this, if I did I would use it more. As it is, I use up my time, switch to one of the other freebies, and then forget to switch back. So I only listen now and then. Advertisers are you listening?"

31084,"Pandora",2014-02-16,3,"okay This app is okay but I do not like how you have no idea what song is going to be played next. I think that Pandora should only have the songs from an artist on their station and that is it, no random singers."
31085,"Pandora",2016-07-23,5,"Five Stars free personalized music"
31087,"Pandora",2013-05-05,5,"Perfect I like the fact that I can add music to a genera or artist and can pick my own artist to shuffle in that mix. I have always like Pandora and am considering the upgrade to omit the adds. They are not bothersome, but sometimes you just want music."

31454,"Pandora",2014-01-03,5,"it is Pandora... I have been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you do not like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
31456,"Pandora",2013-02-11,5,"wonderful streaming Always user friendly. Wonderful music I could not choose it so well for myself if I tried.

Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe did not know about they offered a subscription service. The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent some do not even have bios yet or established artists you have never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - do not know, do not care. it is Pandora for me."

31562,"Pandora",2013-10-06,4,"Great app If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you. I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app. However, there are a few problems:40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week. that is a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you do not listen to as much as I do I am almost constantly listening to musicAds: not too bad, the limit is what gets me. What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.Sure, they give a couple good solutions. The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that is just for a month. Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right. If you have access to a computer, that is the best option in my opinion. However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer is not on and ready."
31564,"Pandora",2014-03-03,5,"Love Radio then Pandors This is such a great app. Especially since it is built into my new car radio system. Just plug the cell phone into the USB port and connect yo Pandora. Love this app and if course the music."

31735,"Pandora",2015-07-17,5,"Great music app! What can I say, who does not love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a thumbs up or a thumbs down which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you do not feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song.It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it.I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing.I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want.I am very happy with this app!"

32785,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"Typical of most Amazon Apps I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME New Age music. I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it. The Kindle, that is. However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right. Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers: the App is advertised as free , which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid. Pandora is advertised as free: download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE. Not so, of course: if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements. If I liked rock-n-roll, it would not be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever. Ads pop up all over the place. You can not see the album covers for ads. Oh, but wait: just pay the price, and the ads will go away! The price, by the way--at this point--is not that bad. What I resent is that 1 the station created by Pandora for my liking does not play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and 2 I was not told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay. I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle. The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words. The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer is not warned about ahead of time. As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that does not break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."
32790,"Pandora",2014-11-16,5,"Awesome I just love using this app! I listened 2 it when I am doing nothing or while I am bowling. Also when I am out doing things."

32965,"Pandora",2014-01-02,5,"Pandora Radio I enjoy Pandora because it offered the experience I wanted in a simple manner. I wanted to listen to the things I like in a radio fashion without having to select each song individually. Pandora offers that, just type in the desired artists and songs and listen to just them or click shuffle and get a bit of the whole group plus some recommended related groups. The component of liking or disliking the song that is playing is another fantastic feature that ensure only the enjoyable stuff gets repeated."
32969,"Pandora",2014-03-07,4,"Pandora The technology is terrific. I have not had the occasion to do much but try it out but I am sure it will be great to be able to listen to the different kinds of music."

32985,"Pandora",2016-01-03,5,"Awesome This app is the best music app yet"
32989,"Pandora",2013-07-07,5,"Pandora is not a free service! The app itself works farily well and has most features you would want. Pandora is never free! You either pay dollar 36/yr for Pandora One with no commercials on the screen or audio, or you pay with your loss of time, self dignity and sanity by allowing Pandora to force feed you audio and video ads between songs. Far from free. Yes, I know millions of Americans have been conditioned to tolerate intrusive advertising in their daily life but there is a cost to you. It has conditioned you to make compromises in your quality of life for no legitimate reason, just the corporate greed trying to leach upon your every moment of the day. do not let them do it. The 'free' Pandora is a preview service only for your introduction to the concept. Pay the dollar 36/yr for Pandora One, sending a clear message you value your time and dignity too much to be force fed advertisments. Reviews here keep saying there is no way to turn it off but on my Kindle Fire HD there are at least 3 ways I came across with only a minute's effort. You can hit the pause button during a song to stop it. You can explore the icons on the screen and find several ways to log off. Of course this means you must re-enter your email and password later so I just hit the pause button. If you do not like the occasional prompts that ask if you are still there, send the following message to Pandora Customer Support: I do not care what you pay in royalties, just charge us what you must to provide completely uninterrupted service like other services and satellite radio offers. Take charge of your technology, do not let your technology take charge of you!"

33829,"Pandora",2016-01-23,5,"Love it A great selection of music."
33830,"Pandora",2016-03-24,3,"Use Spotify, it is better anyway The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole. There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to. If you do not Pandora just stops, does not play any more music, but stays open. There is not any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app. You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song. The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."
33831,"Pandora",2016-02-24,5,"Five Stars Excellent"

34273,"Pandora",2013-12-29,3,"Good, but I do not use it much This app sounds great, but I do not really use it much since I have the Sirius/XM app installed. I would use it more if I did not have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about: 1 Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2 when I select an artist to start with, it seems they do not play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited. For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I will hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, I will hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others. So maybe this app is not for me."

34993,"Pandora",2014-05-19,4,"A great app This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I look on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I look at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It does not seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have."
34994,"Pandora",2014-09-25,5,"Five Stars I love being able to listen to music while sitting at my desk. The selection of choices is super."

35107,"Pandora",2012-11-15,4,"Update Looking for Exit... Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD? The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might Misbehave haha.. it is already misbehaving!! While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can quit instead of forceclosing, thank you.A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.If the ads bother you, it is easy to fix, just get the paid app.After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you are not it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."
35108,"Pandora",2013-08-10,5,"Pandora is a Great Internet Radio Service So happy with Pandora. I can listen to just about any song and it is free. Subscription, which frees it of ads is low cost. I do not mind the ads as the are very short."

35205,"Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"not defective after all I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nook app. However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time. What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it. That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened. Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be intuitive to many is not intuitive to me. Anyway, I am thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD. I would have rated it with 5 stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."

35462,"Pandora",2014-01-15,5,"Who does not Love Free Music? I have been using this app for years. These days, many people seem to be turning to Spotify. But Pandora does not hammer you with so much in the way of intrusive advertising. The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I am very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and do not like respectively, over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I am an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."

That is... the free version It has it is pros and cons as far as playing a song you dislike repeatedly over several similar stations but is still good at introducing new artists. I have noticed that the commercials play more often than they used to and it is getting to the point where I am starting to be annoyed by it, especially since it is the same commercial over and over and over again."

I am tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? will not renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they are focused on a young audience."

Like a song or band or genre? Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it will not play it again.it is not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."

39051,"Pandora",2015-02-18,5,"Pandora Review Five star rating for excellence in music. Two things I would recommend though. 1. do not put adds on, even if you haven't upgraded to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? that is my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the superb bookmarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! happy"

39135,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"No Regrets Downloading I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I have even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I have locked in Usher and it is been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. it is super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you do not like it will skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.I recommend this for ANY music lover, you will not regret it and it is free."

39240,"Pandora",2011-10-16,5,"Great app do not judge an app by international licensing laws that do not allow Pandora to stream overseas. I would imagine Pandora would love to stream outside the US. With that said, the app works as advertised."

39248,"Pandora",2014-12-23,5,"Five Stars Fantastic music selections."
39249,"Pandora",2014-07-26,3,"How wonderful life is with Pandora in the world I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke dollar ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too! happy"

39255,"Pandora",2015-07-15,5,"Pandora is AWESOME! Okay, I admit it, I am addicted to Pandora now. Before I got it I did not understand what the hype was....Why not just listen to the radio? I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I do not like. There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get 5 minutes worth of commercials at a time. When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth. It has become part of my driving routine. I also connect it to a stereo so I can listen while cleaning, doing yard work, or swimming in the pool."

When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire. This app keeps telling me I have timed out , even though I haven't listened to it for days. The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated. I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used! Some apps never stop running. This seems to be one of them. I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I could not get in to do that. If you want to pay for a subscription, you will not have this problem. But at least for now I am through with this app that counts itself as running when it is not being used."

41944,"Pandora",2013-06-26,4,"Like It a Lot I have been a Pandora subscriber for about 2 years. For me, it is well worth paying for and it is taken the place of our defunct stereo system. I do not use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music. I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group. Being introduced to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to. The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music. Overall, I am pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days. I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that does not work for me. So far, it is a perfect solution for me."

No biggie since it is free and great app."
41982,"Pandora",2016-02-11,1,"STUPID When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001 percent of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes.

Have used it for Halloween parties, holiday get-togethers, and my go-to station for work is one of my favorite motion picture score composers. I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I do not mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials. Love that I can listen to Pandora on my Kindle while reading, I can access it on my iPad while working out, and I can bluetooth-stream it through my car. I am always just a click away from my favorite music!"
41995,"Pandora",2016-11-02,5,"Pretty cool! I have only used it for a few days but it seems realy neat. I can just pick an artist type the name and teh musci from taht artist plays. Pretty cool!"

42014,"Pandora",2016-08-04,3,"Plays some music that does not match the station name. At first I loved this and still love parts of it.The issue that I have with it is that when I listen to a Station that I have.They are supposed to play music similar the the title of the station I am listening to.... it tends to play music that has nothing to do with the station that I am listening to.For example. I have one called Loretta Lynn Radio She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline,Kitty Wells,etc....SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music. ?? That is one of the songs that they played on the Loretta Lynn Station."
42027,"Pandora",2016-09-16,5,"LOVE IT and HATE IT Love every purpose intended.... but like when I run out of skips it happens to stations I have listened to in days.

42046,"Pandora",2015-06-26,5,"My favorite app! I use this every day! I absolutely love Pandora! I choose to add the monthly subscription it is like dollar 3.99 a month and the subscription is totally worth it. Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can not skip but with the subscription there are no ads. I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time. I have even found new artists and songs I did not know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix."
42056,"Pandora",2012-02-24,5,"got the droid x update Got the droid x update and now it does not shut down on me anymore! Love it! Works better than slacker imo"
42059,"Pandora",2016-11-14,3,"Same Songs I do not know if anyone else has noticed this, but I sometimes hear the same songs over and over again - in the same order. it is getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I do not want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I have only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it is usually a song I do not like and I am not holding that against them, of course. So I will put a thumbs down. But then I get the same songs all over again. it is quite frustrating."
42061,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Love Pandora! I have been using Pandora for years now and I absolutely adore the service! I must have 15 custom-created stations on it . Not only do i enjoy music I know but it also gives me the opportunity to hear new music and artists I have never heard before."

42071,"Pandora",2013-06-03,5,"pure amazing! This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!"
42074,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"SMOOTH JAZZ I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......A"
42079,"Pandora",2014-05-09,5,"Pandora is the best music program we have ever experienced. My wife and I chose this app. after we purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The variety of music with Pandora isthe best we have ever heard. Many of the album cuts by the artists you choose and others are cuts wehave never heard and it is always a pleasure to hear a song by a favorite artist for the first time.Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I are not looking.We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Roku and Smart TV's.We highly recommend Pandora for all music lovers and the variety it brings to your life."

42094,"Pandora",2016-08-11,5,"Pandora Music Best music app - listen to it every day. Option to block explicit lyrics is genius. Thumbs down on a song means you never have to hear it again. Thumbs up and you get more songs similar to that one. Absolutely brilliant."
42095,"Pandora",2014-10-28,5,"Love Pandora! I use this for when I am working on the computer or reading. A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time. Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode -- helps save on the battery. It also does not seem to interfere with the other applications -- although it will occasionally distort slightly not all the time when performing certain actions on a game or pulling up e-mail."
42101,"Pandora",2016-05-16,1,"Just my honest option on this app I prefer utube I did not like this app because when I used it I did not see video w it unlike utube it was boring just starring at my tablet watching the bands picture.i guess this is for music when ur on the go not for viewing"
42105,"Pandora",2013-03-01,5,"Music Major I love music. I love all sorts of different music.I love that I can go anywhere in my home, like the basement, garage, bedroom or take a shower, and still have the type of music play that I am in the mood for.From the '60s to Spanish Guitar to Eclectic, I have it all.I love the portability of it on my Kindle."
42112,"Pandora",2013-01-23,4,"music It plays good music but it is not very loud when the vol;ume of my kindle is on high. I would play it more if it was louder."
42113,"Pandora",2015-03-31,3,"play what I want ...not pandora The fact that Pandora continues to add stations turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that is what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great."

42120,"Pandora",2014-04-22,4,"Love it! I am still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. it is nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"

The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group."

42174,"Pandora",2016-06-23,1,"Needs to be updated there is no app for phone, it times out, the setup is confusing, and the box that cost dollar 200 does not show what bands are playing or channel. The channels,how ever, are amazing."

42188,"Pandora",2014-04-12,5,"The most extensive music variety on the planet! Pandora is quite simply the go-to destination when you are looking for a particular genre of music you can dial in and let play. it is never let me down for variety of newer and older favorites of whatever type of music I am in the mood for and the best thing is, you can take it anywhere. I like having it on my phone for portability in the car to hook up to my cars stereo or at home on my computer or stereo. Wherever you are, wherever you go, be it near or far, it is Pandora!"

42193,"Pandora",2013-06-26,5,"Good stuff I am not a kid and do not get too worked up about my favorite apps and do not spend the day staring at my phone if you know what I mean. I absolutely love pulling up Pandora's 'oldies' stations on my tablet, plugging in the earphones and relaxing while my wife watches reality TV shows. ;oPandora is a pleasant surprise."
42201,"Pandora",2016-11-20,3,"Pandora - do not find myself using this so I took it off so I can not rate it honestly. Gave it an average as its on the Apple apps so hope it is at least average. Sorry to rate like this. I have friends who do use Pandora and like it. I do not understand it and do not play much music on my phone."
42202,"Pandora",2017-03-19,5,"Love Pandora Love Pandora and how easy it is to customize. Even the free version is not that ad filled. Have it on all my mobile devices."
42204,"Pandora",2016-11-29,1,"Buggy waste of advertising space Locks up over and over again if I am even lucky enough for it to load and actually play music. If, by the grace of Zeus, it actually DOES start playing a song, it is almost guaranteed to crash with the first advertisement that comes through and slogs up my system resources."
42206,"Pandora",2014-02-21,2,"Not great. It is okay. If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit like it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."
42209,"Pandora",2016-05-03,3,"Pandora is a mixed bag It has quite a lot of music available for streaming, but in my opinion setting up your radio station is not very user friendly or intuitive."
42214,"Pandora",2015-12-15,1,"Wth happened to Pandora!!! I have been a huge Pandora fan loved it! I recommended to all my friends, well until I had to update it, the new update sucks! I hate the layout then it just randomly stops playing, I will think it is an add coming on but NO it just stops. Sorry Pandora WAS a loyal fan and listener but ill be finding a new radio app!"
42221,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"No, just no Too many ads, you have to pay to get rid of them. They put albums in your radio station even though I only want 1 song. it is a pain to set up specially since I already have my own music player with only so go I like. smug p I am deleting."

42236,"Pandora",2016-05-02,2,"Invasive permissions. I have been with Pandora from the beginning but as of late things are getting bad.Fix permissions. Stop asking for location data. This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be ok but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it is not fixed will swap to new app.If you have older versions dont updated."
42246,"Pandora",2014-01-05,1,"Too much legaleeze To be honest, I dropped this before actually trying on my new tablet. I have had a good experience using it on a friends tv quite a while ago, but the requirements from the company now...! Unbelievable what they require."
42249,"Pandora",2016-05-05,4,"Pandora! 😁 I love the Pandora app a lot, but it has so many glitches. Like one of them is that it will not let me delete my bookmarks. I tried to delete the app and reinstall it and see if that was the issue but it was not, please fix it! But other than that the design of the app is awesomes."
42250,"Pandora",2012-11-21,3,"needs work slow as balls sometimes to load new songs, have to restart a lot. seven more words are required there you go"
42254,"Pandora",2013-02-23,5,"music for free This is really great you get to listen to your favorite songs. if you do not like the song just put no and it will go to the next one. You can also do other things while you are listening to it. I am listening to it right now. I hope you like it"
42255,"Pandora",2013-02-04,1,"could not get it to work it kept wanting me to sign in and would not take my password and then they would ask for a new one and would not take it."
42262,"Pandora",2016-05-14,5,"Best Music App out there I love my Pandora App. I use it daily to listen to music. I can never find anything good on the radio so I always turn to my Pandora App for my number one source of music. it is super easy to use. Just type in a band, artist, or song you like and Pandora will suggest different songs and Artists that sound similar to what you have chosen. You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs that you do not like and Pandora will not play those any longer. The more you rate and customize your stations the more Pandora will play only songs that you like. it is perfect for me for when I am listening to music in my car, at the gym, or just about anytime I want to hear music. I have to say that this has got to be one of my favorite apps ever."
42267,"Pandora",2017-04-05,3,"Say,,,,, WHAT? Hmmm,???? I do not remember buying this. It must have come as a free app on my phone. Guess I will have to check it out."
42274,"Pandora",2016-03-16,1,"does not work I had 2 stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs would not play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that did not work. Ridiculous."
42277,"Pandora",2014-11-04,1,"FULL PAGE Ads the Instant You Join Ads the Instant You Join is bat s***e crazy in terms of over the top, customer insulting, crack addict revenue-ing. Ad Mad is taught now in Marketing clearly. Jam it down customers' throats like feed to the goose for enlarged livers for pate. I was not on for 1 minute before the full page ads stopped everything. Smaller old school Ad Banners are dead? FULL PAGE INTERRUPTS are of the new expected toleration level? Not."
42279,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Works great! I use this app on my kindle daily, it is perfect because it allows the music to be heard in a large room. I love pandora!"
42287,"Pandora",2013-12-02,1,"Worthless I can not log on to Pandora with this POS. we are experiencing unexpected technical errors. I can get in with browsers but not with this thing. it is deleted from my Kindle."
42290,"Pandora",2015-04-21,1,"too bad. Used to work. Now it will not load a single song on WiFi or LTE. I WAS a pandora one subscriber. No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can not even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best."
42291,"Pandora",2013-06-10,2,"sucks Pandora used to be really good, but lately, they have been making all these new rules and guidelines. It works well but it is hard to enjoy it because of these new rules. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!"
42296,"Pandora",2014-01-24,5,"Really like my Pandora. I was using the free Pandora with the ads and my husband told me about this. I really like that I do not have to deal with advertisements while listening to my music."

42298,"Pandora",2015-05-09,1,"This sucks I have heard a lot of great things about Pandora, so I thought I would try it out. The only problem is, I can not try it out. This will not let me sign in to any e mail account. Please fix this Pandora."
42299,"Pandora",2015-03-02,1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ... When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month. All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they did not get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I do not mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
42301,"Pandora",2013-02-28,5,"Great music As always, Pandora is my choice of what I want to listen to in music. I am able to choose good Jazz, Big Band music which is almost impossible to find on ordinary music stations. Thanks for providing this choice."
42303,"Pandora",2015-05-02,2,"sloppy work When it is possible to log on it is FANTASTIC. However eight times out of ten, the app and number 34;is having technical difficulties and number 34; or will not recognize the correct log in information. There is no mechanism to inform Pandora either via the app nor on the direct web site. I even contacted Amazon about the issue and there has been no impact at all. I would give it five stars if I could get in."
42305,"Pandora",2017-06-12,5,"Worth it. I love it. I no longer have to listen to music that I am not a fan of."
42307,"Pandora",2016-04-03,5,"great music app for any device. I love that i can have this app on my computer and on each of my devises and it will sync with all of them so all of my music is right where i put it. Pandora allows you to listen to music for free, with commercials. I wish that i could choose what song i wanted to listen to but that is OK. You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening. I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from. If you want to you can upgrade to Pandora monthly service for just 4.99 which is not a bad price if you listen to it a lot and do not want the commercials and you want more skips. all in all this is a great app for music lovers"
42309,"Pandora",2015-06-08,5,"Five Stars good"
42312,"Pandora",2013-09-14,1,"Love the music, hate the lie... the lie wins Seriously, I get 40 hours a month free ... A FARKING MONTH???Total BS IMO. No, there is no problem with the dollar 3 monthly charge on the 'pay side of the house but calling your supremely limited 'ad supported' FREE makes Pandora the Free Credit Report.Com liars of the app set."
42317,"Pandora",2015-05-08,2,"Issues navigating away from the app No lock screen controls anymore. When I navigate away from the app while songs are paused, such as using the phone or returning from the lock screen, it restarts the station does not continue playing the paused song. Very disruptive."
42322,"Pandora",2013-08-30,2,"does not work on kindle fire hd I love listening to Pandora. I was hoping to be able to utilize the awesome speakers on the kindle fire hd but the application will not load. When an update comes out to fix the bugs I will change my rating to five stars"
42325,"Pandora",2017-06-07,5,"Five Stars I love my Pandora....keeps me going on the go"
42326,"Pandora",2013-03-08,5,"BEST IDEA EVER!!! I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i did not have to listen to ads anymore. I have never been happier with any other music source. As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100 percent of the time. I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire, It is the best thing that ever happened to Music. Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down. If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like. It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved. The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using. It is just too great for words."
42328,"Pandora",2016-11-02,5,"Super Music makes everything better. Thanks, Pandora!"
42332,"Pandora",2017-05-03,5,"I love it. I enjoy old music from the 60th I love it. I enjoy old music from the 60th , 70, 80, and 90. They are beautiful to hear nowadays."

42346,"Pandora",2013-11-11,1,"it worked for a while When I first signed up for Pandora it was just fine. I was rating songs and artists listening to the music. About a week later I tapped on the Pandora icon and it did not respond. I downloaded Pandora but I keep getting the error message saying that they are having technical difficulties."
42351,"Pandora",2016-08-31,1,"Much better apps on the Internet I do not like this app. There are a lot better out on the market. I prefer Apple Music. Just my preference. Too many commercials and slow to load. Use a different one app is my suggestion."
42353,"Pandora",2014-01-06,5,"awesome I think this app is really great especially on kindle cause you can not download music. I really think we should have more apps like this!!!"
42355,"Pandora",2017-06-13,5,"Five Stars Excellent product works great"
42363,"Pandora",2015-11-11,2,"Too many ads everywhere! Good idea, good app, decent music BUT:1. You can not pick EXACTLY what artist or song you want to listen to. You pick the genre and HOPE it comes on...2. There are annoying ads all over the place...not only in the bottom but you also have to skip to none skippable ads too.3. You can not skip songs more than 6 times per stations."
42365,"Pandora",2017-08-17,4,"New music Use it to look for what is new"
42372,"Pandora",2015-08-06,1,"Worst app ever! I loved this app at first but now I HATE it I was just wanting to listen to music so I went on it and it started skipping song and then I shut my kindle all the way off and I turned it on again and it said and number 34;Were sorry but we have no more music for you try turning to another station. and number 34; So I did and it said the same thing please fix!"
42375,"Pandora",2015-02-18,4,"half music, half silence It will play a song of two, then go quiet for five to ten minutes. Then it will play a commercial, then start over again. it is very agitating. I tried to contract Pandora to fix the problem and never got a response. I have uninstalled it, the reinstalled it; it did not work."
42379,"Pandora",2015-12-05,1,"Fix this!! There is a major issue causing the tracks to skip through the entire song in a matter of seconds. A song will start, and it will jitter thirty seconds ahead every second until the song and number 34;ends and number 34; and it will continue with the issue through every song that follows. I do not know the cause of this, but I hope someone fixes this."
42385,"Pandora",2014-03-02,3,"Very good, BUT Pretty good music selection as others have noted. My concerns are operational controls that are weak or lacking on my Nexus 7.1 Android tablet.When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back. The big reason I miss the sleep timer is because when I am drowsey and want to turn Pandora off I have to almost wake up because of no quick way to shut Pandora off. It requires a bunch of taps to turn off. Where oh where is my sleep timer for my android tablet????"
42387,"Pandora",2017-04-26,5,"Thanks Pandora! I love Pandora sometimes it plays some of my fav songs and new songs that I like!it even helps me relax or go to sleep!I love Pandora.Creators of Pandora,if you see my comment thank you thank you thank you so so much!I think EVERYONE that loves music should have this ad.also Pandora take out the bad words music.Thx!"
42394,"Pandora",2013-06-20,1,"Poor reception I live in New Hampshire and the reception is spotty, at best. The songs are constantly breaking up. Not the top notch service I thought it would be. In addition, when the app needs to be upgraded, it requests that I register again and select a different user name and password."
42396,"Pandora",2017-03-06,1,"One Star sucks"
42397,"Pandora",2015-07-31,5,"Great sound from my Kindle. I have not use it to much yet but when I have I have enjoyed the music. I am able to bring up the music I want quickly and easily. I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I have downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it is on MY Kindle which is open I do not see the need of a password."
42401,"Pandora",2012-12-17,4,"Too many commercials Yes, I know, that is how they pay for things. But come on, commercials every third song or so? Wow. I remember using Pandora years ago on my computer - it was not that bad."

42552,"Pandora",2014-02-01,1,"SUCKS IT do not EVEN TAKE YOUR BIRTH DATE IT IS A STUPID APP AND A WAST OF TIME. IT IS SO STUPID A RETARDED"
42553,"Pandora",2013-06-05,1,"music This app is not the greatest only points you towards different stations not a app that you can listen to a particular song. If I want to listen to a station I can turn on the radio. The search browser is crappie to. would not recommend this to friends."
42559,"Pandora",2017-08-01,5,"Five Stars Awesome music."
42567,"Pandora",2014-11-29,1,"DO NOT LIKE THIS; HAVE TRIED TO REGISTER AND IT SAYS ... DO NOT LIKE THIS; HAVE TRIED TO REGISTER AND IT SAYS I AM USING WRONG EMAIL ACCOUNT, EVEN THOUGH GOOGLE SAID I COULD NOT USE MY STANDARD EMAIL"
42571,"Pandora",2014-05-04,4,"New Suggestion! Ok, I absolutely love this app, I mean I do not have Pandora1 and I still love it, minimum ads, free music, AND comedian stations. There is just one suggestion I have, and I am sure others will agree. All the time I accidentally hit the like or dislike button, and you can not undo it unless you change it to the other. My suggestion is that we are able to unclick the like and dislike button, but other than that it is great."
42581,"Pandora",2016-06-23,1,"do not buy I ordered 2 charms from this seller and both looked worn for lack of a better word. There was very little detail. Not happy and will only buy from a jewelry store from now on. Total waste of money."
42584,"Pandora",2013-02-08,5,"Great Music This app is very easy to use. I can receive the type of music I prefer at any time. The type of music is just endless."
42586,"Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"THE AD'S I love the pandora app. It runs fast and smoothly on my kindle fire HD. But every few seconds there is a ad pop up and you have to pay a certain amount of money each month so that you can have it ad free which i think is a rip off"
42587,"Pandora",2016-01-11,5,"Love it App works great on my Fire tablet happy I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews!"
42601,"Pandora",2014-05-01,5,"Great music I love that you can put in an artist or genre and listen, it is also great that when you give a song the thumbs up you get more music like it."
42605,"Pandora",2013-10-18,1,"Inflexible I found the inability to skip unwanted tracks simply unacceptable. Program was deleted. Amazon says I did not use enough words so I added this sentence."
42606,"Pandora",2016-12-16,5,"Pandora is a very neat and free streaming music service. I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system. I like the ability to enter the specific artist whose style of music you prefer and find artists few people have even heard of. I have the free service with few commercials that really do not bother me as they as so short."
42607,"Pandora",2016-06-11,3,"Play the entire price of music instead of cutting off, I paid for no commercials, is that cost too? I like Pandora, I even paid extra not to get the commercials, but why does the music cut off before it is not finished. that is a bummer, enjoying, the boom, it stops and goes to something else."
42611,"Pandora",2013-01-19,5,"Awesome Love Pandora, I can listen to all kinds of music all day everyday for FREE!! do not Get Any Better Than That"

42636,"Pandora",2013-10-08,5,"the best radio for music. ......A MUST GET!!! Pandora is amazing... it lets you choose the music that you want to hear and pick your own station's. And once you get more than one station, the songs that you like will be played more often."
42637,"Pandora",2012-10-22,5,"Pandora , musical heaven. Pandora rocks my world! It is soooooooooooooo easy to use and the selection of musical genre is amazing, everything from Celtic to Country, Bluegrass to Rock. Five stars is not enough."

42643,"Pandora",2013-12-26,1,"do not load I have the kindle fire HD and this app will not open for some odd reason, kinda disappointed. Please fix this if you can!"
42648,"Pandora",2015-10-21,3,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
42657,"Pandora",2013-10-14,1,"Terrible Well I would be able to listen to music then it stop working. Please fix it.Then I would maybe change it.."

42674,"Pandora",2017-03-18,5,"Five Stars can not live without it!"
42678,"Pandora",2013-01-17,2,"new version The latest version is cumbersome. The older version was so much easier to navigate. The old version kept my stations in alphabetical order. I did not have to navigate to a different to quit. I would not havr updated had I known this."
42681,"Pandora",2013-02-23,1,"Cant even use it. I can not even use it on my kindle fire hd. It said it was compatible. All it does is keep trying to log me in."
42682,"Pandora",2013-11-27,5,"Love Pandora! Love the selection they choose to play based on the channels I create. Not too many advertisiments like other apps. And also like that they do not censor the lyrics."
42683,"Pandora",2017-06-09,3,"The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free. However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music which was the reason I bought the item. There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists. When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song. The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good. I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."
42684,"Pandora",2012-11-22,5,"awesome have pandora on all of my devices. it has all of the music i could ever want. i like the shuffle feature too"
42686,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Difficult At times it is difficult so get to the music and operate the system. In all fairness, I am a new subscriber and am just trying to learn the system of operation."
42691,"Pandora",2012-11-20,5,"Pandora is an awesome product Haven't used this medium as yet but will try to access it from the gym.Music choices are great. I will take it to my exercise room and find it helpful."

42749,"Pandora",2013-11-03,1,"SMH. SO, I actually love when apps get updates, because I love to see all the new features that it contains. For this app, in particular...Well, let me first start off with this. I have been a huge Pandora fan, for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can not. I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I am used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS do not PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you are about to lose a customer, if you do not get it together."
42754,"Pandora",2014-03-06,4,"👍👎=👌 Because it jut throws out sings like some songs u do not like and then u use up all your skips but besides that it is good"

42761,"Pandora",2013-12-07,4,"ALMOST PERFECT. Sorry I could not give it 100 percent I am satisfied with the app. I never give anything a perfect score other than GOD. Music is the universal message."

42808,"Pandora",2016-10-10,4,"A good app to get lots of music A good app to get lots of music. A few too many ads perhaps but that is the trade-off for free. The thumbs up and thumbs down feature is also helpful to keep getting music that you want. Has everything I wanted including 60/70/80, classical, and old fogey music."

42836,"Pandora",2015-11-23,5,"I just love the music selection I paid the annual fee so I do not have the pesky commercials. I just love the music selection. The only thing I do not like is when I choose a song from a performer as a radio the song does not play. I have to wait for it to eventually come up. For instance I really, really wanted to hear Over the Rainbow by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my radio. Another song played and I never could get Over the Rainbow. Other than that, I love Pandora and love the ease that I can add it to my car, my tablets, phone, etc. Very user friendly."
42840,"Pandora",2016-03-07,4,"Intermittent Functionality Kills 5 Star Review This would be an excellent app except for the fact that every other time I start it or it gets an update it stops playing any music at all. Song titles and info appear for the expected duration of the track but no sound is played and there is not even an animation to indicate that something might be trying to play. When the next update arrives it functions normally again. Until the next time. Very frustrating."

When working I would give it 5 stars - the alarm feature is particularly a plus and when broken it disrupts waking up to Pandora. ..One other thing - Pandora One has promised to work on upgrading stream quality beyond full-blown computers and five years later it is DOA - disappointing."

43074,"Pandora",2012-11-21,5,"awsome This app is awesome. I do not know why everybody looks at the bad things and never at the good things. Enjoy what you can people. The only bad thing is that you can only skip songs 6 times per hour but still it is a great app."

I have been using Pandora for well over 10 years and I think it is the best. You can listen for free and get the occasional ad or pay a very fair monthly price and get ad free music with a lot of neat extras. I miss the days of AM radio with unbiased DJs and good music - the kind of music we listened to when cruising the boulevards back in the early sixties......Pandora brings that time back. Works well with bluetooth."
43099,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"Pandora's great! What can I say. I just discovered Pandora and I love being able to have just the music I want. there are some commercials but so what, not anymore than you would get on a radio station,if as many and you get just what you want."
43100,"Pandora",2012-05-19,5,"great! this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too. this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying. some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people do not know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and artists that you do not like very well. this costs dollar 40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora. I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
43102,"Pandora",2017-06-09,4,"Four Stars Somewhat difficult to navigate, especially if you are interested in concentrating on a single artist."
43104,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Great app for all kinds of music. We love Pandora. We listen to it all the time whether at home or on the go. It has all the songs of the 40s, 50's to present day. And any kind from Country Western. pop, R and B or what ever. Great app."
43107,"Pandora",2015-03-10,5,"Pandora custom radio Pandora is a very user friendly radio app. Its song library is huge, and the programming works great. This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you. it is important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise. I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists. This is an app I use daily."
43120,"Pandora",2016-07-27,5,"I love Pandora! I use Pandora all day long. I love a diversity in my music and I can change it when ever my mood changes. I use the alarm to set a sleep time, so I fall asleep before it turns off."
43126,"Pandora",2013-01-15,4,"awesome music app great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone, iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of 5 or 6 Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"
43133,"Pandora",2017-05-15,3,"Music, Music, Music Sound quality on a kindle is not that great. Also, if you stop thumbing, it shuts off."
43136,"Pandora",2017-01-01,4,"Love I love music and I love love love this app! Definitely recommend!!! It works very good I just wish that you could save songs from it and create like an album with the songs you saved so then you can listen to the music you like without needing WiFi. I would really love to listen to the music when I am on a road trip and my kindle is not connected. Other than that I am extremely satisfied with Pandora!"

43151,"Pandora",2012-04-25,5,"Free Music! If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour although it is not unlimited.However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora One for a dollar 4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive however, there is still a skip limit with Pandora One. There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for dollar 0.99. That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on for example, only on weekdays. It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a sleep timer that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes so that the app does not play music all night while you sleep."
43152,"Pandora",2016-02-25,5,"5 stars!! 5 stars! I love this music app!!"
43154,"Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best. The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet if they would reconnect at all. Pandora seems to have a very strong connection. Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music. It also does not inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements. Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
43155,"Pandora",2011-11-13,1,"Songs never finish I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I am very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
43159,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"love cause it has everything i want.i would reccomend to everyone.i have tried other ones and they play what i like."
43161,"Pandora",2016-10-29,4,"I love Pandora but... Pandora has an amazing selection of radio stations and I am so glad we can further edit them to our preferences! But I am saddened by the fact that if my kindle screen goes idle the music consistently skips unlike when the screen is active where it might skip once in an hour. Also different than my cell phone which does not skip at all. If it were not for that issue this would likely be a five star!!!!"
43164,"Pandora",2017-09-15,5,"Fan for Years I have been a fan of Pandora for years with my computer, my phone, and now my tablet. I get to pick the music, even if we have to go back to the 1940s to get the songs and bands that play real music, not just noise."
43170,"Pandora",2017-05-31,1,"Crapiest radio app ever. Its the dumbest radio app ever, when I am using my aunts internet its rlly good internet it says no internet connection. Please try again later. When I am at a laundry mat, no internet connection. Please try again later. My house, no internet connection. Please try again later. My parents house no internet connection. Please try again later. This app is the crapiest app ever. I do not think you should get this app. IHeartRaido is way better than this. Fix it. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
43171,"Pandora",2016-03-30,5,"Best music app by far Best music app by far. Easy to create channels for all types of music genres and navigation back and forth between them. I eventually purchased the upgrade so that I did not have to deal with listening to ads between songs. I highly recommend taking that route if you plan on using this as your primary source for listening to music."
43174,"Pandora",2016-09-29,2,"Pandora - I will Pass Pandora is my first streaming music experience. The more I use it, the more I dislike it. Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers. There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres. Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs. This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content. do not subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over. Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features."
43176,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"great for listening to all types of music this is a great music app. It allows you to customise the stations you wish to listen to artist. It is nice to listen to music without interruptions."

43193,"Pandora",2017-06-10,5,"Great! Great! You get just what you want, when you want it unlike AM or FM radio."
43195,"Pandora",2012-12-26,5,"Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire I love love love Pandora and have used it for a few years now!! You can not get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now and not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
43197,"Pandora",2013-09-23,4,"NOT BAD AT ALL Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc. And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night. Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.Still, I do not expect to use it very much. I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music. But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment."
43200,"Pandora",2017-10-29,5,"Who does not like Pandora? I have had it for almost 10 years ... Who does not like Pandora? I have had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I am in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I don’t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and they’re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free."
43203,"Pandora",2017-05-30,5,"Five Stars works great on my mobile device."
43206,"Pandora",2017-02-07,3,"Could use improvement I enjoy Pandora, but it could definitely be better. I do not like the loud commercials. They are extremely irritating so I either turn off the sound or turn off Pandora when they come on. Even more disconcerting is when I am listening to Jose Cura a nd other tenors, I suddenly get hit with Heavy Metal! Definitely not in my comfort zone."
43209,"Pandora",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars Pandora Rocks!"
43215,"Pandora",2012-12-22,5,"WORKS GREAT DONT BELIVE ALL THOSE HATERS This apps works great I can listen to music and play order and chaos online. It only stops because you have bad wifi and the commercial happen like every 7 songs to me ands there only 30 sec. I love it I can listen to all my favorite bands like The Ghost Inside, Parkway Drive, Carpathian, Stick to your Guns, and Killswitch engage. Get it who does not like FREE MUSIC"
43219,"Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"Pandora rocks...or pops...or jazzes...whatever you want! Pandora was recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional get started guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!"
43222,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Kindle Pandora App works great! The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD. I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian. Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy. Pandora definitely targets well."
43223,"Pandora",2013-08-16,1,"Does not work I have never been able to get this app to actually play music. It simply opens up a screen with the logo and does nothing else. Not sure whats going on."
43239,"Pandora",2017-01-02,3,"Some things ARE never ending. Although it is free, it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music, but then it shuts off to ask if you are still listening!!! Good music, and sounds like a radio with commercials, but stop asking if we are still listening, someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."
43240,"Pandora",2017-03-23,5,"Five Stars great music selection"
43243,"Pandora",2017-06-05,5,"I like Pandora to play when I am cooking or sleeping I like Pandora to play when I am cooking or sleeping, but it sometimes is hit or miss with the play selections."
43247,"Pandora",2016-05-17,5,"Music Site Of Choice I have used Pandora for many years. it is one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. it is not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. it is called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."
43252,"Pandora",2017-10-04,5,"can not go wrong With being able to listen and at the same time make your own channels"
43257,"Pandora",2017-01-24,5,"Best site for music I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
43259,"Pandora",2017-01-27,5,"Great Music I love this app, I use it all the time! Great way to listen to the music you love. Love all the music selection"
43261,"Pandora",2017-04-29,2,"New website stinks! The new site is awful! It is significantly more complicated to use, especially when editing stations. This now requires a four step process instead of one. How stupid is that?!?!? The new site wastes so much space that could be used for navigation purposes. Music and cost is the same, but the new site STINKS!!! it is like going back in time 10 years."
43263,"Pandora",2014-04-05,4,"For music lovers I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it. I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind. There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs. Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many. For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
43266,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"The greatest. I gave up the radio a long time ago. I have subscribed to Pandora for years. It is great to have on our Amazon Alexa . All I have to do is open the station I want, Alexa, Hillsong from Pandora . Then as I listen to the songs I tell Alexa, I like this song or I do not like this song . If it is saved as a like or a dislike I am building my own station."

43288,"Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes I have been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it is satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I am on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I am not sure if it is just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on highI have unlimited data, so it is not a problem for me. it is free so it is worth it but if you are thinking of getting Pandora OnePremium Membership that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it is a lot better in my opinion."
43290,"Pandora",2013-03-14,5,"Get this app! Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you will not regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
43293,"Pandora",2017-08-11,5,"Miles Davis Radio The Best! Fantastic Variety of Music!"

43304,"Pandora",2014-07-23,4,"Not a bad app, very easy to use and install Not a bad app, very easy to use and install. I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top 40 depending on my mood. This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical. Guess what? it is working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset."
43313,"Pandora",2015-04-30,5,"Best thing since the iPod! I have Pandora on my phone, on my Fire TV stick, and on my Kindle. I use it everywhere. I use it on my phone, when I travel, to avoid having to find a good radio station. I use it on my Fire TV stick while I am cleaning or cooking. Using the sleep timer on my Kindle, I can play one of my sleeping stations, which helps me fall asleep quickly. This is the best thing since iPods, for me."
43314,"Pandora",2016-05-11,1,"Prepubescent creation at best! Do not expect Factual information I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I have come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that is not about that artist? confused That fact is beyond Sloppy it is entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? confused So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."

43322,"Pandora",2017-01-06,5,"Favorite music Works great on the Kindle Fire. I love being able to choose music I enjoy and hearing music from my favorite genres."
43327,"Pandora",2013-01-08,3,"The leader is falling behind When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely loved it. However, over time, the stations became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music 10 hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced."

43342,"Pandora",2016-07-16,5,"YAS!!!! happy happy happy ABSOLUTELY AMAZE!!! I love it so much! YAY FINALLY AN APP THAT I CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC WHILE PLAYING A GAME WITH NO SOUND! I love how you can go to a game and just play it while the song is going! Only problem is the skip limit. Sometime when Work is playing I am just like SKIP! And then u ppl will not let me sad . So I have to go to another station. But that is just minor! ITS A AMAZING!!!"

43361,"Pandora",2017-09-07,1,"I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated This app is not what it claims to be. I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated. Have tried several times and it is a waste of money."
43366,"Pandora",2016-09-25,1,"Worst This is by far the worst music app I have ever used.I keep trying it to see if it gets any better, but no it only gatsby worse every time I try it. I tried it on my computer years ago and it did okay but eventually it just got to where it did not work.This time it worked and then skipped half of each song. Will not be trying Pandora ever again."
43367,"Pandora",2013-01-15,5,"pandora perfection pandora is an amazing service, as both a free app and a paid service. i downloaded the app and switched to premium shortly after less tjat 5 bucks a month! i use it every day and almost never use my skips. the stations are very well tailored and chances are you wont be skipping many songs."
43368,"Pandora",2012-07-07,1,"Excessive permissions and poor app performance made me remove it from my Kindle Fire! I thought it would be nice to listen to the radio when I was waiting for someone when I had a WIFI available. I did not realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version, and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data, modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I do not want to share that data with someone's server.Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle.* Network communication - full internet access and create Bluetooth connections* Your personal information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests, read contact data* Storage - modify delete internal storage contents* Kindle calls - read Kindle state and identity* System tools - Bluetooth administration, change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping* Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state* System tools - automatically set start at bootI just found the app to not work very well, not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio. I have deleted it from my Kindle Fire."

I like a wide variety of music and Pandora has it all. I upgraded to a premium subscription; very good price and worth the upgrade.

43424,"Pandora",2017-09-02,1,"Enough of the elevator music The ads are way louder than the music. The music times out too soon. I like to set it for long periods. The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's the seasons every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?"
43425,"Pandora",2014-08-22,4,"What a Find! I am a senior citizen and new to the idea of sampling music online. My tastes range from Portuguese fado and neo tango music to Brian Eno and Harry Partch. In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.I am not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me. Three cheers for this new-fangled technology, which is also intuitive and easy to use!"
43426,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"Great app loved it but theres just one thing.....read on I love this app. There is only one thing that is really makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I did not download.

43429,"Pandora",2016-05-19,5,"Your dream stations it is free, with only three or four ads per hour. You pick an artist and it sets up a channel playing music by them or in a similar genre. what is to complain about?"
43430,"Pandora",2013-03-07,5,"I love Pandora! I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I do not like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I do not think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my stations from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I do not know."

43516,"Pandora",2016-06-30,3,"I really expect high quality audio for streaming. I noticed Pandora used to stream 192 kbps for free with advertisement. Now it looks like you have to pay to get that quality. That stinks. When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps. Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings. it is like paying for satellite radio. Why would I when the quality is set so low? Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities. Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps. Otherwise, I will never pay for it. You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free. what is the incentive then? None."

Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! dollar 4.99 a month!? it is barely worth a lifetime membership for dollar 4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no are you sure screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership. Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click. It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on. I used to enjoy the free version but did not like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."

I have to say I am not jealous anymore. This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed: 1. Slacker 2. Iheart Radio 3.

I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa you get my drift.. so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I am being picky but it does get annoying when 4 times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."

43666,"Pandora",2015-09-04,5,"Lovin' Pandora Not a day goes by that I do not play my favorite artists on Pandora. Whether on my Kindle, my cell or my laptop Pandora is always there playing what I enjoy listening to and not what someone else likes. Even with the rare commercial breaks, its ok, because, it is RARE. I LOVE MY PANDORA!"

43670,"Pandora",2014-10-08,3,"I like Pandora. Use it everyday I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."
43675,"Pandora",2017-10-28,1,"great for a few years installed Pandora app for Kendle a few years ago. worked great until a few weeks ago. Now says it can not connect to Pandora. Tried uninstall.

43677,"Pandora",2014-03-22,3,"Not bad for free. I like Pandora because it seems to be a smarter program than most. When I type in an artists it does a pretty good job of giving me things I would/could like. The downsides are that it does not seem to reach out into the realm of eccentricity and expose me to new artists as much as I would like AND you can not choose specific songs to listen to or build stations from."
43687,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars thank you"
43688,"Pandora",2014-06-10,4,"Pandora I think it is wonderful to be able to access so many different types of music and even get a little background on the groups and see lyrics. The only thing that is needed to make this 5 stars would be more relevant music choices when you choose an artist. As an example I chose Beach Boys and the subsequent music will be a different style from the 50's."
43691,"Pandora",2016-03-04,1,"After trying their 60 day free trial, I ... After trying their 60 day free trial, I wanted to keep their paid service but was not able to. They took my credit card information and it was my understanding that I would automatically continue to receive the premium version. However, I went back to the free version and I was not even able to go on their website and activate the premium version. I sent several emails to them and no-one resolved it or even attempted to see what happened. In other words, they had a someone who wanted to be their customer but could not and still can not! Not the way to run a business."
43693,"Pandora",2012-12-02,5,"The Source for unlimited Choice Pandora is my go-to source for any artist or song that I want to listen to. In addition, you create radio presets/stations for your favorite artist, group, genera of music even comedian. each time you sign in, you can listen to your stations or create new ones. The possibilities are endless. Its free with some ads or you can subscribe for a low monthly fee of dollar 3.99 month or 36.00 a year.give it a try, Im sure that you will find your favorite song, artist or comedian."
43696,"Pandora",2015-01-07,1,"Good site, but app contains a virus! I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there is nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I will be looking for another app for my Kindle."
43697,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T!I!T!... GET IT!!! Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay dollar 4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and does not have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."

I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia and Phantom, classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! does not matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD."
43719,"Pandora",2013-09-17,5,"Awesome Music! I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can not loose!"
43725,"Pandora",2014-05-08,5,"Pandora At Last This app is so wonderful! I love being able to hear the music and comedy routines that I love without buying anything and without putting up with a D.J.

43733,"Pandora",2015-01-14,5,"What I enjoy in the evening with dinner. I listen to Pandora daily when my wife and I are having dinner. I like the thumbs up or thumbs down feature because when I give it thumbs up I get more of that sort of music. When I give it a thumbs down the music goes off immediately. I also like the wide variety of music available."

43737,"Pandora",2013-08-11,5,"Pandora I love Pandora. I have to say I like it better than any other music source. One can 'make' a radio station and listen to just the music you want. Anything you do not like, give it a thumbs down and you do not hear it again. After a period of time, it is all the stuff one likes to hear. Did I say I love it? Also have it on all 4 computers as well as my cell phone. It do not get any better. Life is good!"
43741,"Pandora",2017-07-19,4,"Nice good sounds ! Nice to be able to hear some of the old songs again, most of the radio stations do not really play 'oldies but goodies! Clue. it is not 1990's !"
43743,"Pandora",2014-12-28,5,"One of the oldest music services, this is the one I still use the most. It may not have as large a music library as some other streaming music services, but it has been around a long time and all of my favorite stations have long since been established through this FREE app. It will always hold a prominent place in my app collection!"

43756,"Pandora",2012-11-26,5,"Pandora is awesome. In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and do not have to sit through a few songs I do not particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible."
43759,"Pandora",2017-05-02,4,"Four Stars Pandora is a good application, I would recommend this application to anyone who enjoys listening to music."
43764,"Pandora",2014-03-10,5,"Wonderful App I have discovered so many great new artist using this program and my appreciation for music has grown! Plus, it is not just music.

43777,"Pandora",2013-07-16,5,"Good vibes! I love this app however, I DESPISE the commercials! Yet how can Pandora pay the bills if I do not pony-up for a subscription for commercial free listening...but does not that defeat the idea of free internet radio? Consequently, I will endure the limited interruptions...it is better than FM. I can select the style of music I am feeling without having to slit my wrist from being subjected to the no talent, lack of common sense, Bieber."
43782,"Pandora",2017-09-15,2,"Free but the Advertisements makes this not so good PandoraToo many advertisements and they come up where it is easy to accidentally click on the advertisements.Free is good, but not when they put advertisements where you can accidentally click on them."

43806,"Pandora",2017-08-12,2,"Three strikes, you are out Too many issues with the app not loading"
43811,"Pandora",2013-06-07,4,"Use it all the time Its pretty great, but there were soooooo many commercials and adds. I pushed through it, but THEN they limited the amount of time you can listen on mobile devices, and I drive all the time so at that point it was stop using it or pay the dollar 3 a month... I upgraded, and its better now but its still very irritating that they always do this are you still listening nonsense. My response is, NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE I am TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU JUST SHUT OFF MY MUSIC. I still use it constantly though so at the end of the day I suppose that should say something."
43812,"Pandora",2015-09-07,4,"Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs I have had Pandora on my computer for years. Recently downloaded to my Kindle Fire. Now all I have to do is figure out how to connect again to my bluetooth capable sound bar. Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs."
43814,"Pandora",2017-10-13,5,"Five Stars Very good app"
43816,"Pandora",2015-01-01,2,"Pandora often over promises and under delivers. Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works. If you want something more eclectic, not so hot. Or perhaps they are targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics. The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format. there is just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll. Of course, you can skip the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your skip quotient with the free version. Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters. I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with stations I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora. Do have to say that their Rockin Holidays Radio station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that gets it. Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."
43822,"Pandora",2017-06-12,5,"Finally. Some Pandora love. Finally. Some Pandora love. Lets just hope Amazon keeps up with the updates. If theres one app that should be updated when need be, its this one."
43825,"Pandora",2014-06-29,4,"A must for music lovers I love it when I can not sleep or want to hear new things. I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone. It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music. I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection."
43831,"Pandora",2015-11-06,5,"Free-Music-Streaming Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist. Also has a great ability to suggest songs that you would not normally listen to, but are a similar type of music as the playlist you are listening to."

43852,"Pandora",2013-03-17,2,"do not bother with phone app!!! Read below for a great desktop trick. Used to be the shizzle for the phone. Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream. WTF? And to boot, they are now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month. I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc. 40 hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads. You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review. On the pc you do not experience the above issues however, there is still a lot of ads. UNLESS . . . you know a trick, like I do. And yes, it is completely legal.For your home pc, Google Adam Haile Elpis . Click on the first hit. Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora. In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora. Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things. 1- it allows you to have unlimited skips. 2- it will not download any ads. In other words, it simulates the pay service.you are WELCOME!!!"
43858,"Pandora",2012-06-19,5,"I LOVE Pandora, and use it daily! I have been using Pandora as a paid member, for years since before the 'app' came out. Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I am in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I am in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it is MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service happy"

43862,"Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"Pandora is the best Here is a service that will play any song that is in their archive that you want to hear. They will even find similar songs to match to your interest. I started with Johnny Cash, and before I knew it through their recommendations I had many songs by many artists that they play randomly for me. I love it. And, they are adding more regularly. You can not beat this service and best of all it is free."

After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.lag time in between songs is usually pretty good not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection but overall not bad considering that I am driving through numerous cell towers as I am usually listening to Pandora. lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.Nice album art when its playing too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads and very easy to use command buttons."
43872,"Pandora",2014-02-08,4,"Thumps Up Music App I use Pandora because of the thumbs up down system and that the service itself is free. The app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens. Actually most apps today do not take this screen size limitation or scaling into account and that impacts my use of the app. Otherwise good."

Once it is downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you have created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone. Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you do not have to miss a step. Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there. Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web. But they are short compared to commercial radio. And you can always upgrade dollar 36 per year at this time and you will not hear any ads at all. The music will be higher quality 192K bits per second and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device."

44140,"Pandora",2012-04-01,5,"Reliable, good interface, and good quality Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned, I have nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I have experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strengthThe interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an i, which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. it is not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."

Pandora plays a wide variety of what I enjoy listening to the most, plus songs and bands I have never heard before based off the genre it selects from I listen to are very enjoyable. I am not a paid subscriber since depending on the device I am listening on has little very little to no commercial interruption. Like to see Pandora offer music videos as well, with and without a subscription."
44171,"Pandora",2013-12-22,4,"I like it I like the app of Pandora but lately they are giving a lot more commercial and sometimes when I am listening to their music start getting interruptions as lagging and is not my Wi-Fi, since I only have the problem with them but for a free app and music is good."
44172,"Pandora",2015-11-13,5,"The box that rocks I completely understand where the name comes from as I download so much music from hearing it on the App. It is Pandora's box and the elusive Rabbit hole combined. My wife and I both love it."
44173,"Pandora",2013-07-03,4,"Great app, has my favorite songs This is a great app, but i took the one star away because of the ads. They always get in the way, and as soon as I touch the screen, bam there is another one that covers the whole page. It gets annoying, and you have to pay like 3.99 a month just for no ads. Ridiculous. So yeah this app is better on a tablet or a phone with a huge screen so it does not cover the whole screen...but otherwise it is awesome. does not really lag unless it is having a bad day...Galaxy Express i437"
44174,"Pandora",2012-01-16,5,"Would be five stars but for one feature Updated:loses a star! Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web. This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already do not like Pandora for whatever reason, you are not going to like the app, obviously.Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle. Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the QuickMix station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser. Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars! Way to go, it is about time!"

I then upgraded to Pandora/One to take advantage of higher fidelity and eliminate ads. When I found I could get a Pandora download for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 I jumped at the chance. With the free app from Amazon I now have two sources for quality music: a fixed desktop computer and a mobile Fire tablet."

I like how they keep track of the thumbs up songs and make a custom station.I pay for Amazon prime music and use it most often"
44215,"Pandora",2015-01-30,4,"Good, but not great The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app is not quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting."

44250,"Pandora",2014-12-30,2,"it is now mostly ads with the occasional tune that does not crash. I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says Pandora can not find any more music, try changing channels on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it is recently become totally unusable as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it is it is same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."

44261,"Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Five Stars Great"
44262,"Pandora",2013-12-30,1,"FREE: HALF TRUE I loved the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you have ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I do not have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that is an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again for free I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was free and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a solution that would allow someone who had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I do not wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who do not use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information. it is a shame we could not work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."
44266,"Pandora",2014-03-25,4,"Made a Scarlatti channel, a Vladimire Ashkenazy channel, Rubenstein, Horowitz Lovely - all my favorite old school concert pianists, some lovely vintage recordings turn up as a nice surprise, and of course, Scarlatti wrote enough pieces to keep anyone happy for a very long time. Interrupted by loud commercials now and then, but it is free, so cannot complain, and if I wanted, I could purchase it and avoid the ads."

44276,"Pandora",2013-04-07,3,"Generally Fair I like Pandora because of there song veriety but the 3 stars is because1. Other songs show up more than the radio station Songs which forces me to skip then when my skips run out and a horrible song comes on I have to go to another station and listen to another station and deal with it again2. I have read reviews of Pandora and most songs are not complete only one song occurred that was itI am mostly taking the song issue more than the complete songsPandora stop picking your noses and fix these problems so we could keep listening and give you guys positive reviews its more simple than you think to do it I would be more than happy to delete and start listening to slacker etc"

44300,"Pandora",2013-07-28,2,"_ This app was an amazing adaptation of the web based Pandora. It was simple to set up and use and played a lot of good songs. The problem came when I logged out of it one night to charge my Kindle, it drains your battery very quickly and will not charge at all even when no music is actually playing, and I could not log in the next day. When I click on the Icon, the title screen comes up, but it will not load pass that stage. I tried deleting it and downloading the app again but nothing will fix it! I hope I am the only one that has this problem because it is really a great thing, but I just wanted to warn the next person who gets this that this problem might happen to them."

44329,"Pandora",2016-09-17,5,"Very good collection of songs and I do not have to pay ... Very good collection of songs and I do not have to pay extra for them. I like the format of presenting songs that I might find similar in nature.I learn about and might even purchase titles that I hadn't been aware of."
44332,"Pandora",2016-01-06,1,"Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth Was unaware I had even started a week-long trial, 3 month later I notice that my card is being charged monthly yet I hadn't used Pandora at all during that time period. I reached out to Pandora and they told me they would not refund any of the charges because of their Terms and Conditions. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Not going to use Pandora when I can use Soundcloud instead."
44337,"Pandora",2017-11-01,5,"can not imagine life without Pandora. Pandora is the greatest invention of this century. I love that it connects me to new music and artists. It is all I listen to at home."

44364,"Pandora",2015-03-11,5,"Pandora is better than YouTube This format allows me to listen to the music of my favorite recording stars without interruption. And I can not really comment about Pandora without saying that I find it so much better than YouTube which now employs the irritating practice of dividing albums into sections - sections which , when one presses PLAY ALL, do not play in their entirety."
44367,"Pandora",2013-10-14,5,"Music To My Ears! This app is perfect for when you do not have a lot of tunes stored on your device or you want to listen to something you do not have. it is a great way to discover new music based on what you already enjoy. The suggestions make sense and I am very happy to have this. Being an avid music listener, I tend to get bored of what I have easily. Pandora has helped me find some of my new favorite artists and discover old ones I have never heard of before. Great App!"
44371,"Pandora",2016-10-28,3,"I am disappointed sad Why can not I get this on my BlackBerry anymore? I am sad now. sad Yes I have an older phone, but do not hate. I like the app. Here lately it is playing too many of the same songs over and over. I might have to learn how to use the sleep function. The app is good at guessing what you might like."
44372,"Pandora",2016-10-11,5,"Definite must have for music lovers! I love having good music in the background while reading, studying or just working on any project and this app fills that need admirably."

44426,"Pandora",2014-01-28,4,"Pandora is Great My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it is just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it. I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I do not like as well. The pop ups are annoying and I understand I am able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget. How about discounts for seniors???"
44429,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Music lovers library Pandora is a wonderful way to hear the music YOU like. Whether it be a particular style or by a particular artist. It even gives you other music similar to the favorites you pick. You can set your IPad up in any room where you might be working or lounging and with a couple of clicks you have all the music you most enjoy playing for hours or just a few minutes if that is your choice. Great Stuff!"

44458,"Pandora",2013-03-26,5,"love it! i love this app! but only the paid version. the ads in the free version are annoying beyond words.i like how you can customize your playlists, discover new artists in genre you like.i haven't listened to the radio in years because I am sick of commercials and how they beat all songs deadby repeating them every 3 songs. so discovering new artists and music is now done with Pandora.i do wish they would allow you to skip an unlimited amount of tracks, esp when your a paid member.it does not seem fair to force you to listen to songs you dislike or are not in the mood for.i highly recommend Pandora!"
44461,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"tlarson1656 Pandora worked great until yesterday. None of my stations are available on my kindle fire HD. I had the same problem on my iPhone, but that is now fixed. When will it be fixed for the kindle?"

I am able to have several stations. some times it keeps playing music i do not love, but do not hate, but it irritates me after 3/4 song. Now, the advertising has gotten overwhelming the only thing is that Pandora radio is mostly music and half of the advertising is not heard. I do enjoy the new sleep timer, very convenient."

I strongly suggest that if u love music, down load this app I promise u'll love it. The only thing I wish good change would be for the user to be able to replay the whole song instead of just a sample or wait till it comes on again, but otherwise I love and I hope u love it too! Lol"
44472,"Pandora",2014-11-10,2,"Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream The latest update has eliminated song lyrics, a HUGE miss.Also, I was paying dollar 36 a year, dollar 3 a month, for Pandora One. Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream.Now, they want dollar 4.99 a month, a HUGE 166 percent PRICE INCREASE, with no annual payment option. Thanks, but no thanks.Given Pandora's limited song repertoire and excessive ads and commercials, it is just not worth it.it is time to move on. There are better options out there."

44503,"Pandora",2015-11-05,4,"Great Progfram My only problem is the lack of a timer. I would like to set it to fun for, say. 1/2 hour and then turn off. Then I could go to sleep to music.

44508,"Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"Outstanding must-have app I have been a Pandora fan since its very beginning, and had it on each of my BlackBerrys before switching to Android and the Droid Charge. It almost always picks mosaic I love from my seed songs and artists and I can not begin to tally the number of artists I discovered on Pandora.I have tried the copycat services, but they do not even begin to compare to Pandora. I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription. Out is definitely worth the dollar 35 of you listen even a fraction as much as ii d confused ut is the only service I pay for other than Sirius, but that is not really about tykes music."
44517,"Pandora",2014-02-23,5,"Great music service Haven't been using for too long maybe a 1.5 months, but already love it. The smart radio station feature is quite good. It gets better the more you use it."

44524,"Pandora",2015-01-08,5,"Most useful application I have ever used! Words cannot describe my joy with Pandora. I am constantly learning about new music I would never hear about otherwise. The paid version is well worth the price. By indicating what you like and do not like you channels will get more and more tuned to your taste."

No need to fix it, if it aint broke happy JUST DO IT!R"
44538,"Pandora",2017-08-23,4,"Four Stars ive had pandora longer than amozon and its allways been great"
44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about those ads, about those ads no music So when I downloaded this app, I found that it is conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone. I did not mind the idea of watching ads, because it is a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow. But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for. But that is not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad. I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you are given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well. Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you are not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like rewind ; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a like/dislike on the track. I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, did not take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I did not want to be hearing. In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I did not want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."
44540,"Pandora",2014-11-22,5,"Great app! What can I say? Great app!"
44549,"Pandora",2014-01-14,2,"Pandora I like the variety of music Pandora has to offer, but do not like the fact you are limited to how many times you can zip through songs within a specified amount of time. I also find, at times, it takes several minutes to log on to Pandora. When I want to listen to my music, I want it to be NOW, not later. Thus the reason for my two star rating."
44550,"Pandora",2012-07-22,5,"Love It! Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course, so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all. You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations. And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I have had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion. I also play it on my home computer. Its free and I love it."
44564,"Pandora",2017-03-14,5,"Easy to download music Love how u add other artists to my station"
44574,"Pandora",2017-06-19,5,"Five Stars I love the variety of songs."

44583,"Pandora",2012-08-30,5,"I love it I love pandora app because it has every kind of usic on it and if your in the mood for lets say, country, they have all kinds of country songs, even on the radio. If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can not pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and authorsput you can not pick the song. Pandora does not have station either, which I am thankful for."
44587,"Pandora",2016-03-29,4,"Four Stars This is a great resource for those who desire good quality-godly music."
44593,"Pandora",2016-12-22,5,"amazon Tap - Alexa is amazing and so much fun. She can answer almost anything with a clear and concise comment. I I love Pandora Media. It is one of only a few stations that plays Oldies but Goodies music for us senior citizens."

This app is so awesome, I was at a cookout with family and no one thought to bring music and luckily I had my Kindle Fire HD and downloaded Pandora. Instant music and the fun really began. Everyone was singing along, dancing, laughing and really enjoying the day. The day was great thanks to Pandora !"
44600,"Pandora",2014-03-09,4,"Great, except wanting to listen to one artist only. The only thing I wish Pandora would do is if I want to listen to a certain group, band or artist, it would only play that artist and NOT artists like them."
44602,"Pandora",2016-10-22,5,"Five Stars I love Pandora and listen only to Pandora."
44604,"Pandora",2012-08-04,5,"Amazing free music app I do not know what to say that probably has not alreadt been said in praise of PANDORA on mommy KindleFire. Name an artist and voila, you have a station that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot and I do you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a greatest hits album and often that is exactly where they come from.But hey, if you get bored with the repeats, quickly create a new station.This app can not. Be beat for a source of tunes for your KindleFire or other aneroid device."

44639,"Pandora",2014-12-27,4,"Great Premise-Needs A Tune-Up The premise is wonderful... if you like this, then you may like this. I have made a lot of stations for myself, However when I select shuffle the stations the program seems to play the same few stations that I started with, and along with that, the same songs from those same stations. If I could eliminate that glich, it would be five stars all the way."
44649,"Pandora",2012-04-28,5,"Surprised by the low reviews I finally loaded the Pandora app the other day on advise from my daughter. After reading lots of bad an so - so reviews, I was skeptical, but did not think my college student would steer me wrong.I created a variety of stations among different genres and have beenvery happy with all my choices and most of Pandora's too. I haven't had to give many thumbs down. Even stations I have created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!The brief commercial breaks are not a problem at all.If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have."

44706,"Pandora",2014-04-28,1,"Horrible Pandora is the most anti-consumer, anti-artist radio service the world has ever known.

44715,"Pandora",2014-06-06,3,"I am not to pleased. When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."

With a decent pair of headphones on the Kindle Fire, the sound is excellent."

44744,"Pandora",2013-12-27,2,"problem loading I was excited to see that Pandora was available for my kindle hd after being an avid user on my pc. I have become very disappointed with this app because of a constant loading issue. It will work a couple of times then it will not load. I have deleted/downloaded this app so many times it is becoming a chore. Please fix this! do not make me go back to iheart radio!"
44748,"Pandora",2016-10-27,5,"Five Stars Love it!!!"
44750,"Pandora",2014-02-07,5,"A great value of entertainment and serendipitous listening joy. Pandora is a joy to use and an incredible value for free with ads or for a small monthly fee ad-free. I love that I can create multiple stations , specify a few artists to focus the programming, and just sit back and enjoy the surprising and almost always spot-on results. A refreshing change from my downloaded albums, annoying commercial radio, and horribly repetitive satellite broadcast options. Love Pandora! Thank you. Pandora."
44751,"Pandora",2015-04-06,5,"A great music listening tool. I have Pandora on my laptop and my TV and truly enjoy listening to the genres of music that I select directly and indirectly on my stations. I recommended the program app, etc to family and friends this week. It is a great way to check out new music and artists you have not heard."
44753,"Pandora",2016-11-22,5,"Five Stars it is the best, have on all my devices, 6 plus Roku TV, Thank you"
44756,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"Awesome Music Experience!!! I upgraded to Pandora|One and I absolutely love it!!! Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I do not want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic! It is well worth the monthly subscription fee, and not nearly as expensive as other internet radio options. I highly recommend this to any and all music lovers! You will not be disappointed!!!"
44757,"Pandora",2017-09-13,3,"I have to have WiFi in order to use it ... I have to have WiFi in order to use it so I have yet to be able to use it all . Not even in my car and the car came with it !"
44763,"Pandora",2015-05-17,4,"Four Stars Great music app."
44768,"Pandora",2014-06-09,5,"A Great Music App I love Pandora and have been using it for years on my laptop and iPhone. it is best feature for me is the ease of accessing such a wide variety of music from every era and from many artists sometimes new ones that I have not been familiar with. It is easy to use and was easy even when I was a new computer user many years ago. It updates with new features on a regular basis and the updates are always value added without big format changes."
44778,"Pandora",2017-06-07,5,"The best music app on the planet so far Love it. Have it across all my devices."
44781,"Pandora",2013-12-19,5,"Listen All The Time works great on the Kindle, on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and on my computer at work. I love being able to make my own stations."

44783,"Pandora",2016-11-21,5,"I love this station Wonderful, wonderful station. Thank you and God bless"
44784,"Pandora",2015-12-18,5,"Five Stars Love it wish it was able to play offline."
44791,"Pandora",2013-09-07,5,"wish I knew of this earlier! I got the free version of Pandora and am loving this Pandora music experience, I listen to music via Pandora rather than the radio now because it is able to select music that I like. I can give it thumbs up or thumbs down to each music and Pandora will remember my preference."
44792,"Pandora",2014-07-21,5,"Internet Radio l like this app because it provides all my old school rock and heavy metal. You can create your own stations on any music you like and publish them for the community. What I really like is you get a bio about the artists you choose to hear. And it is really interesting on how they were formed, played together and made history. Pandora will select the song for you based on the genre you select. Great App."
44798,"Pandora",2015-02-06,4,"Great music Sometimes this shows you bands/music you have never given a chance. Turns you onto new stuff while listening"
44799,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Works Well I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I would get a message telling me they are experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there is a quit option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the quit option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"
44803,"Pandora",2014-07-11,5,"Pandora is the wise old man of music streaming I have been using Pandora since pretty close to when it first came out for PC. I got Pandora one a few years later...back then it was one of the only apps that did music streaming in the way it does, but even with newer services available from other companies. I still use Pandora . Love it"
44804,"Pandora",2014-08-20,4,"I love this free version I love this free version. Although, it may become worth it to get the monthly subscription so I do not have to listen to the ads."
44807,"Pandora",2015-06-22,5,"Five Stars Goodl"
44808,"Pandora",2016-01-06,2,"Does this app not work on Kindles? This app freezes up if we add a new station. Then when I reinstall it, it freezes up after playing one song. I have reinstalled the program four times in one day. It works fine on my ipad, but not on my Kindle fire. Is it me or a problem with the app and the Kindle?"
44809,"Pandora",2013-08-20,4,"choosing music I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to set up a station with my favorite artists! I am a country fan and while I enjoy all the different artists, I have ones that I really love and Pandora allows me to listen to them more often. I haven't explored all the options but am enjoying learning and listening. Thank you!"
44811,"Pandora",2013-11-14,5,"Customized listening I get exactly the music I want with Pandora's ability for the user to choose their own stations and listen to their favorites, as well as the regular broadcasts."
44812,"Pandora",2014-05-02,5,"Most Helpful I started listening to Pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists I picked, they would point me to artists I had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection. I will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard."
44815,"Pandora",2015-09-20,3,"I love pandora but..... When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."
44819,"Pandora",2014-01-09,5,"A music lovers dream app This app is designed for the true music lover. Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up. You program the music you want by artist and Pandora takes it from there by providing that artist as well as like-sounding artist. So you can discover other interesting artists you may not be familiar with or have heard their latest music."
44844,"Pandora",2016-05-19,5,"I truly enjoy the hands off approach to music I truly enjoy the hands off approach to music. I am a musician and love the selection of tracks, especially those from bands I have never heard before. great idea, keep up the great work."
44847,"Pandora",2014-02-28,4,"Great for the Most Part You can not complain about the price, but I would like it so much better if you did not choose other artists for me, or if you would at least allow me to weed them out. The best I can do is drop 1 song at a time, and that just is not adequate. Most of the music you offer, however, is really great, so I gave you the 4 stars.Thank you."
44849,"Pandora",2017-08-21,4,"Four Stars Ok"
44851,"Pandora",2017-02-10,5,"PANDORA I really love it. I got Pandora for my husband and he is very happy with the music that he selected."
44852,"Pandora",2013-07-10,3,"Pandora Thought it was free music? Not. I guess nothing much is free appson the Kindle fire, but I will deal with it."
44853,"Pandora",2017-05-17,4,"Four Stars I am using it, but I do not know how."
44854,"Pandora",2015-06-12,1,"Pandora could not fix the problem! Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone. I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working. I contacted them and they are unable to figure-out what is wrong. I am cancelling my service and going with another provider."
44855,"Pandora",2014-02-16,1,"Pandora I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password. I was not sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora. Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod"
44858,"Pandora",2017-06-11,4,"Relaxing! A convenient and pleasant source with or without ads."
44865,"Pandora",2015-12-03,5,"I love being able to customize my music I love being able to customize my music. Pandora is very easy to use, and you can skip a song if your not sure you want it or not at the time it first plays. Makes for great variety on road trips"
44866,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"Awesome app Love how you can add to or create a channel to fit your preferences."

44870,"Pandora",2016-01-08,2,"used to love it I love this app and would love it more. But lately it will not play any station on my tablet regardless of the upgrades or not... I use the lullaby stations to help my son sleep at night plz fix"
44874,"Pandora",2015-01-13,4,"Four Stars Difficult changing stations."
44885,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"So such better than it used to be Easier to use and the playlists I can actually listened to from beginning to the end"
44888,"Pandora",2014-01-04,4,"this app is awesome... my only problem with it is... the pop up advertisements, I feel like I am using NetZero from back around the turn of the Millennium. I understand that if you pay for a subscription that those pop ups go away, but in this day and age people need to save dollar dollar dollar any way they can, so why pay for something when you can keep the free version and just tap the pop ups away every single time they come up."
44893,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"Pandora Excellent! Love it."
44895,"Pandora",2014-12-07,3,"grrrr why does it do this????!!!!!! I love Pandora but... it keeps playing songs that do not even relate to me station I am listening to! So I am listening to Imagine Dragons raised and I hear Taylor Swift or Paul Cardall!!!! And it only lets me skip songs 5-6 Times an hour on each station!!! This is why I u, Pandora a 3-5!"
44898,"Pandora",2013-12-15,5,"Love Pandora! I listened for hours several days this week to the Christmas station, hearing wonderful songs, with some suggestions from me, while wrapping gifts and sitting by the fire. I love Pandora's varied choices for me. I am never bored, I often sing along, and if one they choose is not right for my mood at the moment, I can delete it and get another one immediately. The ads are few. And finally, its free! what is not to like?"
44899,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"awesome just pure awesome I love this app! After you have made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle which I love and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"
44906,"Pandora",2014-12-03,5,"Work great on Blackberry Passport Great app for fantastic music!!"
44909,"Pandora",2014-10-11,5,"The best option by far Pandora has the best stations I have heard so far and their website is wonderful to navigate. You can collect albums and songs from your favorites and they even have stations that are created through your favorite song or artist. I have Pandora on Roku and enjoy it through my television, computer and Kindle. I love the music. Music choices seem endless and if you want commercial free and ad free music, the subscription price is amazingly low."

44915,"Pandora",2013-12-10,5,"YOU NEED PANDORA!!! Hey you, yes you! listen up! PANDORA IS A MUST HAVE. I literally live on Pandora. I play it no matter what I am doing, it is on.

44922,"Pandora",2013-11-02,2,"I have deleted Pandora from my Kindle Fire HD. I started getting political and other advertisements that interrupted both my music and any games I was playing. I have not positively isolated the source of these ads. When I do that application will be deleted permanently and I may reload Pandora. I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT. I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it two stars. However, I will NOT have any application that includes advertising that is this intrusive on my Kindle."
44923,"Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Five Stars Personally care for Pandora more than iHeartRadio. I seem to be the minority."

44936,"Pandora",2013-01-02,3,"does not really play what you want I really enjoy listening to music and I like the idea that you could chose the artist you want to listen to. However, if I type a specific artist I hate the fact that you listen to one of their songs and then a different artist comes on. They do not play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. they will play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I do not really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music...."
44939,"Pandora",2013-09-14,5,"One of the nicest things Pandora is one of the things in my life that never disappoints. I have had no problem with reception on my devices. With it is astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections. In a lull at a recent party of mine someone talked about skating to a song and before you knew it we created a play list of the song and everyone was rocking and telling stories for the rest of the night."

I do not. get why people give this one star it is awesome cause when I put a band name it gives me the songs thar I want. Plus, when you want to just change it you do not have to get rid of the other radio, you could still keep it. The only thing that ticks me off is that commercials come up every 6 songs , but I am still giving this app a 5 star rating. do not ever listen to the people saying that it freezes or anything like that. So, get the app seriously, GET THE APP!!!!!!"
44942,"Pandora",2016-01-22,1,"not working Sometimes it will only play a few songs then stops then wont play none and sometimes it will not play at all ...I love Pandora its my favorite but idk why its not working on here ."

This app does not play sensored music, so its not great for kids under 13. But the app itself is amazing and you can create your own station and listen to that genre. But there is also another problem, the advertisements are outta control! Who wants to listen to dating ads every other song???? It told me that I can upgrade to Pandora1 for 3.99 a month and I cant afford that. so just listen to this review!!!!!!!! FROBRO OUT!!!!!!!"

Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served.Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions band name/song that you give it. it is awesome, and super customizable. Best thing is it is a radio station. it is a different constant mix up.also, stick your phone/ tablet in a ceramic or metal bowl. speakers"
45010,"Pandora",2012-09-05,2,"Unsubscribed to Pandora One Update: I canceled my Pandora subscription after they raised the price. Just not worth it to me anymore... Too expensive to get rid of the ads... I would rather just listen to the free version and deal with the ads.Former: I listen to Pandora every day. In the car, at the office, at the gym... There is simply no other way to get this much music for so little money. I force close every once in a while when I undock from the car or change power sources. Otherwise it is perfect."

45017,"Pandora",2013-07-31,4,"Great App I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you do not like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.it is great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app."
45020,"Pandora",2016-02-09,5,"Love this app Love this app! The only downside is it stops playing if you do not or can not interact with the tablet after so long. I was making cookies and could not touch the screen when it stopped."
45021,"Pandora",2015-08-06,5,"awesome You can like songs you can listen free you can search artist, it is like the radio but you can skip songs but only certain amount.

45022,"Pandora",2012-11-21,5,"For everybody pondering wether to buy it or not>>>> This app is amazing! For every hour you listen to Pandora Radio, you can skip 6 songs. So if a song you do not like comes on, you can skip it! Also, if you type in a band or something like Maroon 5, it will play songs similiar to Maroon 5 along with Maroon 5 itself. happy Get it! Also, the ads are usually every 3-5 songs. They are only 10-15 seconds long typically. They have ads so they can pay for the songs they play! Please get this app!"

45040,"Pandora",2012-07-20,4,"Almost Perfect The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it is extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a 3 minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you are on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it is a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed."
45043,"Pandora",2015-03-20,4,"I like this app I like this app. I listen to it everyday at work.

45054,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"Pandoria!!! I Love This App!I am Listining To It As I Write This Review happy It Gives You Free Music happy It Does Not Give You What You Want To Listin To Whenyou make a station...It gives you a song that is like it...I kinda like that though, gives you more choices to makewith your amazon card or itunes card.overall.... great app!!!"
45060,"Pandora",2012-04-02,5,"My dear Pandora It took me a while to really love Pandora. I do not know why. Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true. It really is as simple as that. Well, Pandora, I think I love you.I use this app on my Kindle Fire. I love just about everything. One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'. As far as I know, this app cannot do that. Also, hate the ads...but I deal with them for free awesome radio."
45072,"Pandora",2014-05-28,5,"cool app I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"
45073,"Pandora",2016-12-15,5,"Pandora is great It has all the songs I remember from great ... Pandora is great It has all the songs I remember from great times gone by. Thanks for the memories."
45078,"Pandora",2011-11-16,2,"Ads suck and the interface is difficult with them running. What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site."
45079,"Pandora",2016-05-25,3,"Too many ads. If u want to upgrade you ... Too many ads. If u want to upgrade you have answer too many questions. Yes should mean yes I want to upgrade."

45096,"Pandora",2016-01-22,1,"Stopped working Have had Pandora on my Kindle Fire for months and listened every night. Two days ago it stopped working and I haven't been able to get it to work since. Works fine on my phone. Very annoying."
45102,"Pandora",2012-07-12,4,"Love it but... do not get me wrong I love the fact that they play great music for no price at all. Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for dollar 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I do not want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up! happy"

45125,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"Five Stars A super App."
45133,"Pandora",2014-06-05,4,"Pandora met my expectations Although the learning curve is a little steep even I was able to get what I wanted. The music comes in a variety of genres most of which I haven't had time to explore. You can save favorite tracks, search by artist, track or song. I still need to spend more time learning how to use it. But I am very pleased so far."
45136,"Pandora",2013-02-13,5,"Great app... important tip for other users... I love Pandora. I love being able to communicate with other users in comments on songs and artists. I also love being introduced to other songs like those that I already love. tip : if u have run out of your six skips just switch from that station to another and back again. same effect of a skip. if Iyar to choose one app over any other to have, I would choose paandora happy have fun with the best app ever!!!"
45145,"Pandora",2013-02-26,4,"Pretty Good, One Problem. This is a great app, and I love Pandora. It introduces me to new songs similar to the ones I like when I search for my favorite bands. However, one problem recently came up. When I open Pandora, and my Kindle Fire locks, it will not unlock. I have tried holding down the power button, but nothing works. As far as I have found, it only happens with this app. If this problem is fixed, it would be a perfect app."
45147,"Pandora",2011-12-08,2,"Not Available in Panama I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire. The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio. To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.As you can imagine, I am not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face. Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.Omar Upegui R.Panama, Republic of PanamaCentral America"
45151,"Pandora",2015-03-22,5,"Eyeintheskky Love the the vatriety of music. The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you do not like. Great way to match music to individual tastes. Kudos Pandora!"
45152,"Pandora",2012-12-24,5,"Music is forever All kinds of music whether it is for you or your kids. If you are in the mood for romance or in the mood for up beat music Pandora is for you."
45154,"Pandora",2013-07-13,5,"Efficient control over what you listen to What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel. You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy. Lots of programs can play one group over and over. Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."

45168,"Pandora",2013-03-30,4,"Music to my ears.... I love Pandora...I did not give it five stars, because of those silly ads.. I know they have bills too, but they get soooo annoying!"
45171,"Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"My 3rd most used App. I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes."
45173,"Pandora",2014-02-12,5,"Best App Ever. Pandora is a useful app for listening to various types of music. The Genome project has been succesful in creating an app that generates a radio station specific to your taste. Unlike other radio apps that play just the populatlr songs i like pandora because it plays all the songs on an album not just the mainstream ones."
45175,"Pandora",2017-06-26,5,"Five Stars Always good music"

45192,"Pandora",2012-11-26,4,"Great app! This app is awesome! You get to listen to music for free! The only thing I do not like about it is that you do not get to pick your songs... you get to pick the station you made but not the song. You make your station by typing in a band, song or singer. Then songs will play and if you like them you push the thumbs up and if you do not push the thumbs down. This app is the best! You will not regret it at all."

There is an occassional advertisement, and when it does come it only last 30 seconds at the most. Its free to listen to so yes of course your gonna need advertisements to pay the bills for Pandora. Great songs, and so many stations avalible. I would definitely recommend this app if you would like to listen to add types of music for free!"

45276,"Pandora",2017-08-12,1,"Awful. Very disappointed ! I Uninstalled it ! Too many refusals for its ability to accept ! I found Pandora to be of no value. If i had paid for it i would feel cheated.The promise of liustening only to music i like is a lie.The stuff they offered when i asked for Mozart was stuff I would never even classify as the same genre. I can not even imagine what genre that stuff was part of. Very disappointed!I have uninstalled it. I might try spotify ? or some other music app.Very disappointed!If i could i would give it a rating of minus stars ! ! !VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! !"

The take-it-with-you Android app works beautifully.My only quibble is that it is hard to change your shuffle on the app, but whatever. It would be easier on a tablet, but for a mobile app, it is great. Thanks, Pandora-you are the best."

45367,"Pandora",2017-01-10,2,"Used to be a great app What was once a great app starts to spiral downwards. The same music gets played again after an hour or 2. No variety in music anymore. When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music."
45371,"Pandora",2015-07-26,4,"its nice just when you get it after like 3 or 2 days it starts loading forever but otherwise its really nice happy I like it because if I am running out of batteries then I can just shut my device off and it has a nice set up plus this should be for 8 yr Olds and up in my opinion happy"

45383,"Pandora",2012-05-08,3,"could be better.... Panodora is a really great app and plays po the music I want, but my advice to you would be not to like the songs you like, because it takes it seriously plays that song over and over again. I promise that if you listen to the song area times it will recognize that you like it and play it more frequently. It never plays the songs that you dislike ,though, and that is always a good thing happy"
45391,"Pandora",2014-08-22,4,"Pandora I am not too big of a fan of the webview used for Pandora, at times it is slow and a bit frustrating to use compared to Spotify and others. That said, I still like the music discovery of Pandora as well as the comedy station that is on there."

45402,"Pandora",2012-12-12,5,"why are there so many complaints? I love Pandora and not just cuz I am 11I did not change the User name it gives a great verity and when I like songs, it remembers and plays them again it learns what you like. plus, I do not even see slacker radio on the top free section. so tut should prove that Pandora is better than slacker.even though ive never listened to slacker"
45408,"Pandora",2011-11-09,5,"Let the music flow! Perhaps one of the best music services available. Pandora is a streaming music service that allows you to search for the music you like based off a particular song, artist, genre, etc. Pandora works by using the 3/4g connection of your phone or tablet. If that is not available it also can use wifi! This program takes the internet version and brings it into one small package perfect for the android market!"
45409,"Pandora",2016-01-08,5,"Great compromise for streaming music Pandora is a great compromise for streaming music. Although the free version has commercials, they are not that offensive or as frequent as the other streaming music of broadcast stations."
45414,"Pandora",2012-05-18,1,"FAIL! I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I am lucky if I hear more than 30 seconds. I gave Pandora the benefit of the doubt and waited until the latest update... but still the same thing. I am uninstalling. Pandora has lost another customer."
45415,"Pandora",2017-02-24,3,"Works with Uber I started using Pandora only because it is integrated with Uber, to allow customers to choose what content they want when using the car service."
45418,"Pandora",2012-11-21,1,"I will miss you, Pandora I am an old man. 61 years old to be exact. I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora.***5/23/13***I have returned to Pandora! They repaired the app. Sure, there are more commercials but that is ok. Try it, you can not beat the price. Few apps have given me greater enjoyment."

45428,"Pandora",2013-03-12,4,"Nice application If it were not for the commercials I would have given 5 stars. I like that there are so many different stations to choose from. And the options to skip a song if you do not want to listen to it is nice. Also the thumbs up and thumbs down option is great. Especially when you do not like a song so it will not choose it at random later."

45453,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"Great Music I love Pandora because no matter what kind of music you are into,you can get it on Pandora.I love old R and B and with Pandora I can plenty."
45454,"Pandora",2015-02-09,3,"would have gave 5 stars this app is great and all because it is free music. But when I try to skip the song; not only does it not skip; it pops up an ad and I have to go to another station and back again to skip."
45455,"Pandora",2012-10-09,4,"great /failing I just got this app and I am in love with maroon 5 the script neon trees and any other alternate band ...but sadly it just cut off and said ' sorry app has forclosed' or ' we are unable to play any more music under this station. please change stations' if this does not Starr to work in the next day ..DELETE! its a waiste if thatsvall its gonna do"
45459,"Pandora",2016-07-14,4,"awesome Great, but can quickly use up data"
45462,"Pandora",2017-01-13,5,"its great I like it it is really Good and you need to add more stations please I love Pandora so much."
45463,"Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best Personalized Radio EVER!! Pandora is awesome! If I am cleaning up around the house or hosting a slumber party for my little sister, Pandora always has the best stations to choose from. Today's Hits radiois hands-down my favorite. Its better than 92.5 or 93.3 on the real radio stations. Choose Pandora now if you love music and you think that stopping every 3 minutes to put a new song on youtube is insane!"
45464,"Pandora",2016-06-13,4,"Four Stars Really enjoy the tunes and there are less commercial interruptions than before."
45469,"Pandora",2016-06-13,4,"I love it though as advertised. Hard to give any free app more than 4 starts. I love it though."

45476,"Pandora",2012-12-22,4,"Good music. Nice job of permitting selection/rejection of desired music. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. There!"
45478,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Great Selection Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."
45484,"Pandora",2014-01-07,5,"Love it I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want. I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I am in for the day. I have my workout music on one station and I do not have to worry about skipping thru the songs."
45486,"Pandora",2016-07-15,4,"Review The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's."
45489,"Pandora",2012-01-12,5,"can not understand. I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."
45493,"Pandora",2012-10-08,5,"Excellence in Every Way! The absolutely best music service available. I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres. Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week. I just love Pandora!"
45497,"Pandora",2012-03-30,4,"Love it happy I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I do not like a song, just put thumbs down. But it is kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials happy"
45498,"Pandora",2013-06-10,5,"Lexi: Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."
45500,"Pandora",2016-02-09,1,"not too happy do not enjoy the concept of signing into an app on my BlackBerry. Was not working well w the z 30."

45523,"Pandora",2017-05-17,5,"Five Stars This is just what it should be!"
45525,"Pandora",2017-10-12,4,"Good enough for me. Short of five stars only because of the constant streaming interruptions."
45526,"Pandora",2013-08-08,3,"keeps crashing I love this app! in fact i listen to Pandora on my computer as well, however this app has been crashing alot lately! It will just stop when I am listening or will say it had an error and needs to close. Hopefully the next update will fix this. I am using this app on my HTC Rhyme"

45576,"Pandora",2012-03-07,5,"Dunno why you hatin. I dunno why everyone here is saying it sucks on the kindle fire. Its awesome on the KF and the music comes out very clearly and smoothly. I have never had to deal with a force close with Pandora and although commercials do occur they are not as constant as many people lead first-time Pandora users to believe. Do not fall to the lies children!!!"
45578,"Pandora",2012-11-16,4,"Could be a little better The android app does not let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I do not like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!"
45581,"Pandora",2016-08-23,4,"Works great, great music Works great, exposure to new music with similar aspects of what you like. it is a great feature to expand your groove."
45582,"Pandora",2012-04-15,5,"AMAZING!!!!! Pandora is so much better than the iheart radio app. it is simple. fun. and when I want to makemy own radio all i have to do is type one song that I like and then it is like it reads my mind because it gives me all of my fav. songs. amazing. if you have a doubt about buying this app do not. it is totally worth it. makes me feel so good."

45592,"Pandora",2012-07-18,5,"how do you not have this already? this app is awesome. works with Pandora online and you can sync so your stations online are available on kindle. needs confirmation that you are still listening about every 3-4 hours. stays on without screen so you can listen longer or at night. does have ads play but it is maybe a couple an hour. small price to pay"
45597,"Pandora",2014-01-02,5,"Free music and great channels I really enjoy Pandora. The ability to create or choose channels is outstanding. It is also on my Xfinity cable service. My channels go from light classic to smooth jazz, folk,blues and even opera. I wish I could get it in my car..."

45607,"Pandora",2012-07-26,5,"I love it! Thanks to Pandora, I have been introduced to a whole new world of music! It takes what songs you have liked, then finds other similar songs. I have found so many great songs due to this app. I do not know why people are saying that it forces closed, this has not ever happend to me and I have had the app for a while now."
45608,"Pandora",2013-12-05,5,"excellent this app is the best. Just put in a song you like and it will play that song and songs similar to it. You can create lots of stations - pick some of their own/hardly Any commercials - just a very cool way to rock out to tunes. Love it"
45612,"Pandora",2014-06-10,5,"Great Music Choices I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I am at work. there is such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste. The songs play more clearly than my radio in work which tends to fade in and out because of being in a high office building. I would recommend this application to people of all ages."
45613,"Pandora",2015-12-23,2,"I used accidentally deleted dosnt work anymore So I had Pandora I tried to log in again but it says my password and email is fake."

So I would so its a ok app!!!"
45631,"Pandora",2012-01-31,5,"awesome on kindle fire this app loads nicely and is very easy to navigate. it is great to listen to music while reading to drown out distracting noises like the tv. create multiple artist or group radio stations and enjoy the music. it even has a shuffle function. the ads are short and far in between so not a nuisance at all. love, love, love this app."
45632,"Pandora",2014-12-18,2,"Very annoying! Also there are more and more ads keeps cutting out when I am in the middle of workouts. Very annoying! Also there are more and more ads! Will be switching to my own playlists on phone memory"

I do not want to pay to upgrade so I am stuck. that is the bad news the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps"

45652,"Pandora",2013-07-09,4,"I Love It! Often I like music, but can not identify the artist. This app allows me to do that. In addition, it provides me with like artists; music of the same genre or by the same artist which I would not necessarily seek out. I love these features."
45657,"Pandora",2012-07-19,5,"P. Beck I adore Pandora! Every day I meet new talented artists I have never encountered before since creating listening stations as diverse as Early Latin Jazz to New Age Instrumental and Liz Story to Bluegrass.What a delight to find music appropriate for the holiday seasons, too.Thank you, Pandora!"
45658,"Pandora",2011-12-21,5,"Pandora is an awesome application! Pandora is the best of the radio applications. It is free and works very well, even in the car!Anyone I have shown this application to has been very impressed and installed it immediately. Congratulations on a job well done to the makers of Pandora. As a reward, I signed up for Pandora One. Look into it. You will not be sorry."

45672,"Pandora",2012-09-30,5,"I love this app! I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I have also discovered some new artists that I have never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up."
45680,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"I love Pandora, listen all the time on my kindle I love Pandora , listen all the time on my kindle fire"
45681,"Pandora",2012-12-10,1,"Adds freeze kindle I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you are not actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come."
45683,"Pandora",2012-05-13,2,"can not view bookmarks this is a great app and all but the one thing it is missing is viewing the bookmarks. there is absolutely no options to view your bookmarks. I want to check out the songs and artists that I bookmarked but sadly I can not. Please Pandora fix this issue on your app in order to make this app great again."
45685,"Pandora",2013-12-10,1,"PANDORA IS HORRIBLE Pandora is horrible!! Its slow!! It laggggs really bad. I wanted to purchase Pandora 1 but its not worth the dollar 4 a month to listen to silence!!"

45694,"Pandora",2014-12-31,2,"Poor quality! If you do not upgrade and pay for it, the music is intermittent even if you are not on any other sites at the same time.Poor quality!"
45695,"Pandora",2013-04-26,4,"meh I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me"

45711,"Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"loved it till recently. plays one song and freezes. i have to quit close app and reopen....just to hear one song and Repeat! Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution."
45720,"Pandora",2013-06-24,5,"Music,Music!!! I love this app. I can hear all the music I want all the time. I put in an artist and there is the music. I am in love with this app. Being as it is free, you have a lot of ads, but that is ok with me, because it does not stop the music."
45721,"Pandora",2014-03-18,5,"love love love Absolutely the best if you want to hear your favorite music and definitley worth upgrading to listen commerical free! Lets you listen to so many different genres of music."
45722,"Pandora",2014-03-10,1,"to many pop up adds the music is fine , but keep getting pop up adds for every entry I make. I think I will try other sights for tunes."

45731,"Pandora",2013-05-26,5,"LISTEN UP! !!!! This is a good app but the app wont get you to your exact song. This app is not that organized but plays reallly good songs. This app allows you to skip up to 6 songs each station your on. This is a great music app I highly reccomend it."
45734,"Pandora",2015-04-06,5,"AWESOME If you love music you should get Pandora. I love Pandora you should get it. You will love it. BEST THING EVER!!!"

45749,"Pandora",2016-03-28,5,"Incredibly diverse music library, everywhere you are, for a pittance! I must have music as much as I need to breathe. At home, at work, in the car, while I do chores inside/outside, read a book, shower, go to sleep. No time for collecting a library, Pandora can do it for me and let me modify to near perfection."
45751,"Pandora",2012-12-19,1,"how to ..... how do i specify my 4 digit date of birth i mean im using a kindle fire how specific can it get? it only lets me enter my date of birth in number 's no spaces,forward slashes and no periods so to register how do i do that anyone with a kindle fire know how to?"
45756,"Pandora",2012-02-20,5,"OMG The best. Even the free version is great. You barely notice the ads, and the commercials are few and far between and short. Just give it an idea of what you like thumbs up and it takes it. If you do not like a song, thumbs down, and it goes away. I actually turned off the Tv and started listening instead."
45761,"Pandora",2013-01-13,5,"Why you be hating this app is awe it shows your cool little music stations. updates will come and go new stuff will happen like youtube. the only thing that I do not like is the pop ups. because a ad for a blow up doll came on the screen for my mom confused serioulsy pandora"
45765,"Pandora",2012-09-30,1,"ARE U KIDDING ME?! whenever you make a radio station it play barely anything u want and plays mostly random music. example: my Hollywood undead radio is playing tech n9ne Stevie stone and worst of all Toby Keith country music on a rock station W...T...F! DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS CRAP"
45772,"Pandora",2012-12-11,5,"I really dont understand Why is every one complaining about the commercials? Do you guys realize that Pandora makes virtually no reasonable profit from providing this FREE service? Where else can you listen to the music of your choice for free? The radio? Come on people cut these guys some slack."
45775,"Pandora",2015-04-10,5,"Love it Pandora is fabulous. You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music. It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time."
45793,"Pandora",2014-12-13,1,"too many ad's Way too many ad's and did not have some stations I was looking for. Spotify is way better they have less ad's and more music"
45803,"Pandora",2013-08-01,3,"it is ok! I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it is better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist"
45806,"Pandora",2017-11-13,5,"Works Works"
45810,"Pandora",2011-12-05,3,"permissions Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application- tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates. I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information, or why it has to be pinged so frequently. I understand that they need general location data for advertisements, but up to the minute is completely unnecessary. What is this company up to?"
45815,"Pandora",2012-11-30,5,"it is free so try it Ok I love this app sure it stops SOMETIMES and that is only if you have put your electronic to sleep for a while so it thinks you fell asleep so it closes down and it got update not to long ago so try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please!!!!!!!!!!!!"
45816,"Pandora",2012-12-13,3,"it is OK Like the stars say it is okay but it really makes me mad when in the middle of a REALLY good song and it crashes. Now I used too use Pandora EVERYDAY but now it gets on my nerves... I am think about a different music app... It TRUELY is a shame..."

45831,"Pandora",2014-02-03,4,"pandora I think that Pandora is a great app and would recommend it to anybody but the one thing that pisses me off is how after you skip a couple songs they wont let you skip anymore"
45833,"Pandora",2012-07-03,3,"this app annoys me because when ever I am lissening to more than 5 songs it tells me this station is no longer able to fetch songs then I try and create a new station and it does not let me! !!!!!!

45850,"Pandora",2012-12-30,4,"Good but.... I have been using Pandora since I downloaded on my kindle fire and it does have good quality of music when it wants to play. It seems it recently has been fixed. hopefully no interruptions will occur again. I hate it when it forcloses."

45862,"Pandora",2013-12-30,4,"Could be better I would like more choice for artist not just their popular songs, album list. After listening you begin to hear the same songs over and over again almost like commercial radio."
45864,"Pandora",2014-06-23,4,"Better and Better It just keeps getting better. Constantly making improvements. Pandora exceeds all expectations for quality and ease of use. Two words: awe some!"
45871,"Pandora",2014-03-30,5,"One of the best apps ever. I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy. The ads may be annoying, but you can update to premium, or just deal with the ads. Either way, it is still one of the best apps ever. Definitely recommend you getting this. Why not? it is free!"
45873,"Pandora",2013-05-05,5,"AWESOME!! My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I reccomend this."

45878,"Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"Oh so sleazy. Where should I start. 1. The app only works 45 percent ofthe time - it force closes or drops a song. 2. They put banners over all the buttons so you cant like skip pause etc. Oh and get this; the close button on the ad does not work just sends you right to the advertiser's site. Bravo, Pandora."

47251,"Pandora",2017-04-16,4,"Awesome I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that is really annoying when it is one of my favorites... otherwise it is Amazing!!"

47261,"Pandora",2013-06-28,2,"Poor pandora Pandora has good music but the commercial's after almost every song is awful! It ruins the listening experience. They need to figure out another way to make money!"
47262,"Pandora",2016-07-16,3,"Great for the most part Great for the most part. I can live with the ads in the free version. Some of my play lists, blues, ended up with Christmas songs I could not get rid of. Satisfied"

47295,"Pandora",2012-12-23,1,"wow really pandora so my music cant be fetched on any station now. really Pandora? not one single station can play music not even when I close the app and reopen OR shy down my kindle and restart"
47297,"Pandora",2013-04-29,1,"IT WONT OPEN!!!! All I wanted to do was listen to some music while at the hospital. So I downloaded Pandora. AND IT will not EVEN START!!!!!! Fix it."
47299,"Pandora",2012-11-18,1,"Pandora WAS great Pandora was once a wonderful way to listen to music. Now between every couple of songs there is a huge pause. Not seconds long but minutes long. Then there is an ad. I do not mind ads but I do mind the minutes of silence. I get that they want you to upgrade and pay them but if the free version with ads is this poor then they should only offer the subscription."
47302,"Pandora",2012-02-07,1,"NO I downloaded this for my kids that I babysit l. I added a. baby song for toddlers and I' m sexy and I know it can on!"

47308,"Pandora",2011-11-23,5,"Love the App, even better if you pay the dollar 36 a year I have had a subscription to Pandora for about 3 years. Before it was so I could use it on my computer, but now that I have it on my phone I love it. I have created a variety of stations, and enjoy the new music that comes up that I might not have thought of before. If you do not like the song that comes on, just vote it down and it will not play again.Those complaining about the ads, there is a simple fix - buy the subscription. It is only dollar 36 a year, well worth it."
47312,"Pandora",2013-02-14,5,"Love Pandora . If you are use to Pandora you will love this app. Pandora will let you hear music and create stations. I am a Pandora user and this app works fine."

47322,"Pandora",2012-09-24,1,"GETTING WORSE Used to be good, but has evolved to play too many ads, ads are too loud, ads take up most of the screen. Would buy an ad-less app, but they do not sell one; they sell a monthly ad-less subscription. LAME!"
47323,"Pandora",2011-11-15,5,"Free radio that you program dynamically! How could anything free be any better? I believe this is worth paying for if the adds bother you. You will find similar music to what you select and may find artists you were not aware of."
47326,"Pandora",2012-10-07,1,"1 star because it dose not let me enter my birth date and so every tin Elmer I try It dose not work and that is why I hats it"

47419,"Pandora",2016-05-04,5,"great!! Awesome app"
47421,"Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"spotify is great Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It does not limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let us you play whole albums and let us you make custom and endless playlists."
47422,"Spotify",2016-07-31,5,"Love this app I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
47423,"Spotify",2017-04-04,5,"Novice I love, love, love spotify !!!!! I am 71 years and no very computer literate, if I can learn Spotify anyone can. I have found songs I used to listen to 55 years ago."
47424,"Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"The ony music app you neec I love this app. I have tried them all apple, amazon, pandora and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I am finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
47429,"Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"Great app! I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to."
47434,"Spotify",2016-07-13,5,"Better than Pandora I switched to Spotify from Pandora because I wanted to be able to choose the songs I wanted on my playlists while still having the option to create radio stations like on Pandora. They have a huge variety, so pretty much any song you are looking for, they will have. The radio stations created based on artists tend to play a lot of the same songs over and over. I use the paid version so I do not have to listen to ads when I workout, and I will continue to do so."
47439,"Spotify",2017-11-12,5,"Five Stars Love the variety!"
47442,"Spotify",2017-01-26,5,"Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle.

I can hear anything I want and any songs that I happen to love, but the weekly discover playlist keeps me coming back because I am incapable of finding new music on my own."

47454,"Spotify",2014-10-15,4,"small bug otherwise great app there is a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it would not let me share to Facebook facebook specifically. I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. would not want an app that only has pop, rap and country sticking tongue out love it"
47456,"Spotify",2016-03-02,4,"Good App I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it is a good application."

47510,"Spotify",2014-12-14,4,"very pleasant I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood. Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."

You can also put this on your Kindle and the music will play in the background as you use it."
47519,"Spotify",2016-05-13,5,"Love offline option Spotify often has new albums soon after their release. Also artist radio and topical playlists fit my folky/alternative preferences. Much of the content is available for listening offline with premium. I am hooked."
47527,"Spotify",2016-01-15,5,"excellent For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I did not want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. it is worth it"

I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash think of that what you may because I just went to emøtiønal røad shøw yesterday June 18, 2016 so hehe. But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you do not have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you are listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they will not play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic. I am awkward just get the app."

47756,"Spotify",2015-10-29,5,"Works really well and provides and awesome service! Greatest music app on the planet! I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user student and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I do not regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you are like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.*One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it does not have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content and do not want to monitor it closely that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I do not know a workaround."

47758,"Spotify",2014-07-17,2,"I can not find the premium What I do not understand about this app is why I can not get the premium. it is very stressful when I am trying to find the premium and the kindle Appstore keeps telling me it does not exist. Every time I want to skip a song after I ran out of skips it pops up a reminder to get the premium. But how can do that when the Appstore says it does not exist?"

48012,"Spotify",2015-01-11,2,"I did enjoy the music collections once I found them Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an X or Quit it is well hidden.I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100 percent signal strength, telling me no internet connection. Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.If you enjoy apps that require in my opinion a lot of interaction and seem heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It was not for me."

It amazes me"
48080,"Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"The only reason for four stars The only reason I did not give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song."

48120,"Spotify",2014-08-04,5,"Best music app if you have limited cellular data on your phone I thought I would never leave Pandora, but someone made me try Spotify and I haven't looked back since. You can do a radio feature, but even better than that is that you can download the songs that you like the most, so you are not wasting your cell data plan.

48220,"Spotify",2015-10-03,4,"AWESOME The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 is because you can not listen to the music offline unless you pay like dollar 10 a month....Other than that, I think Spotify Is one of the best music apps ever!!!😆😆😆"

48237,"Spotify",2014-07-13,4,"Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music, however desperately needs Chromecast support. Also, needs to add support for up to 5 synced devices because the cost is bordering on too high. Strongly considering the Google Play Music streaming service but for now the catelogue is not as extensive."
48243,"Spotify",2017-01-09,5,"my point of view this app named spotify is perfect when you need to listen to music ,it is the best music app i ever used 😁"

Things that you can do on your pc but not tablet, like rearrange your downloaded playlists by artist for example. It can be annoying when try ing to find that one song in a list of hundreds."
48248,"Spotify",2016-01-25,5,"Awesomeness for Spotify Music Spotify Music is a great way to listen to music for me because I get to listen to artists and albums, or create a playlist of my favorite songs, and it is perfect for my tablet as well."
48249,"Spotify",2016-08-17,5,"Favorite Music App Solid user interface, with a massive selection. I especially love the related artists feature. It does a lot to help you find new music."
48250,"Spotify",2016-03-06,4,"Best service, but acceptable app. An excelent service but the app must need improvement do not have many play options, is hard to find the playlists, the options buttons are too small, and a few more things."
48254,"Spotify",2017-10-16,5,"Five Stars Great even with the ads."
48260,"Spotify",2014-08-21,5,"Sweet app Spotify is possibly the most useful music app I have ever used. It is easy to find new music, browse old music, compile playlists, and listen to other people's playlists with it. I am so happy with the quality and speed. No complaints except for the infrequent and short commercials, no bother though."
48266,"Spotify",2016-07-26,5,"Music it is great"
48269,"Spotify",2015-09-12,4,"Great app! I love using it for my music! I love using Spotify! Even though I do not have the premium yet, it is still great when you are using the free version. The only downside is not being able to save music for offline use, otherwise I would use this 24/7"
48284,"Spotify",2016-04-19,4,"Great Variety New music is usually available the day of release depending on the artist. I listen to hip hop of all the decades as well as their gym playlists to stay motivated!"
48290,"Spotify",2014-08-19,4,"step it up a little bit Great set up and everything but my sister got your offline free trial for 30 days and only got it for a week. Also it got kind of annoying when all of a sudden the adds started coming in at random times when my songs were on shuffle. Other than that it is a really good app, and I give it a thumbs up."
48291,"Spotify",2015-09-25,4,"AWSOME! but one thing. Ok cool, but why pay to get offline music?! I mean when I got it I thought and number 34;COOl A OFFLINE MUSIC APP! and number 34;Ok let and number 34;free at least 2 months and number 34; offline music,then 5 🌟's. ok? Thanks."
48294,"Spotify",2016-09-20,5,"Love it!! I absolutely love spotify!!! There is nothing out there like it! All my music in one place. number MusicLover number Loyal Customer!😁😁😁"
48296,"Spotify",2016-07-21,3,"I liked it, and I still do. Somewhat Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi unless you had premium, and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.it is made me happy in the past, but lately it is just disappointing me."
48299,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"A great way to learn my songs on guitar. I have had Spotify a very long time, as these type of apps go. I do not like random playlists. I want to hear the songs I download."
48305,"Spotify",2015-02-11,4,"good but can be better. Pricey after Intro deal One of my favorite music on demand apps. Lots of music . I just wish the music search was more like searching for a song on YouTube. Where you can type whatever lyrics you know and it matches. Spot iffy does not have this search tool on par yet with you tube ."
48307,"Spotify",2017-01-11,4,"Good app Good app for artist you love Wish they would generate playlists with other similar artists though."

48321,"Spotify",2017-05-12,4,"Album Magic I really appreciate the ability to discover full albums of artist that I am interested in."
48322,"Spotify",2016-02-25,4,"Good but should be cheaper for premium I really like this app but I think that premium should be cheaper or free that way if someone does not have the money to pay nine dollars a month then they have to pay less."
48323,"Spotify",2017-07-04,4,"Awesome It works great, but, you have to have WiFi for it to play music. Plz make it so you dont have to use WiFi."
48330,"Spotify",2014-10-29,3,"it was all right, IMHO I really did not like searching through songs and albums to find the music that I like Eagles, Doobie Bros. Boston, LED Zep., and etc. to set up a play list. If I have to go to that length of time and listen to the commercials, I might just as well set up a playlist on my Kindle."
48333,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"Mostly Great! I love this app! I use it almost everyday. The only concern I have is that sometimes it will quit working and uninstall itself from my device. Other than that the app is definitely worth getting."
48334,"Spotify",2016-04-04,5,"Amazing Spotify is easy to use, and is always ready to show you a song they recommend. There are charts that show you different types of songs. I would get Spotify anytime."

48351,"Spotify",2014-08-06,5,"Hear Any Song in a Matter of Seconds I have used a lot of music apps - Pandora, iHeart Radio, Tune in, etc. - but never one with such amazing search speed, ease of use, and nearly instantaneous playback. Old, new, even rare, obscure music --this app has found every single one I searched for and started playing it in only a few seconds."
48352,"Spotify",2015-12-12,5,"perfect I recommend this because it is great for researching on the web and listening to music in one device instead of using other technology for one and having to use another device for the other"
48354,"Spotify",2016-06-15,4,"Four Stars Really enjoying it"
48358,"Spotify",2017-04-28,4,"Four Stars My son likes it but without add!"
48362,"Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"Good I loved it because it gave me various types of music I could listen to, but I was kind of disappointed that you can not listen to them without internet on the road for free you must pay. But otherwise it has good quality, but it may not give you all the recent songs."
48368,"Spotify",2015-04-02,3,"frustrated Is it just me or has anyone else notice that the ads are getting worse? Because ever since i updated it I get 3 to 4 ads in a row and if i leave the app instead of watching the video my spotify app gets all froze and i can not do crap to unfreeze it"
48369,"Spotify",2014-08-14,5,"Software is Great! We love this app. It is very easy to use and the music selections are great. So far the software is very stable and fast."
48370,"Spotify",2016-03-14,5,"title here I really like how the adds are really short. It allows for a short break from the music, and them to get their quota without taking away from the experiance"
48374,"Spotify",2016-09-12,4,"but so far so good. Wish it was easier to select the songs ... Still getting used to it, but so far so good. Wish it was easier to select the songs you want, but it is not a hassle either."
48380,"Spotify",2016-10-02,5,"Spotify is pretty cool. Useful, easy, clean. Pretty much any song I have searched for is here. Lock screen UI is streamlined. I enjoy it a lot."
48381,"Spotify",2015-03-03,5,"Good but I need help... it is a very excellent app! No bugs so far. But I was wondering what happens when your trial ends... Do you have to pay? Or is there just more adds I can deal with adds. I would appreciate if you answer my question. Thanks again for this awesome app!"
48382,"Spotify",2017-07-13,4,"Stop removing features Bring back lyrics!"
48394,"Spotify",2014-08-04,3,"Okay. I love spotify, but you should not have to pay for anything on it. Like downloading music so you can listen offline. Why not just switch to pandora? Even though spotify is good, it only deserves three stars. It could earn five stars from me if it would only let me listen to music offline for free."
48396,"Spotify",2016-03-08,5,"love this app Love this app it has all the music that I like so far and I have not been disappointed yet if you want to here great music online or off then this is the app for you."

48913,"Spotify",2016-03-21,5,"love it My new best friend"
48917,"Spotify",2016-08-29,2,"Disappointing functionality, terrible stock playlists/stations. Was pretty excited to finally nut up for a paid music service after using standard Pandora free since it came out almost 10 years ago. I was attracted to Spotify for the offline playback, since I lIke listening to music while camping and traveling in the backcountry miles away from cell service. I started downloading all my favorite music, making playlists, and using the app right away. I was never in love with the radio, and browse functions, as they felt clunky and not very intuitive. But i was making my own playlists so that didnt bothet me too much. All was working well until it was not. First the radio and browse functions started working even more poorly and then not at all, then Spotify would freeze up, and I would have to close the app occasionally and restary. Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone. It still works fairly well when its actually working, but it freezes too often. The soft buttons to navigate through the features are too close and mistakes can be made too easily for efficient party dj type playback. The stock radio stations have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on making your own playlists, and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundreds of songs saved to my phone which may be causing the freezing, still unaccpetable. But that is only half of my gripe. Navigation is awkward and the app is in need of remodel. I think they employ millenials to put together playlists, I haven't found a decent one yet. I was truly excited for this app but sadly I most likely will cancel if things are not improved."
48920,"Spotify",2015-09-22,5,"great app this is a great app for music you just have to make sure that the artist is with them. one thing for them to work on though is for users to able to pick a song and play it whenever."

49894,"Spotify",2014-11-03,5,"I Love Both the Service and the App I love music of every genre, from the Jesus Music heydays in the 1970s and 80s to classical to American blues. Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I do not remember why, but it made sense at the time.So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs in general. I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended. I will live. I am happy I have this.Anthony Trendlanthonytrendl.com"

The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small Less than 17 songs?, it would start throwing in random songs, as though you would created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I will make a playlist with a single song because, well, that is how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the suggested songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there was not enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it is still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market."

51763,"Spotify",2016-03-25,5,"Totally Awesome! I do not do reviews often, but I have to speak up for Spotify. If you love music, like I do you have to get spotify. I have NEVER paid for the upgrade or Premium Service of ANY APP before until now. I was lucky enough to get in on a 90 day free trial for Spotify over the holidays and like WOW!! In a few days, my free trial will end and I fully intend to subscribe to the paid Premium Service, not just for me, but my whole family. The free version needs to offer a little more freedom so people can really see how fantastic Spotify really is. If you do a free trial, anything less than a Premium subscription is just a tease and actually depressing."

However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it. I do not think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app. It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well. Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums. Very nice. Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now. One thing I do not understand is how this service is available for free. It does have a few commercials, VERY few. It just does not make any sense to me, but I am not complaining. Really nice service or app or whatever you call it. I think it is great!!!"

54350,"Spotify",2016-03-02,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download I love that amazon has apps to download. The apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200 HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those filler channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar guide interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it is mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you are bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you are into some of the cable channels, you will notice a decline in program quality. If you are a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have those other 100 channels I really do not watch , and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

I can find music by mood or era, and discover gems I would have never come across by just a simple search. The feature of following other members' extensive playlists is a great way to reconnect with music that has been forgotten over the years. Spotify is not just a steaming app. it is an experience for a musical connection that I haven't found anywhere else."

It lets you CREATE playlists. It lets you SHARE the song...Spotify has done an excellent job. Although Amazon seems to suck for not having the top app and games like Clash of Clans, everyone can find a way to do that. But exclusively to Amazon, Spotify gave its users the abilities that no other app store is capable of.All the negative reviews are lies. it is probably something the user did to their device over timeyou know what I am talking about.I totally recommend this app. Free music for life! Not very many ads, either, which is nice.Enjoy!"

My children and I share music lists as well as my friend... the magic to choosing a music service is commitment... Pick one and stick with it... choose a model that suits you. The pay version allows you to skip through as many songs as needed to get where you want, the free version after you skip a few it makes you listen to a full song. There is cost associated to the music for the spotify people, so I get that. If it could read my mind, and spur my memory I would give it 6 stars..."

I wish they had access to all musicians and all songs, but their lists have come a long way since the first time I used the service a few years ago. The only thing missing is the ability to easily move a song from one of my playlists to another. Adding a Move to option in the drop down menu of each song would be a big plus. Also, I do not mind watching an ad every 30 minutes to have this service for free. happy"

56009,"Spotify",2015-06-16,5,"Spotify Embodies The Best Technology Offers Just a few years ago, listening to songs or a genre of music of your choice, meant purchasing lots and lots of music. Here's how I will put it: Spotify makes me feel rich because l have access to almost all the music that l can think of. And the best part is the cost: which is free. Love it when l and you win as we do with this app. I wish most other basics were just like Spotify! Perhaps a day will come sooner than later that disrupt things so that life become an affordable luxury --as Spotify has done for music! Great app!"

56512,"Spotify",2014-12-15,5,"People do not understand this amazing app. This app is simply amazing. it is musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a station or mix and that feature is decent. The algorithms are not great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that do not want to pay for premium service, you do not have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I am aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you do not need to pay dollar 9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they do not email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I have had my account for 5 months and I do not think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. happy"

56593,"Spotify",2015-09-23,2,"It WAS good till the update messed everything up. Spotlight was by far my number 1 music player until they updated it. Now it is basically Pandora, which sucks. You choose, skip, or listen to a song when you want to. Unless you pay a whopping dollar 10 monthly dollar 520 a year!, all you can do is shuffle play one genre. that is it. So dumb."
56594,"Spotify",2017-03-29,4,"Needs to update it is music I am listening to Spotify as I write this, and as a whole it is a good app, even with the new update. There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. do not take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I do not appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it is a good music app."

57091,"Spotify",2014-11-23,2,"Good, but I am not paying. I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, 750 song on several playlists that I use a lot but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation really, Spotify? Really? but I should not have to deal with that. I realize that I am not paying, but I should not have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I do not mind the ads, that is what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I am worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is in my experience an amazing app."

57428,"Spotify",2015-10-10,2,"I Thought I could trust You I have been using spotify for a couple years, for free. Basically as soon as it was out I was using it. Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to I do not listen to music often only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says and number 34;only with spotify premium can you do this and number 34;..... I have never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I am really upset sad I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I am not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. sad"

57473,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"Not Worth It I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can not choose what song you want to listen to it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can not exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can not see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it is a song you do not like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you do not throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and do not put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes"

58185,"Spotify",2015-07-22,5,"This is genius! Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since sold this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs if I am not mistaken that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you will not have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it is going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you do not want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have disposable playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what is the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

I just can not understand how they expect someone to pay for this service when it has so many malfunctions, for me anyway. For example I have to log in and out so it does not freeze up, and I have to turn WIFI on and off so it does not freeze up. This is on Multiple computers so it is not just me. Why would I pay for that especially 10 a month.I could get Amazon prime with music/TV/movies/STORAGE/shipping for 99 a year or I could get a spotty service like Spotify for 120 a year, you be the judge."

58687,"Spotify",2015-09-09,3,"It was GREEEAT ...before the update : It was perfect .... before the update.Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.After now: You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can not put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.The update was just today. 9/9/15 I feel so upset.*The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify is not very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.I am so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can not afford premium. it is not worth it. :"

I did not find the interface intuitive or easy to use: Like most things on the Internet, it is easy once you know how to do it. I found that it was playing random things not even closely related to what I was selecting. I am certainly not ready to sign up for the paid subscription yet."

58772,"Spotify",2017-06-12,2,"I miss Napster. Terrible user interface. I try to play a song on my phone, but it plays on my Alexa upstairs apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on. Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song, and then play that. I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times, but, boy, do I miss Napster."
58773,"Spotify",2017-04-06,5,"An able app Ease of use great library"
58777,"Spotify",2016-01-26,4,"Great depending on genre, not for me Spotify if you are familiar with and number 34;Americas top 40 hits and number 34; u can keep up easily with pop songs, it is perfect for that. Also great for relaxed order of songs and if you are ok with limits to skips.I myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40.In summary, Compared to apps like rdio and Pandora it is a big one up for pop songs, but if you are after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go."
58782,"Spotify",2017-04-01,3,"Amazing app but please fix Its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped! Please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug"
58787,"Spotify",2015-09-14,3,"Decent, but not perfect. I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
58788,"Spotify",2016-08-05,5,"Perfect song app You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it is all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it is more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
58789,"Spotify",2016-07-22,5,"Great for Phone without an FM Tuner! Spotify is easy to use and works great when you do not have an FM tuner chip in your phone. I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 and of course I would own the one without the FM tuner chip so radio apps will not work I like this because I can play an artist, genre or a decade!"

58800,"Spotify",2016-07-18,2,"Could not upload audio CD data We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device. Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD from our physical home library. It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so. In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running. In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service."
58802,"Spotify",2016-04-03,5,"soifily Bc it is the best in the world you can play music off line it is awesome"
58806,"Spotify",2017-04-01,5,"Very awsome Love this app the best thing I ever found that is free ☺"
58812,"Spotify",2015-02-22,2,"Not allowing me to pay for premium I would appreciate Spotify Music more if it allowed me to use by Visa Debit card to pay for premium monthly. Can you imagine that I am willing to make a monthly payment for this service and just because I am in the Caribbean I am restricted, and then it seems that when they noticed that I am not from any of the approved regions, I assume they figured that out after i entered my card info, i got locked out of my account all together, stupse. So I am annoyed. When they get their act together i most likely would give a higher rating....Smh, to think people bout the place pirating and I am willing to pay and here strugglin, stupse."
58814,"Spotify",2014-06-18,5,"woohoo! I started using spotify on the computer and now I have it of all of my devices. I would reccomend it to anyone that loves music."
58817,"Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!! This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
58818,"Spotify",2017-05-20,5,"Music Store in your hand! It has a great selection of music. When paired with Pandora, this app is a great way to discover new artists or music. Some may complain about having to pay for more freedom in playing music. While this is a downside, one can always purchase the soundtrack from Amazon, Google or in a physical store. Or dig deep and apply for premium. 😏"
58823,"Spotify",2015-10-19,3,"Uh... This app was great, we all know it.But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I am not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"
58831,"Spotify",2016-11-22,5,"Well Worth the Price I love using Spotify. I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith. I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly. Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips."

58836,"Spotify",2015-09-15,2,"used to like it And one point the app recognised my 7 and number 34; kindle as a tablet which I mean is not it??? And I could choose a song,I still had adds bit I did not have to just shuffle. Then one day the app updated and my kindle was recognised as a mobile device and I can only shuffle. So I just got tired of only getting recommended songs.I just use YouTube or Soundcloud even Pandora."

58851,"Spotify",2015-01-20,2,"Worked great, Now almost unusable At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can not get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It does not seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps I.e. Pandora seem to be working just fine. I am about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"
58854,"Spotify",2017-04-01,5,"Solid Works as advertised"
58859,"Spotify",2017-01-18,5,"I love it! I love streaming music. Every album I have wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I will have more time for music and cancel it easily when I do not. I try all kinds of music because there is no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.there is no need to store things. it is great for people who do not have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. it is not just for millennials."
58860,"Spotify",2016-12-26,3,"Really???!!! I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can not get this. I still have it but I am really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I will get rid of it and I really do not want to because I like it but if you do not fix it is gonna go :/"
58862,"Spotify",2016-01-04,2,"really? You guys are idiots, why allow this app to be used without premium if youre going to make sure it doesnt work after so long without premium, the heck, I have a 3 playlists and what they cant work without premium? This is frickin stupid."
58863,"Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Spotify is cool Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I have experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."
58864,"Spotify",2014-10-14,4,"that is my jam winking This app is so fun.But there is one tiny catch if you are trying to fknd asong and you do not know what the title is its very hard to find.But other than that this app is off the hook.You can listen to certain songs.But you have to have an account. And that is free to and its so easy to make the a account. This app is so fun. My favorite songs is Birdwalk by soulja boy.Well that is all I am telling you you can find out the rest when you get this app.You need to get this app. You will be doing me a huge favor."

This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. it is beautiful, chic and it has great sound quality.ignore old review of this, it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads, but they are not very common. Also it is has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you will ever make."

When I would like to listen to one song in my own playlist, and she wants to listen to a song in hers, my tablet will play the same song she is playing on her separate iphone se, and vice versa, I can not listen to anything without it playing on her phone, I do not like it. I have tried to turn it off but nothing seems to work, please fix this."
58891,"Spotify",2014-06-17,5,"Awesome it is amazing to listen to any song from any artist.

58910,"Spotify",2017-03-17,5,"BEST app for music I can not even express how much I love this app. I have tried iheartradio, the Windows music thing, iTunes, and this, and Spotify is the best out of all of them. I had been using the Windows music thingy I forget what it is called lol but I needed an app for my kindle that does the same thing-- Spotify is that app, only its better than what I was using. You do not have to download the music-- it is all there in Spotify's massive library of songs, albums, artists, and more. You can create playlists, listen to songs, save music, and much more. Only on some occasions do you ever search for a song and see its not there-- about 98 percent of songs you search for are there. I found out about Spotify because my friend recommended it to me and at first I was a little skeptical because you have to sign up for it, but everything even the deluxe albums are still FREE. My dad asked me if it was legal because everything is free and yes, Spotify is 100 percent legit and legal-- they get there money from 30 second ads about every 15 songs or so. The only small error I ever encountered was sometimes it takes a minute to load, but that is probably just my old kindle. This app is also compatible with every single device I have ever used. Overall, I love this app and I hope you get it because it took me a long time to type this"
58911,"Spotify",2016-03-23,3,"alright but....... I deleted it by mistake and downloaded it again but I could not sign back i n because I had forgotten my password. It did not give me an option to change my password . I could not make a new a count because it said my email was already taken. I would not rament this app for two reasons surprised ne if youndelete it you never get it backTwo they do not have popular artists thet kids now a days loveDO NOT GET THIS APP"
58914,"Spotify",2016-11-21,5,"Spotlight: I find the variety of music offered by Spodify to be phenomenal. Such a wide variety of music. The cost for a prime subscription is so reasonable. I thoroughly enjoy searching for music I love and listening to it through this app. FIW of ATL"
58916,"Spotify",2016-04-02,5,"m Most helpful app"
58918,"Spotify",2016-02-03,2,"Not only is the premium service only worth the money ... Not only is the premium service only worth the money if I am using it on mobile but the free version is so irritating it basically forces you to upgrade. While it is perfectly reasonable for ads to play when using a free service I noted two things recently after years of using it: 1 an average of three adds ran in between each song - a rate that even Pandora never uses and 2 ads ran when I played my own local files."
58919,"Spotify",2017-08-19,5,"Great music Great music and I enjoy every minute"
58922,"Spotify",2015-09-11,4,"Pretty awesome app. I am officially a hooked on Spotify listener/ user. I love the variations in stations, weather it be in genres or moods, Spotify has it ALL! I particularly like the Discovery Weekly playlist which stays in tuned with what you like listening to, keeps you up to speed with fresh music and a lil hint of older hits.Definitely recommend Spotify to others to experience, listen and enjoy its splendor! 😉🙌😁🎶🎵📻🎧"
58924,"Spotify",2014-06-19,5,"Spotify is Spot On! Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better! The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch. Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me. Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!"

58954,"Spotify",2015-09-12,2,"New update sad I loved spotify until they got their new update. Now it'd similar to pandora and you can not choose what song , you can not listen to a specific song, and there is no longer a queue so you can not know what song your going to listen to. I hate the new update, now you only can use those things if you purchase the premium sad spotlight is a good app but now it is just not as good."

Worst app imaginable if you are on free subscription and a music lover who loves to listen to specific songs and artists. Someone like me. Even the most basic thing like choosing your own music is not permitted, even on a limited basis. Not recommended if you are not ready to spend dollar 10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there is no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. 😔"

You can not skip songs, you have to listen to what they pick. Now it is like Pandora.

59551,"Spotify",2015-10-08,2,"what happened? I have had spotify on my kindle for the almost three years, and its been great to me the whole time: I could find just about any song I wanted, queue up my own playlist in the order I want, and listen to individual songs at my leisure. It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I do not think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you do not, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend dollar 24 a month just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone! I will definitely be looking for other apps now that offer the same wide library but free access to order the songs as you wish.This app WAS great, but overnight I am assuming some corporate bum took over and decided to rob half the world of music. Good on you, bub. :'"
59553,"Spotify",2017-03-02,5,"Exceptional! This is te best music app!"
59554,"Spotify",2017-05-16,5,"Read this This is better than Pandora because you can choose which song you would like to hear. I highly recommend this app."

59572,"Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Absolutely awesome. Just two flaws.. Your search for a great app for music has ended! Spotify has thousands of songs to choose from. Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you will not have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded devices, you do not have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it is no issue for me at all. Besides that, this app is great for all the people who need to listen to music ln a daily basis. On VERY rare occasion does it crash btw."

Here's where the crap comes in..I noticed I could not click on the song I wanted so I thought id just skip through shuffle to find it.

No mixing if you do not want to mix.I love being able to listen to a specific entire albums of an artist and that is something you can not do on Pandora... And do not get me wrong, I love Pandora."

It does not really change when you lower the volume on the device you have.The app cuts out shortly after I enter my browser or go to text.

60046,"Spotify",2016-11-14,5,"Spotify is the go-to music app Spotify is the best go-to music app available. I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed. I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop. I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data. There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists, which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder. It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you will understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"

This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe. I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle. A seemingly endless supply of music. I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for. I am not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there is not."

60077,"Spotify",2016-02-08,4,"Almost got it. So close. Mostly perfect. Very manual transmission in design. For some, this is a great thing. You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save. I am ambiguous on what follow -ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants, all this freedom can seem horrifying, It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own. This could be frustrating if it is not considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track that the service is aware of to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things while the well behaved android thing runs can be confusing/annoying. This is not a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The Oh, ya. There might be desktop users. thing seems to be an afterthought. This is not a criticism of the app itself. It can only do what it is programmed to do, But, desktop user manipulating user's library seems to unfortunately be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there is few things lacking as I can tell. In particular as of this date. Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use Winter Light a newer album/rehash, or whatever. I can live with that."

60080,"Spotify",2014-06-22,5,"Nice Service I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself. I notice the app plays short ads, where for some reason I do not if I use the web page on my PC, maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads."

60098,"Spotify",2014-08-04,2,"Its like free. I tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you. Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice which probably costs money you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost.When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, we know you have to pay for cable, but we do not tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads.Pandora is the same.....do not want to pay, we interrupt your play. it is all about the money and getting more."

60102,"Spotify",2015-02-18,5,"Worth it, free or premium Spotify has an amazing selection, no doubt. The ability to create your own playlists, surf from one related artist or group to another in other words, discover new music economically by listening to the entire track, and to listen offline Premium only it is a coded special file, so do not think you get to keep it permanently is truly great for the listener. However, the artists are severely underpaid. Services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally. If you want to do them justice, be more than a complacent consumer and tell Spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from. Hold Premium hostage! Only get the free version until they change their ways!"
60111,"Spotify",2017-05-11,4,"Pretty Awesome The music is great, they have near everything. Wish you did not have to pay to play the immediate song you wanted to instead of putting it on shuffle. Otherwise, great app that you should totally get!!"

I use Spotifyt all the time, and I have a favorite playlist on Spotify that I listen to each morning when I read the paper. Spotify does not have some of the bells and whistles of iTunes or Amazon Music; but the search feature is easy to use, and it is very easy to create and modify playlists. I especially like the fact that it plays through my Amazon Echo."
60115,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass. I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I am not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I am trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."

60119,"Spotify",2016-07-26,4,"Great but I am giving it four stars.... Spotify is great! It is almost like Pandora only you can search and pick individual songs and make your own playlists. They do not have everything but they do have a lot. Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording but I do not know if Spotify controls that or not."

I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
60127,"Spotify",2014-06-21,4,"Pretty good overall I like that there is a huge amount of music available, that seems to make Spotify more likely to have the specific types I am interested in. I also like being able to search and find entire CDs of music and put them into an easily accessible list. Kind of like having CDs on my computer. I do wish that there was info on each CD or artist, or the lyrics, the way that Pandora does."

60150,"Spotify",2016-05-23,4,"A great way to find new and old music and add to my library I finally got this app to work on my new phone!! Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone. I have been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can not immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it. So a lot of deleting is going on. I am also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I am looking for. Very inconsistent. But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it is a great way to find new and old music and add to my library."

You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! there is a tiny but. haha On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you do not know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it is not when there is one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it is helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite 😊"

The premium version is the best dollar 10 a month I can possibly spend. I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew...

It aswell has similar channels in some parts to what you would find on Pandora, so trust me when I say you will not be missing much of anything!"
60191,"Spotify",2017-08-11,1,"Secret Overcharges - Horrible Customer Service First of all, I have been a loyal premium user student subscription for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions, as well the other features provided - offline streaming, Discover station etc.However, beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First, I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription dollar 9.99 for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year, and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged dollar 30 more, without the possibility of a refund - DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.Second, good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad, your credit card MUST match the country you are in - which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance-payments i.e. 3 months or more so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow 24 hours to receive an automated email response and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly."

I used to have problems trying to find all kinds of free music downloader apps and apps like pandora... but Spotify really has it all! It is your one stop shop for endless playback, new music, radio options, while being able to follow artists and your friends. I highly recommend this app if you are an avid music listener, you like finding random music, or for just about anyone else out there. It has something for all!!!"
60203,"Spotify",2014-12-18,5,"More music at your fingertips If you like the ~1 million track library Prime Music now has you should try out Spotify and its ~30 million tracks of music. it is like trying to drink from a fire hose, but eventually you will learn how to explore and you will never have to listen to just a small library of purchased tracks again!The interface is well designed and easy to use. it is almost exactly like it is Android version so no real Fire tablet/phone extras, but still well done.

I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal. I think dollar 9.99 a month is a little over priced, since I could get Prime with all that comes with it for under dollar 100. But I will want to download eventually, so when I am not so broke, I will be investing in it."

60336,"Spotify",2015-08-18,5,"Five stars! I have always loved Spotify! it is free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there is advertisements here and there I do not mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist is not your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related.

I used to have Pandora and Spotify is so much better. it is nice to be able to select a specific song to play, Pandora does not allow you that option.

Pandora only allows you to skip so many songs at a time, then it makes you wait to skip a song after you have met your quota for songs you do not like."

I do not know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls and Boys or any song? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle!

I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I would be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate. Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?"
60363,"Spotify",2014-08-09,4,"i like it but... I am still in the the honeymoon phase , having fun picking out the wide variety of music I love. There is not anything that I haven't found and some I forgot about.I had not read any reviews prior to picking them out, my aim was to listen as I drive, I see I need premium. I do not want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I will enjoy it as is."

The Spotify premium subscription is well worth dollar 10.67 a month, can not live without Spotify, I use it everyday at work and when working out. So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized. Spotify is the new ITunes, in my opinion.**"

60372,"Spotify",2014-12-28,4,"Great except.... I was a faithful Pandora listener both at home and work then I discovered Spotify. what is not to love? ad free, music available offline and they have every artist I look for. So why only four stars? Spotify has to do what Pandora manages seamlessly-allow me to block explicit content. I cannot stream radio at work for fear of the f-bomb emitting from my speakers. Fix that and you will have hit the sweet spot!"
60381,"Spotify",2016-08-28,5,"Works perfectly in my Kindle Fire HD 7 I thought this app was not going to be as complete as it is for the other platforms but I guess it is taken from the official Android one and it is complete!Everything I expect it to have it does. can not really complain about anything, does not crash, not laggy Kindle Fire HD 7 .Thank you Spotify!"
60389,"Spotify",2017-03-15,4,"I love this app and it is pretty cheap for the monthly ... I love this app and it is pretty cheap for the monthly premium subscription. There are times when a song or two are not available but I am sure it has to do with licensing issues that come with artists and streaming services. Otherwise I think it is worth the dollar 10"
60394,"Spotify",2016-12-25,1,"Spotify App I have downloaded this app 5 times. When it opens, all it says is Internal Error that I may not have a strong enough signal, but that does not appear th o be the problem. Heard this is a great app and want to use it, but right now, I am not impressed."

You can choose from lots of genres and sub genres and seemingly concocted styles to form your own playlists. And for 10 bucks a month you can have playlists available offline too. And if I am not mistaken you can publish your playlists, and share playlists between friends double check on that feature though. So yeah, Spotify's the bestest."

60407,"Spotify",2017-08-07,1,"Do You Enjoy Malware? it is never good when your laptop for business is down all day because of malware. I am having to bust my laptop back to 0 because there is not a malware or antivirus program that can fix the problems of Spotify software. I can not tell you if using spotify is a good or bad thing. I could not get past all the garbage that their software downloaded to my computer. And I used the software from their personal website. Then, they wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade and pay for it. This has cost me enough."

60410,"Spotify",2015-12-22,5,"awesome Spotify has all the songs witch is awesome. It has every genre of music that you can think of and has the greatest songs. Also spot if uhh is cheap and has great deals. The moment that I got spotlight I got rid of all my of music apps. it is awesome how when I am on the road I can have downloaded music that I can listen to unlike Pandora. Spotify has songs on there that haven't even come out yet. You can listen to it on different devises when ever you want."
60411,"Spotify",2017-01-28,5,"Great app for a great platform. I am a Spotify Premium user. I have been using Spotify for nearly two years now and I love it.

60417,"Spotify",2017-08-28,5,"Easy to use This is a great item. Easy to use with great selection of music"
60419,"Spotify",2015-02-23,4,"good music app For some reason the interface bugs me but other than that it works well, reminiscent of grooveshark but with not much of a limit I think. Some songs are hard to find and I wish that they had an option to filter out clean versions of songs so I did not have to add a song and go back and find the dirty version like some kind of Neanderthal after I realize this travesty."
60423,"Spotify",2017-05-01,4,"Great music app The app is good but I do not like how they do not have certain songs. But it is still a fun app to use."

I 'm a very poor - financially - ,Senior who missed the music I have had around me all my 70 yrs...This app brings it back to my welcoming Ears ..!!! even though there are commercials.. I am grateful none-the-less..!"

Spotify is a very weak little brother in comparison...playlists are weak and have too many b sides. And the French commercials are irritating. Bring back my Amazon Music App! Please!!"
60439,"Spotify",2016-02-02,4,"pretty good I love this app I use it everyday my only problem with it is that at first you can only shuffle you can not choose the song and it has to be online or you can not listen to it offline without buying Premium. I do not know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app"
60441,"Spotify",2015-11-02,4,"almost all I want I used to listen to Pandora quite a bit, which my son introduced me to. Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me and number 34;oh, I do not even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better. and number 34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application I haven't upgraded yet is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."
60442,"Spotify",2017-09-03,1,"Bad Given up on trying to get this app to work...Pandora rules!"
60444,"Spotify",2017-05-28,1,"No option to play just radio , no explicit content, versions of songs. Not good for kids or tweens. Spotify still does not see the need to provide any ability to control content, i.e. no option in settings to choose the radio version of songs and block explicit content versions. Not only is this an issue for users under 18, but it is an issue if folks over 18 are want a music app to provide music at a party with kids. They have a family plan but the app is not family friendly at all. Also, all the lyrics are available for any user, no care about age. As a parent I will not load this on my kids devices, as an adult I will not use it on my devices."
60452,"Spotify",2017-04-24,5,"Amazing! My dad got me premium, and I have been using it for over a year! Works great, took a while to get used to when I first switched from amazon prime, but other then that, it really works!"

60456,"Spotify",2017-09-01,4,"Wonderful!! Spotify is a wonderful free music app that I enjoy very much. I can create my own playlists and also listen to others. Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. that is not a ridiculous asking price I am just too cheap. I thoroughly enjoy this app!"
60459,"Spotify",2017-06-24,5,"Love it... can not wait to upgrade! Nothing to smile about. The 9.99 price...per month. Not worth it. Would be better off sticking to the non premium version, putting up with the ads and not bothering to download anything. Just kidding. Wish I could afford it. Maybe one day. Why does the logo look like a... Nevermind."
60463,"Spotify",2017-06-21,5,"why did I wait so long? Why did I wait so long to try Spotify? The current 99 cents for 3 months deal pushed me over the edge. I may not be able to look back. The app works great on my Android phone and Kindle. But where it really shines is on my Echo."
60464,"Spotify",2017-07-18,5,"love it This is the greatest thing ever.i do not buy music any more. I use it at work home and in my car. I use premium, no commercial,plays what ever I feel like and when my selection is over it continues playing based on what I was listening to."

Spotify is wonderful, I pay the dollar 10 subscription and now my cell phone is my music collection. plugs into my car and home stereo via bluetooth. You can follow a muse and pick an artist you have liked in the past and see the body of their work. I re-discovered Electric Light Orchestra ELO lots of fun to listen. And now to Classical music is unlimited, hearing Composers I never heard before. Great."

The only problem I have with the app is there is no back key to get out of a dialogue link I do not want or accidentally got. Also, it would be a great help if the app had a directions for this page pull-down menu. Otherwise, once I learn the ins and outs, I think it will be a great addition."
60530,"Spotify",2016-10-20,5,"Awesome! I love this app! I only have one complaint, sometimes when I watch the ad for 30 min of ad free music it does not give me the 30 min but I still had to watch the ad. Other than that this is a awesome app."
60532,"Spotify",2017-03-18,3,"Its amazing, but there is one problem I have used this app for the longest time and it never failed to make me smile. But, in the newest update it does not quite let me add a song to a playlist or either save, or share it. Please fix it, Thank you!"

The app does not drain the battery, user friendly happy , and have very little if any commercials. I have tried quite a few music apps but after finding this gem I deleted all of the others. I play one song of my favorite artist/group and Spotify continues on with the songs from the same group/singer.Thanks Spotify!!"

By purchasing premium you can also download the music from your playlists to listen to at anytime. The free version does occasionally play ads, however two 30 second ads every 30 minutes or so is worth it considering the amount of selection and customization available for free."

I got to choose what song I listened to, and I did not have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can not choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I could not care less about, and now I can not even skip it because I have reached my limit, skipping the songs I do not want to listen to.I got an app that was not like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it is changed into the equivalent of that.To sum it all up,I can not choose my own musicI could not care less about the suggested musicI hate the song-skip limitI just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I am unable to skip over to the song I want.I am just disappointed, tbh."

61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I thought it would be... When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it was not the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they would uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I am just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it is certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can not do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It does not have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I am listening to The Color Spectrum and it decides to throw a song from Migrant in the mix, that is really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you No, I do not like every album that band has put out. or just lump everything into a few too-big categories hip-hop, indie, rock, country and throw the most random s*** from said category at you And no, new Train is nothing like Of Great and Mortal Men ..You only get a small number of skips if you do not have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it is not. Because that other app you are thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from Migrant at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I will stick with Pandora."

With this app, I have my music with me while I read; just add a cup of coffee and I can say I am in heaven.The app runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire6, no issues whatsoever. It synchronizes perfectly and sound quality is great taking into account the Kindle speaker's limitations. If you have used Spotify on your PC/Mac, or Android devices; you will see no difference in here."

When enabling music to play offline it causes all downloaded music to be stored in your internal storage bank which fills up extremely quickly. The lack of option to move the storage to an SD cards means very minimal download space. I love Spotify but this is just a terrible side of this app. Hopefully they fix it soon."

61653,"Spotify",2015-02-18,3,"A little better than Pandora Plus, but twice the price. It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over unlike pandora but dollar 10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."
61662,"Spotify",2014-09-12,5,"My favorite music streaming app! I love making playlist on my PC and listening to them on my iPhone. I have lists for running, camping, driving, chilling, pretty much anything. Sure there are ads in the free version, but you have to decide for yourself if it is worth ponying up money to skip commercials and listen to music on demand. It is still way fewer breaks than FM radio and I do not mind my playlists shuffled."

It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I am not paying money to use an app. Sorry am not happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff is not fee. it is a good app but it is not the best especially for those folks who do not have spare money to waste."

I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month. That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time. I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."

Sometimes when I play a song, it will not have any sound, which gets rather irritating after a while. I also have found that spotify on apple devices iPad, iPhone is extremely better to navigate and easier to use. If kindle can make the layout more like that, I would change the rating to 5 stars."

61806,"Spotify",2014-10-16,4,"Balancing Positives and Negatives I think this app is brilliant , it has a Apple look to it and I use it all the time. That being said I only scored it 4/5 and this is because you have to have a internet connection to use it luckily I have a kindle and I do not take it out much, but I would not be able to use it on a phone for this reason."

I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go and number 34;premium and number 34; or relegate us to and number 34;shuffle and number 34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE.
