1,"Amazon",2016-03-28,5,"I like it better than Pandora. love this music app. great selection. Better than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone. Not happy however that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App Amazon if someone could contact me about this would greatly appreciated The Amazon Cloud app does not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app.....Thanks!"
3,"Amazon",2017-10-03,5,"Amazon Music is great I do not know why I did not get it ... Amazon Music is great I do not know why I did not get it sooner. love it."
7,"Amazon",2015-06-17,5,"Amazon does it again! This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"
22,"Amazon",2017-07-21,5,"Love this! I can listen anywhere to the music I have already selected. Love this!!!"
24,"Amazon",2016-12-20,1,"Avoid this at all costs. I gave it one star because I could not give it zero. Nothing works on this system. The help desk is not useful either although they tried and the software is anything but user friendly. I would pass this up along with ECHO which is the worst purchase I ever made. Do not take it even if offered for free."
25,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Amazon music for Android I plan to work with it a little more but so far am not impressed. Too complex. Too many steps involved to listen to music in spite of the emails telling me was a great offering is available to me as a Prime member. Pandora is much simpler and user friendly."
29,"Amazon",2017-10-14,5,"Five Stars Very nice"
36,"Amazon",2016-11-01,5,"Five Stars easy to use great selection!"

45,"Amazon",2017-07-20,5,"Five Stars love amazon music"
49,"Amazon",2017-04-28,5,"Five Stars Love site"
51,"Amazon",2017-04-06,4,"Good all around source for music. Pretty good availability. Not all choices available free musicare the original musicians or versions of particular songs you probably can purchase them . On my laptop the Playlist is a little hard to edit ."
52,"Amazon",2017-06-20,5,"Five Stars good app"
53,"Amazon",2016-03-23,1,"BB no longer supported I always gave great credit to Amazon for doing its part to make Android apps available for the BlackBerry OS. No longer. I have reason to own a BB10 OS device which does have the ability to run Android apps but only if the vendor allows the app to be downloaded which in this case Amazon no longer allows. I am dumping my Amazon Prime subscription and giving the money to Spotify."
54,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Five Stars perfect"
67,"Amazon",2017-03-15,5,"Five Stars AWESOME"
74,"Amazon",2017-06-04,3,"Three Stars ok app"
76,"Amazon",2016-03-10,5,"Being old... I saw the birth of ... Being old...I saw the birth of the 8 Track player the cassette then the CD DVD and now the cloud . What will they think of next? Think I forgot about the MP3...not sure where it fits. Personally I do not have one least not that I am aware of. I should probably rent a little kid between say 8 and 10. They know more about this stuff than 20 adults OVER 65!"
77,"Amazon",2017-08-11,5,"Five Stars Works great."
78,"Amazon",2016-01-20,3,"it is good On a small device it is hard to navigate. It also does not remember what you did the last time you were on so you have to repeat everything. Sometimes slow to load and buffering issues but that may also be the fault of my provider. Overall it is good."
81,"Amazon",2017-05-03,5,"Five Stars love"
84,"Amazon",2014-06-23,2,"Prime Music Needs Work Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection is small and includes mostly older music. While it generally works OK for the music it does have I was unable to find any way to just search the music that is available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I went to listen to a song it was going to charge me.If you were able to limit the search and list of songs to only those available for free I would have given it a higher score but at the moment it was a lot more frustration than listening pleasure."
86,"Amazon",2017-04-16,5,"Five Stars Good"
87,"Amazon",2017-06-01,5,"Five Stars Love"
89,"Amazon",2017-08-30,4,"great service all kinds of music great service all kinds of music. would be great if it had a voice recognition to search for music while you drive"
94,"Amazon",2016-06-11,2,"Crashes my Android often and chews data like crazy. Very counter intuitive to install on a second ... Crashes my Android often and chews data like crazy. Very counter intuitive to install on a second device the amount of hunting I am having to do to conduct a simple operation like install on a PC is insane."
96,"Amazon",2017-10-10,5,"Five Stars Love Amazon music"
100,"Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually Works Well This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it does not well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
102,"Amazon",2017-07-18,4,"Four Stars Ok"
105,"Amazon",2014-06-15,3,"Lacking content but free Get free music from a service that you already pay for. How can you not like it!! The selection is a little scarce but it is new so I am sure the selection will increase in time. Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors instead of launching additional services. Just seems a little backwards to me but I will not complain about something free!!"
107,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Not happy with Android app I do not know what the core problem is but I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 AT and T and I have another app that can track things like when apps restart multiple times consuming resources like RAM memory response time and temperature and for whatever reason this and all the other Amazon apps have periods where they will restart anywhere from 5 to 47 times in a 5 minute period. Amazon you gotta fix this it is not right to be slowing down a competitor's product."
109,"Amazon",2017-03-03,5,"It is great! I adore this app. It is great !"
111,"Amazon",2017-08-31,5,"Five Stars Love this app! Tons of music. Easy to navigate around. 5 stars!"
118,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"It should be free to download Some songs to download you have to buy so again whats the point of been a prime member ? Amazon is trying to squeeze every cents out of us."
120,"Amazon",2017-04-29,5,"Five Stars One of the best music channels out there!!! Thank you Amazon!!"
121,"Amazon",2017-05-15,5,"Five Stars fantastic"
122,"Amazon",2015-04-23,4,"I like it wish it had more Hawaiian Jawaiian flare I love Amazon Prime and now they have added Prime Music I like it for the most part there are a lot of popular songs and some new songs that I get to listen for Free. I took one star away because like I said before it is only POPULAR music. I live in Hawaii and I love it when streaming sites let me listen to my own local music. Granted they have like old Hawaiian Slack Key music but I am more interested in local Jawaiian music that plays locally over the radio."
125,"Amazon",2015-12-05,5,"A great app to use on my android phone and tablet A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I am on other devices then my computer."
126,"Amazon",2017-11-06,2,"The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which ... The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. it is o dollar 2 less than Google Music which is not much of a difference so decided to keep Google Music. Mainly I do not want to have to go through and reset playlists also."
127,"Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"Music to my ears! I love this app. I am still learning and navigating my way through but it is the only music app I use now! It has a lot to offer!"
132,"Amazon",2015-09-05,5,"Blown away! Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it is been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I am stoked on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!"
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix Great its part of Prime"
137,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Worst update ever!!! This was a forced update that if you uninstall it it removes your amazon app completely. I lost all of my playlists and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menus and too may ads. And I do not know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
138,"Amazon",2017-10-23,5,"Five Stars Great!"
150,"Amazon",2017-01-01,4,"can not remove only the duplicate songs. Very cool but there is no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."
153,"Amazon",2017-11-12,5,"Five Stars I love this app. It even works with Alexia."
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars Love it"
157,"Amazon",2016-04-13,1,"The Worst Amazon Product Ever If I could give this app negative stars I would.I have been a longtime Amazon customer since the '90's. When the Amazon MP3 app came out it was great. There were free daily MP3's and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish but then you would get a new Android phone and it would be okay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps Shopping and Kindle. It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again and it worked for maybe a month before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non existent they will only talk to you on the phone and then they will tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING which is ridiculous.I recently tried the app again and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re login but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me it gives me a network error so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version and guess what it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can not access my cloud library or Prime Music.So I give up Amazon. I have bought a ton of crap from you and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great Music works great on my iPad and Kindle Fire and Fire TV so I do not know what your problem is."
159,"Amazon",2016-11-27,4,"I dislike the updated user interface I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user."
165,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon music with prime music I have tried downloading it my 3 units Desk top is OK but does not let me access all my playlistsMy Android only seem to have some of the Albums but mostly singles from the albums listedMy note pad I installed it then I had a problem so I deleted it now it tells me I already have it loaded but I cannot find the icon to reinstall itAll you seem to want is for me to purchase more music though prime when I can not play the music I already have loaded"
167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right it is an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle echo music prime etc. they can not seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
172,"Amazon",2017-03-14,4,"Four Stars great work"
177,"Amazon",2016-08-23,5,"it is much better than listening to the radio I use this all the time. I have the app on my phone so I can take it with me every where I go. I have found sooo much music from back in the day that I thought I would never hear again. it is much better than listening to the radio...no commercials! It made all my other music apps obsolete...just plain love it!"
179,"Amazon",2016-08-21,5,"Love this perk with prime! I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.I love all the chanel's offered."
180,"Amazon",2014-07-29,3,"No artist data When I use with Bluetooth in car the displayed data is missing artist. I can see track and album but artist data missing. This only happens with Amazon music. Google songza milk Pandora Spotify all display complete data"
182,"Amazon",2015-11-04,3,"The Amazon Cloud Player app on Samsung Smart TV is not good. I am pleased with Amazon Prime Music on my desktop and Android devices but I am not pleased with the Amazon Cloud Player on my Samsung Smart TV. The Cloud Player has limited functionality and will not play Amazon Prime music it will only play my music.Unfortunately 90 percent of my use of Amazon Prime Music would be via my Samsung Smart TV. Therefore I am back to Pandora and other apps on the TV."
184,"Amazon",2017-09-22,1,"Waste of time. Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expected way more from Amazon."
186,"Amazon",2015-09-26,1,"IT KEEPS CRASHING... AND CRASHING... AND OOPS... CRASHED LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD INTO A FARMERS MARKET! I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crashes every few minutes. I have used it in the past with no issues but with this HTC one M8 it crashes and then wants me to send a report. Every time this happens it shuts does whatever other program i am using. GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!YES I have tried updating does not helpYES I have tried to install/re install its factory so there is no total uninstall"
188,"Amazon",2016-04-06,4,"Nice perk for prime members For prime members this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices. I was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime. I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists. Also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card."
197,"Amazon",2016-07-04,5,"Five Stars I was so happy to be able to have an offline mode to listen to the music."
198,"Amazon",2016-03-03,5,"LOVE Amazon Prime Music! I LOVE Amazon Prime Music! It is a great benefit to have included in my Amazon Prime membership. That is one of the main reasons I got my membership. I like being able to listen to the music I have picked on my phone via bluetooth in my car. I can switch it to the Offline Library so it does not charge me data to listen to my music. I would not be without it!"
201,"Amazon",2017-10-16,5,"Five Stars I love being able to create my own playlists."
211,"Amazon",2016-11-09,5,"Five Stars Love this app. It has so many features."
219,"Amazon",2014-11-10,2,"Very disappointed considering looking elsewhere for a cloud service/music player Regularly crashes and gives errors I have talked to tech support numerous times each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy. Sometimes I will play a song from my device not even on the cloud and it will take 10 minutes to load. Other times I will open it and it will immediately crash about 50 times until I can finally start to use it. I have had this for about a year and had to uninstall/reinstall it probably 30 times because of issues."
220,"Amazon",2016-04-05,1,"Not worth the money You have to pay for almost all the music pointless just get Spotify cheaper and has more music"
221,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Easy To Use Love it! No problems with the app and always easy to find my tunes."
228,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Good music selection and easy download Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes."
229,"Amazon",2015-05-27,1,"Losses track of library I use this to run with. Only problem is everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out sign back in and redownload the songs in my playlist. Then as soon as I disconnect from WiFi it loses my songs again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very updating bug."
238,"Amazon",2016-01-25,5,"Super Job with Amazon Prime Music! I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music! I have just started using this service but from what I can tell it is absolutely top notch! An endless selection of artists stations as well. Great job Amazon!"
239,"Amazon",2016-10-02,4,"I like it. Wish there were more choices I like it. Wish there were more choices. The selection is limited"
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App needs some improvement. I use this app all the time. Unfortunately it can not be used safely while driving.On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel.A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
256,"Amazon",2016-01-09,3,"good but could be better. The search function could be more user friendly and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre so if you want to hear only a specific type of music you ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to people who do not have as much music on it."
260,"Amazon",2017-07-23,4,"Four Stars like it"
261,"Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"A Grandmother with an MP3 App? I listen to music as I take my daily walk. I chose this product because the FM radio app was non functional and at times Pandora is unreliable. The Amazon MP3 app is amazing. it is always there! I like that I can create customized playlists never had one before. The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick. I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me. I am not too savvy with apps anyway but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon for making this free app available to your customers."
262,"Amazon",2017-07-31,2,"2 stars I am an international subscriber. I could not make use of my prime music nor videos. I could not even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad."
264,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"Would be great if it worked... On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade I used this app extensively and liked it. It now either freezes crashes or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
265,"Amazon",2016-02-04,1,"What a waste of a great idea Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back again. They need to consolidate some things quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organizations. When you fix it please call me. Signed: wish I could have spent my dollar 105.00 dollars."
266,"Amazon",2015-11-04,1,"never did figure out how to get any of the ... never did figure out how to get any of the benefits of prime to work before my free trial ended. no clue how to play music or watch anything"
273,"Amazon",2016-06-06,5,"Great deal I already had Prime for free shipping now I have free music too No commercials good user interface. The content is not as broad as Spotify but I found lots of music I like. Also Jason Aldean is on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
274,"Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Love love love Amazon! I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
275,"Amazon",2015-12-02,4,"Great service A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days."
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do ... I have Rhapsody now so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is rhapsody is easier and I do not have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/foodway to expensive!/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
291,"Amazon",2016-03-01,1,"CANCELLED Could not make this App work on my device canceled the order."
296,"Amazon",2015-10-07,1,"USA issued Credit Card.... seriously? Music Collection under prime could be better nevertheless i am happy with it because i do not need my spotify subscription edit After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i do not have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."
303,"Amazon",2017-03-08,5,"Great for any music lover Love and use it"
304,"Amazon",2016-04-03,1,"One Star Really? How about flip a switch And let this run on my Shield Tablet."
308,"Amazon",2015-10-22,3,"Not impressed. it is not horrible but it does not have near the music selection that spotify does. It wants to charge you for so much."
310,"Amazon",2016-07-05,3,"Works good. Not overly user friendly. Lacks any serious interactive functions. Your downloaded music for offline listening has to be individually added to Playlist. There seems to be no way to modify the properties of the individual audio files to identify a song as a genre that you think it more closely resembles."
314,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars I think it is great! Better than Pandora."
315,"Amazon",2015-09-12,5,"prime is number 1 for me do not care about the nay sayers. Prime is great so oo many songs playlists and genres of music to choose from. I also use Pandora. I pnow prefer Prime over pandora because I can play my music offline. There are a lot of music apps out there. They all have things you will love or hate. Give them a try especially the ones with free trials. Simply pick the one that works best for you."
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime! This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music my play list and stations or other playlists. Also the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would have given it a 1 but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
329,"Amazon",2016-11-03,4,"I am so glad they brought back the lyrics I am so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were. Although I wish like with Google music when listening to a station you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better."
336,"Amazon",2016-05-30,5,"Five Stars Its great has tons of music and albums also of artists;"
338,"Amazon",2016-03-07,5,"Love Amazon Music!!! Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercials!!! My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership."
342,"Amazon",2015-04-17,3,"Pros and Cons I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it is not unlimited. For the annual fee I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora Milk etc. but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."
346,"Amazon",2013-02-03,5,"wont open on Samsung Galaxy II RESOLVED. I am Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. Downloaded smoothly icon on the screen opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud I get Exception number 151 and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open but to no avail. So I have written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"
350,"Amazon",2016-02-27,5,"Amazon is the best way to buy music period. I think it is the best way to buy music these days. You have a selection of what you are looking for then you get immediate delivery via download house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened if you want. Plus no driving store lines or tax if you are lucky enough to live someplace that does not make you pay it."
352,"Amazon",2016-06-09,1,"Too much selling Always pushing to sell us more stuff."
353,"Amazon",2015-09-09,2,"OFTEN HAS ERRORS LOADING STORE it is a bit of a crapshoot whether or not the Amazon Music Store loads. It is not an internet issue or a maximum data usage issue. My phone which is new and has no problems with other apps sometimes sits trying to load it for 20 minutes after which I cancel for data usage issues. It has a wide selection but if I can not load the store half the time how can I access the selection???"
356,"Amazon",2017-06-26,5,"The best music app out there! Greatest app! All your favorite songs no adds unlimited skips and replays. does not ask you if you are still listening. Just another awesome addition to your Amazon Prime account"
359,"Amazon",2016-08-09,5,"absolutely amazing I do not know how they do it absolutely amazing. Leave it to Amazon to come up with such a great service for Prime members. I admit I have an eclectic love of all types of music. I love all types and when I go to look for it sure enough it is there. Thank you Amazon for Amazon Music as it has become a favorite"
362,"Amazon",2017-07-20,4,"Cool Cool. Just started using it. Haven't figured it all out so far I like it"
365,"Amazon",2017-10-14,5,"Five Stars I love Amazon music period. On any device it is awesome."
369,"Amazon",2016-12-08,5,"Music galore.Get rocking. Excellent choice of music New and old. Definitely recommend it to people of all ages and all types of music.Only recently acquired Amazzon Prime but wish I had got it a long time ago. Can also download music on my phone or tablet to listen offline."
373,"Amazon",2015-08-01,5,"Love it! Love the service. Had many up to date music and a lot of classics."
383,"Amazon",2017-09-14,5,"Five Stars great!"
384,"Amazon",2017-05-02,3,"Indefferent so far but it keeps asking for a review.... I can not give it much more but trying to learn how to use it better. I am used to other music apps and this is very different. I will give it a month to see for sure"
389,"Amazon",2017-07-29,5,"Five Stars Great app!"
398,"Amazon",2015-09-29,4,"I love the mixed music selections they offer its almost like ... I love the mixed music selections they offer its almost like iTunes Match only better. They already know what albums I am going to like and suggest them so that I can add them to my play list. Best of all I do not have to pay any extra money it is already included with my Prime Membership. I do not even use iTunes or beats what ever they are calling themselves these days"
404,"Amazon",2016-03-08,5,"Love Prime Music it is one of the best features of Prime. The variety of music that comes as a part of the Prime Music subscription is fantastic. Not everything I want is free but I haven't found anything yet that cannot be purchased. I listen to it all day at work when I can and then crank it up at home on weekends. I love Prime Music."
405,"Amazon",2017-02-23,1,"I can never get my music to download to my ... I can never get my music to download to my phone or laptop for that matter. Its just a HUGE pain in the BUTT!!!!! I can not even figure out how to get my questions answered and who has time to try and figure it out... I wish Zune still existed....."
408,"Amazon",2015-08-14,2,"I LOVE Amazon Prime Music BUT... I was one of the early Prime subscribers and generally am more than pleased by Amazon their products and services and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....However that having been said while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music APM I am forced to uninstall it. It is a HUGE space consuming app! Let me elaborate: I have had this smart phone for just barely over a year. I do not download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l. APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly in one of the folders within APM I found numerous folders with names such as 500 and 47 and 200 etc. Within EACH of these numerous folders I found the EXACT same images of album covers many/most of which I never played viewed downloaded etc. most were from the and number 34;Recommended for you and number 34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon and the other suggestions etc. made by Amazon Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images and data there is apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary space destroying! data! Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images and data the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96GIGABYTES! let me make this perfectly clear here that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes NOT Megabytes!! WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS and PLAYS MUSIC and number 60;need and number 62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!? This is absolutely RIDICULOUS I HOPE someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed I was constantly receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work. That was correct I missed phone calls could not receive texts etc. and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed. This includes my Android system OS obviously and virus/malware protection updates ... and just to be clear this overwhelming space consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!! Completely unacceptable thus it gone uninstalled. When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones which are NOT huge space storage devices to begin with! I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"
409,"Amazon",2017-07-18,3,"Could be more intuitive. The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion. I have one album downloaded and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."

461,"Amazon",2014-08-09,4,"Yes on Prime Music I think adding the free streaming music to the Prime membership is great. It is not as easy to use for me as the old Napster was but I like it as a substitute for Rhapsody."
462,"Amazon",2016-10-06,5,"Absolutely awesome!!! And free!! Absolutely awesome and free! You can listen to all the physical cds that you have purchased on amazons cloud the albums are automatically saved in the cloud after they are purchased and available to stream or download with this free app!!! what is not to like???"
465,"Amazon",2016-02-10,5,"LOVE IT !!!!! No longer do I have to carry around CD's anymore and haven't done so in years. Recently I my music library was just not organized like I wanted it to be. I have several different categories rock classical country alternative comedy Halloween sounds for trick or treaters Christmas music for sitting around the house etc. and have all of it totally organized in its own category. If I am in the mood for country I will just scroll to country hit shuffle all and hit play and all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order. Whether it is on my smartphone or on my tablet it is well worth it !!!"
467,"Amazon",2015-07-08,1,"This app needs more functions to be a good music player I went from play music to this. This app needs more functions to be a good music player."

482,"Amazon",2015-12-31,5,"I love my Prime Music I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iheartradio with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played. There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues."
485,"Amazon",2014-11-15,5,"Amazon Prime music is awesome I order a lot of stuff from Amazon but the 2day shipping is now a benefit to the music. My wife says that I am stuck in the 70's when it comes to music but I do like 50's and 60's rock and roll too. I have put almost 700 songs in my music library and I am not done yet. Thanks to my iPhone and my tablet and my awesome Bluetooth speaker I can take my favorite music anywhere. Amazon Prime is worth the cost just for the music and the videos."
492,"Amazon",2015-07-03,3,"Nice to not hear ads but pre mixed playlists are not the best. Should recommend other songs similar to what you are listening to. Also most radio/playlists suck. Switched to Google Play because they have free playlists with ads but a great Gym mix. Step up your game Amazon! I pretty much give them 1/2 my paycheck every two weeks because I love Amazon stuff. This is not doing it for me though... but I am sure they will algorithm it out soon."

507,"Amazon",2014-07-26,5,"once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is I was very reluctant to purchase Amazon Prime to obtain free shipping on all purchases because I only occasionally purchase items on Amazon. However once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is an extremely good deal. And I think I will be even more satisfied with Amazon Prime membership when I get time to explore the free video library that is available as an Amazon Prime member."
513,"Amazon",2016-05-10,5,"I love Amazon music I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I do not use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with."
516,"Amazon",2016-06-15,5,"Not to bad.. Really like it. I just wish they had more music choices in Prime. I have had to buy a lot of the songs I like because they were not listed in Prime."
522,"Amazon",2016-06-29,2,"it stinks! I would rather it have gone to my play music app but I did not have a choice. It took forever to figure out what happened to my downloads. Then I listened which went fine but once I got out I could not find it again. There is no icon. Still haven't found it. I hate this program!"

This is a free product to download to help store my music and retreive it later for use on other computers or devices like my Android phone. I can even transfer my music from my cloud player to my device. I can not compare it to other similar products because this is my first product I use to download and store my music. I am a beginner but it is easy to use. I have lost music on my computer but i was able to log on to amazon site sign in and reteive music from past and future purchases.

Now I have to recopy all my music approx 22G to make CD's to play in my car. I or computer. It had no business changing the music I had put on these drives. I do not like the thought one bit of copying all my music back. They should put someway to convert MP3 back into CD's again. Now if you buy MP3 music that should stay the way it was purchased. Leave original music on the computer alone!!"

This is very annoying and distracting and prevents me from enjoying my favorite songs. I did not become a subscriber to be very annoyed. Pandora and Slacker does not sync why can not you do the same?I am giving you a month to fix this problem and if it stays the same consider my subscription cancelled!"

The user interface is a bit perplexing and takes some getting used to and that is why i did not give it 5 stars.

I was pleased with the selection and being able to download my purchases to my phone and syncing it with other play lists previously created. Now with it being the prime music I can no longer sync it. So now I have to use two different apps to listen to music...DISLIKE!!!Amazon please go back to letting us download to our devices so we can use only 1 playlist!"

578,"Amazon",2015-03-31,2,"Very poorly designed This app on a Samsung G4 is very poorly designed. I still can not figure out how to close the app after I start it. There is an option in the app to clear the cache and this stops the player. But...why is not there an option to close. Also as others have mentioned the songs are never actually downloaded. They stay in the cloud so you will use your data minutes every time you run it."
580,"Amazon",2017-09-04,5,"No your ears are not hallucinating. Absolutely love it. All genres are represented. I love oldies the 50s and mellow listening. I can listen to all that I wish."

586,"Amazon",2017-08-02,5,"Five Stars Easy to use"
588,"Amazon",2011-08-10,3,"Room for improvement but good nonetheless The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud service and the store has some of the music I listen to is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really do not have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan happy Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app force closes mad . Attempted to play the song through via cloud times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer you can run windows but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."
589,"Amazon",2016-04-25,4,"it is kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based ... it is kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based on artist or genre. I am taking off one star because the random with the same style of artist is not very good. Odd combination of artists and not keeping the same vibe sing after song... As an add on to prime it is excellent."

591,"Amazon",2016-10-19,3,"I like the service as a Prime member I wish there were a way it would help me build playlists from my own music collection but aside from that I like the service as a Prime member.

605,"Amazon",2016-02-27,4,"I like it a lot I love that it has lots of music. There are a few songs that I wanted and could not find. However I was able to upload them from the Itunes store. I like that you have so many free songs and if there are other songs you want you can buy them and download them to any device. Overall a great product."
606,"Amazon",2014-08-24,2,"I wonder why they think I need their ad on music that I purchased? Amazon keeps messing up. I get the Amazon music app to purchase music from Amazon now I get this prime muisic garbage that keeps popping up. Why did Ispend money on a product that just shows ads?Like the Amazon VOD service it works great on a Kindle that runs android but if you have an Android tablet you are out of luvk. Other VOD services do not require a special tavlet but Amazon does. Amazon is getting worse than Apple."
608,"Amazon",2016-03-22,5,"Would give this 10 if I could! FINALLY a music app that let us YOU decide what songs you listen to! Genious! I am cancelling my pandora subscription immediately.

I really like that I can download so many of my favorites for free. Pretty awesome! I feel like I get my moneys worth with my Prime membership with so many benefits available. One of my smarter investments."
630,"Amazon",2014-06-20,3,"Is it really free? I was nieve I guess to think the music could be mine on my computer not understanding that it is all in the cloud . The whole concept is still settling in on my brain. I do like the sample songs but you have to keep pressing the new song when one is over they do not just play one after the other. do not chuckle at me I am new to this stuff.....Amazon continues to be a world of wonder and fun and the music is just another facet of this diamond"
632,"Amazon",2015-06-21,2,"I have shopped with amazon for years but this prime thing and the music app both suck. And stop trying to trick or entice me ... Amazon music with prime? I have turned prime down at least 100 times. Suddenly I have prime after an update? Uh what the hell. Plus the app crashed constantly or just stops. No reason. It just stops. I have shopped with amazon for years but this prime thing and the music app both suck. And stop trying to trick or entice me to use it."
636,"Amazon",2016-07-07,5,"Makes Prime worth it. The music selection available with Prime music has been poor in the past but recently I have been very pleased with the selection and have actually had difficulties finding music they do not have. Prime music is definitely a great bonus to the Prime subscription."

646,"Amazon",2014-06-30,2,"Issues downloading to device I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it does not always work and is very frustrating. If they make it more simple and allow music to be stored to external memory card I would be happy and be able to purchase slot of music. I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3"
647,"Amazon",2016-01-23,3,"Fee or not to fee....what was the question? I am not a fan of annual fees that only provide SOME of the service and peretual nickle and dime fees for eternity. Either pay as you go or make the annual subscription all inclusive. Other than that the music that IS included with the subscription fee is pretty extensive so I am kinda just nit picking."
648,"Amazon",2015-07-02,5,"FREE music with no commercials and as many skips as you like... Awesome app. Love love and more love. Gives you the ability to download the playlists and skip anything you want...with no commercials. You can even randomize the playlists and more. I just turn on Bob Marley's greatest hits by the pool. If you are a Prime member there is a MASSIVE selection of music that is...wait for it...completely and totally...FREE!"
649,"Amazon",2016-02-10,5,"Great app...works perfectly !!! Love it.I use it with my local wifi on my Android.Perfect app if you have AmazonPrime and thus have seemingly limitless access to titles that span more than half a century without having to pay for them which makes paying for the occasional title not seem so big a deal."
653,"Amazon",2014-08-10,5,"Essential app to enjoy Prime Music and download free music to your devices If you are a Prime member and enjoy music you will want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings but you will need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."

I love the music streaming but I do not like the movies and books prime memberships. It does not suck but it is not good enough either.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants music all in the one place both at home and when out and about ................."
749,"Amazon",2015-08-01,4,"nice Great but wish I could figure out how to play the different genres as a shuffle since I like to listen to a mix of music. If I could figure out how to play Modern County Top Hip Hop and Latin Pop would give 5stars."

It will stay on up to 60 minutes while you are falling asleep then will turn itself off. I love this feature!"
768,"Amazon",2014-10-21,1,"Make this app compatible with the One Plus One. Until then it is useless to me. No longer compatible with my device so I can not give it anymore than one star. Was awesome when it worked though."

773,"Amazon",2014-01-07,4,"Much Better UPDATE:I got a new Samsung S3 and it seems to work really well on this phone not sure if it was an update to the app or if it just works better on my new phone but the app did not work before on my Evo 3DI do not know what they have done to it but now on my htc evo 3d 4g the widget will not go on the screen even if the home screen is empty it says there is not enough space. The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you do not make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can not even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I would at least raise it back to like 4 stars."
774,"Amazon",2015-09-01,5,"Top of the line! Best music program out there. Not only can I upload all of my own music and listen to it anywhere prime ha's more music than I could ever listen to.

777,"Amazon",2016-09-07,5,"Great for on the go. I have this on my Galaxy Note 4 and it is great. I especially like it because it gives me the ability to use my GPS tracking app when doing my walk or Bike ride and still listen to music without haveing to carry a second device."
783,"Amazon",2016-05-22,3,"Beta Good Idea That Needs Further Crafting IMO Well intentioned but definitely seems to be in a beta version if you will. Could use a car mode voice commands and compatibility with S voice and/or car mode on Samsung Galaxy for optimum usefulness. Thankful for this arm of the Amazon Prime experience!"
784,"Amazon",2012-09-06,2,"Underwhelming The good: It installed easily and does not crash my Android 2.3 phone LG MyTouch Q.The not so good: Mediocre variety and selection of music at best.

790,"Amazon",2016-11-21,1,"This is a terrible app and it is doing all it can to get worse!!! This used to be a serviceable option for those of us not in iPhones but now with their new streaming music service Amazon seems to be rapidly abandoning the non streaming portion part of their music service. they are making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I do not use it. Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can not even get your music from it anymore."

804,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"Good Update Free Music with Prime The newly updated music app for Amazon is pretty good. If you are a Prime member/subscriber you get access to a good amount of free music. All you have to do is update the app and then you get access to Add songs to your library for free. Then you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet but the selection is pretty good. Also the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use to save on data if you are using your phone's plan. You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in. The songs from the playlists are free if you have Prime.App works well and it is great if you have Prime! I would recommend it."
817,"Amazon",2015-04-22,5,"RECOMMENDED! Great perk for Prime Users. it is nice that I can download some of the music and listen when I do not have WIFI."

This is great my only question is why is every time I Iisten there is a loud squelch in the speakers about 30 60 seconds into the first song? To save your hearing my advice is to start the app play a song wait a minute then put in your headphones."
820,"Amazon",2016-12-04,2,"Insists on loading WMP library 1 App used to look good now it is an eyesore.2 When I updated to the new version it decided to automatically load all of my music files from the HD even though I had this turned off on the old version. An hour after launching the program it came up indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production. Great. Unchecked the load from windows media player again the library was back to normal. Now today it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it. This program is not worth it anymore."
821,"Amazon",2016-04-27,1,"Poor app I was so excited to find this app so i could enjoy my prime music on the go but sadly it sucks. Yes i can download music on the go but it does not help when the music wont play or starts buffering and never recovers. I sure hope it will be better in the future"
826,"Amazon",2017-09-29,2,"Mediocre at best Constantly autostart with no ability to stop it from happening. Minimal music sorting features. Errors downloading large music collections and have to restart download."
830,"Amazon",2014-06-12,3,"app needs work The prime music service is great. However the app needs improvements. it is clunky many links into deeper pages are text only when a button would be nicer. You cannot add items to your library without tapping them first where a long press should be able to give that option."

846,"Amazon",2016-02-09,3,"Very nice Prime perk. Lots of good music some free some not. I like that I can listen to any music that I had purchased even when bought on CD.

859,"Amazon",2014-11-28,3,"I like the idea I like the idea and I used to praise the app. Recently however Amazon apps have become hogs of data and battery. I do not know why. But I do not see any good reason for Amazon Music to be running at all after a complete reboot much less becoming the highest user of data and battery!!!A recent update seems to have calmed it down a bit so I am giving it another chance."
860,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Great Product I love the selection and the choices"
861,"Amazon",2015-05-12,4,"Good! One considerable bug could use a few features. I have really enjoyed exploring new music and being able to download it to my device I do not think it has the volume button skip capability even the screen is off that I enjoy as part of Google Play it also will just turn off occasionally forcing me to reopen the app which is annoying and is dangerous/should not be done when driving. Note 4"
868,"Amazon",2017-02-05,5,"Music forever and ever. I have not even dented this service but so far it is pretty darn cool. After adding Prime it got even better. It is so good I purchased a tablet just to store and listen when not at home."

873,"Amazon",2011-04-18,5,"Most Used App in my Phone I use this app both on my EVO phone and my Motorola Xoom tablet and it always works great. I love not having to transfer my songs from the phone to the tablet or viceversa. I connect my phone to my car radio and listen to music as I drive.

910,"Amazon",2015-07-19,3,"No uSD card support; no prime stations; no streaming I like Prime Music especially the prime stations. So much free music with your dollar 99/year membership. I like the app on my Windows desktop. I do not like the app on my Android phone Samsung Galaxy S5 for 3 reasons. First because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music your Amazon Cloud music or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s you either have to forget about them add them to the cloud for a fee or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card I would give the app at least 4 stars. As it is it barely qualifies for 3. Second you can not stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third the prime stations are absent from the Android and the Roku app. what is up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I have purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3 and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available the iTunes and others are not. I do not want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I am only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app and I will revisit my score."

921,"Amazon",2015-02-28,5,"Five Stars Love this app!! Love being able to listen to music wherever I am! :D"
927,"Amazon",2015-10-27,4,"A great add on for prime users A great add on for prime users have found most not all the music I have been looking for. It was obscure tracks either. The interface could be a bit easier. I found navigating the app a bit annoying at times. All in all though I enjoy ad free music for free so very happy with Amazon music."
930,"Amazon",2016-11-12,5,"Great audio player. After exhaustin the music in your collection this simple apps opens a door to an unlimited collection. The audio quality is very good and some songs even have lyrics to help you learn what is son."

937,"Amazon",2014-07-24,2,"Good But Greatly Needs Improvement For Version 4.0.4 App gets the job done and handily let us you access all content. However player seems too simplistic to me and more importantly there is no option to deactivate the app's checking for cloud songs every ten minutes. This deficiency causes the app to monopolize mobile data.Recommend adding an option to toggle off the constant cloud checks and improving player interface."

955,"Amazon",2014-09-26,4,"Great App! Just Bring The Equalizer To The Front. I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside it is one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."

You can not beat Amazon. Thanks Selecto Ruidoso NM"
976,"Amazon",2015-12-02,3,"Okay but not great streamed music. I notice quite a bit of clipping it is not as clean sounding as Pandora running on the same device or machine.

Because I am . . .~ digheyseus on the upside of the download"

It is convoluted and messy."
993,"Amazon",2015-07-15,5,"Thus Far I been using prime music for about a day or so and I love it. They have the music I love and I do not have to worry about stupid commercials.

1012,"Amazon",2016-02-13,4,"Better than it used to be and much smoother playing than Apple music but still leaves much to be desired Well one thing I can say is it certainly works much more smoothly than it used to and the lyrics on screen feature can be quite a bit of fun and helpful but the lack of features like Spotify's old Starred playlist been awhile since I have been over at Spotify and the fact that it is missing so many good standard album tracks or that Amazon expects you to pay extra for them? Really?I am sorry Amazon but you need to do better than that to be considered a full fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon come on. You can do better than that."

1037,"Amazon",2016-05-15,4,"just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app I do not use it as much as I should seeing that if you pay for a Prime Membership one should use the service. Thing is that after you shut it off the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.Second it is hard to find a specific album... let us say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you playlists of groups similar to the Doobies. So I will get my South City Midnight Lady and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway just the grumblings of an old geezer. surprised "

The only way I can change songs is to open the song list but if I want to listen to my current song again I have to change songs first. This is beyond annoying! And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous but ILLEGAL in my state. I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do. This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public. It makes me regret downloading the update."

1468,"Amazon",2016-03-15,1,"Sorry amazon. Dislike the fact I can not use when I am connected to another accounot and do not pay for prime. Me and my father split it thinking we received the same benifits but nope. Disappointed have no use for this app."
1470,"Amazon",2014-12-29,3,"Bait and switch This review refers to the Amazon Prime music library:A lot of re records even on songs that do not specifiy it live versions obscure songs by artists and waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much Christmas music instead of regular music. Streams well and sound quality is good but selection is somewhat disappointing."
1473,"Amazon",2015-11-19,4,"i prefer it to the alternatives Its a real playlist site. Not just a station sight. I prefer to the alternatives. Though it does not have some of the songs I was looking for. But still an amazing site and has an amazing library slection that is easy to use and access."

1496,"Amazon",2016-08-09,5,"Addictive for audiophiles Huge selection especially of music from the 60's 80's. Prices are good if you need to buy them but with Prime you can build a great playlist for your kindle or I phone."
1497,"Amazon",2015-01-05,3,"Battery Killer Takes up too much battery for android. I do not know why but it always says Amazon Music is taking up the most battery. Samsung Galaxy S4.

1547,"Amazon",2016-06-07,4,"Four Stars Only real complaint is the limited library selection"
1551,"Amazon",2013-03-31,4,"Tech Savvy is a Must First I had to download the Amazon Appstore. Then I had to download the Amazon MP3 Player. After I downloaded it to my smartphone I could not find it. I had to open Appstore open the menu select downloaded apps then open the app on my phone. It took me a while to figure it put and the procedures are well hidden. Once I opened it on my smartphone I could listen to my 99 Piano Masterpieces fo 99 cents on my smartphone."

1562,"Amazon",2017-05-03,1,"Complete waste of megabytes Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay dollar 9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay dollar 9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible"
1565,"Amazon",2011-03-31,5,"Works great! The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat ware' on my Moto Defy so I have been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem."

1569,"Amazon",2015-02-06,2,"Great for prime music horrible for your device. It does provide access to the massive online selections but it really does drain your device. Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up. Linked to the amazon store app and altogether they are a mess."
1573,"Amazon",2016-07-16,5,"Way better than I thought Way better than I thought. After years of using Pandora uuugh the ads. Love the Prime stations for genres. Skip all you like repeat great selection for any setting."

1613,"Amazon",2016-08-28,4,"4 Stars for 90 percent Great app but still only have 90 percent of the songs I am looking for. Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all but until then.. 4 stars"

1623,"Amazon",2014-11-26,1,"As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon its Prime Music's desktop version sucks. So much inferior to other widely known streaming platforms. The design of its Android app is also stupid in that I am required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."

1639,"Amazon",2015-11-21,5,"Better than Rhapsody This app is way better than most of the competitors out there. I also have rhapsody and it is horrible unless your somewhere that has a strong wifi signal. This app actually works sometimes with just the mobile network."

1657,"Amazon",2016-04-26,5,"Features are above average All the features available exceeded my expectations from lyrics to instant downloads after a purchase of physical copies of music to the display and layout of the music library."
1660,"Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music is better than Pandora Commercial free Radio. Skip any number of times. Many different genres to choose from. Amazon Music is better than Pandora better than Spotify and better than Sound Cloud."
1662,"Amazon",2011-11-12,3,"Could be killer Pros: plays DRM free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large 18K song music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service will not allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and does not handle changes to playlists well."
1669,"Amazon",2014-04-19,5,"Love this app I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago and I hate how they demand that you pay dollar 150 a year for the service. I did not remember to get online and order new songs every month and wasted my money.I am SO happy with this app. Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime and I do not have to pay a ridiculous amount or anything at all to use this service."

1677,"Amazon",2016-06-22,4,"some of the groups I like are not allowing their material to be offered to stream The only complaint I have is at times it lags and the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like are not allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore THEY groups like Metallica can pucker up and... well let us keep this age appropriate and kid friendly.Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth and it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library it is an awesome tool to have for those I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS at dollar dollar and percent dollar UP moments."
1679,"Amazon",2015-07-09,4,"Solid addition to Prime Not quite as good as Google Play Music as far as subscription services go but it is not a bad addition to Amazon Prime. Who can complain about free music let us be honest I purchased prime for the shipping aspect not the instant video or the music."

1715,"Amazon",2014-12-24,5,"Best Music Selection Prime Music is the best thing I am getting other than free shipping with my Prime memberships.

1724,"Amazon",2015-07-25,4,"Really like this so far Really like this so far. Not quite as intuitive as pandora but no commercials and ability to skip multiple songs makes this worth it."

1738,"Amazon",2014-02-01,5,"Great for my phone This might be free to download but I have to say it probably costs me more money to keep it just for the simple fact that it is too easy to buy songs with it. Over all its great because I can access my purchased songs there are no adds and finding songs are just as easy. Maybe one day they can add it a song finder where the app listens and finds the song?"
1740,"Amazon",2016-06-11,5,"Five Stars a lot of music free to prime members."
1741,"Amazon",2016-01-07,5,"All services should be good for everyone in household Would have been better if the Prime membership has all of the benefits for all in the same house holdi think they give it to 3 household members which is fine but the free music is only for the member."

The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free or when you purchase music from them. that is where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye Amazon. my next tablet will not be a Kindle."

1785,"Amazon",2014-03-25,5,"Great App Is nice that i can download any MP3 purchase directly to my Android Tablet instead of having to hookup the USB cable and transfer it that way. Makes it easier to just move it to the Tablet when I purchase it instead of forgetting to do so until I start looking for the track to listen to and then realize i did not move it over yet. Nice App."

1799,"Amazon",2013-05-29,2,"Was good once...now this app is TERRIBLE! This app used to work great about 3 updates back but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I am looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."

I do not know about you but I prefer to store photos and music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally I do not like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music and I have an awesome stereo in the house so unless I can use this on my tablet why bother????So this is now a 100 percent useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee dollar 20 a year it is just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership."

2043,"Amazon",2011-10-13,5,"Good app but needs on device playlist backup This is an excellent music player and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on device playlist to the cloud and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet resolving it to music already on the device. it is a real problem when you create a playlist of songs and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."

They were stored on my device fine but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I have always installed from the play store let us see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE LG G3 that just might run amazon prime music but it is just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."

This is an added bonus with a Prime membership and as such it is great!The selection is a little limited compared to other music streaming services but that is not a problem for me.they have added new features like radio stations and curated playlists so I find myself using this app and the web player quite frequently.The mobile app allows to download songs and playlists for offline listening so that is a great feature. Though the downloaded songs will not be detected by other media player apps on the device.it is not pushy in trying to make me buy more music. There are no ads.I did not find this app for my smart TV and Blu ray player so that was disappointing.

2424,"Amazon",2015-04-08,2,"it is a great idea. I would change this rating if I could play my Prime music from my sd card. I have allot of memory available but can not even use it. Even if I manually move the Prime downloads to my sd card. The music choice itself is awesome."
2439,"Amazon",2016-06-28,3,"I use it because it comes with Prime When I first downloaded the app it was great. There was a wide selection of music that I could stream integrated with my own music library but after a few days it started to become glitchy. When I opened another music player suddenly I could not see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions. I Uninstaller and reinstalled the app which worked for a few days but the problems just keep reappearing."

The app worked perfectly with totally clear sound.One thing I could wish for: In the case of complete albums it would be nice to select from the artwork rather than scrolling endlessly through all the songs. I have 837 songs mostly from complete albums. To go through that many to select one near the end of the list would be very time consuming. Just a thought."
2449,"Amazon",2012-07-23,4,"was not Compatible with the Acer A510 Reboot and works Contrary to Amazon's claims this app is not compatible with the Acer A510. There is no access to playing music from the cloud . I can browse my music and purchase music but forget playing music.Update Turns out the issue is with the device. A reboot and the app works fine.

2745,"Amazon",2014-12-31,1,"Amazon Music App thumbs down. Down loaded the app and found out it uses a lot of memory about the same amount as the whole Operating System on the phone. did not like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it did not need to access. did not like that at all as it is giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I do not want to give away. Then found out I could not delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information photos media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I do not need to give you and you do not need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app is not very intuitive to use.

It makes it so easy to exercise or walk with and yet I can relax and read to the music also. The different groups such as amazon music for walking update constantly and I do not have to go to the web site to do it. Makes listening to the music fantastic. My only problem with this is that I can access movies while traveling outside of the US but not the music You have to download it. Hurry up and get the musical access also!"
2976,"Amazon",2011-03-25,3,"VERY basic No user controls Poor documentation. It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the cloud player so even though this app has the same name as the current one there may be significant changes in how it works now. You can search listen to samples and buy songs with this app. However there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one click purchases to make it work.This is a very basic app which is a good thing to some degree... that is what keeps it simple. I am glad it is not trying to be everything under one roof. I do not want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However it is so limited that it is hard to feel like it is easy to use because the limitations require other work arounds.~~~Shopping Experience:~~~When shopping for songs or albums there is no description reviews or anything else other than the artist title and a date which is not explained is that the release date or what?.Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. it is quite easy to search for a song quickly find it and listen to a sample before buying. it is great if you are not sure what song you are looking for.There are some strange things about it though. For example several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name artist and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for dollar .99 and dollar .89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you are getting.There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet but the way this works makes it seem as though there is going to be a separate dollar .99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my balance without paying for each separately. I do not want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however so I am not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. it is all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I would not have to commingle settings with my web shopping.Also there seems to be no way to retrieve previously purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? that is not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so called convenience of the apps simplicity.~~~App Experience:~~~Because there are no user controls you can not specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own even after refreshing the media list and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.Finally the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self explanatory mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with it is takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically it is not a mobile friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone yet they are not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.~~Summary:~~~As powerful a site as amazon.com is I am a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I am away from my computer and desperately want a song right away."

3508,"Amazon",2013-09-21,1,"Used to be good but not anymore. Recent changes in the app make it nearly unusable. It used to show how much of a song from my cloud player was downloaded so to avoid buffering issues I could pause the song until 1/4 or so was downloaded then begin playing. Now with no download status it is just blind guessing.Additionally I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again. When I try now it skips back to the beginning of the song so I have to listen to the whole song again. it is like a super cheap MP3 player. I pay for cloud storage to listen to songs on the go but the app now makes it difficult."

4529,"Amazon",2016-02-01,3,"Unfinished Product There is no music history or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing. I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked and now will never hear it again since there is no way to undo this action. Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error. it is also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations or only the current station for instance I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on. Rating the song on one station should not affect the other. If this behavior was better documented and a simple rating history feature was implemented Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I am already an Amazon Prime member. number AnthonyNaddeo get busy and fix this for me."

4542,"Amazon",2017-04-25,1,"Amazon music app is abysmal and should be avoided at all cost This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse. It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often. Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along. All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album for some reason it did not add them to my phone. I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them nope apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon I expect more."

4803,"Amazon",2014-11-27,1,"Disappointed! This application will give you nothing but trouble. I am so disappointed!"
4807,"Amazon",2012-09-25,1,"So is anyone besides me upset? nay mad? So last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. Seriously? Google? I expect it from Microsoft every MS Windows based music player I have ever touched has been below lame. I did not care for Pandora I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it is MP3 then store it all here!! SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that will not ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes and on an old iPod Photo 60G. The 4g iPod still lives but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom. So over the next few weekends I open the laptop start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. A Samsung Charge on Verizon a nice phone good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill City ID is one that is dollar 2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!After a month I was all done.Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs 250 how laughable! NOT! ... unless I pay dollar 24.95 a year?Even though the price is reasonable I still feel like for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year 5Gigs is free I used my allotment and no more. When they said it is free! I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind to the tune of dollar 25 bucks a year just months later?And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. I only traveled 25K miles last month go figure!! Now I have to re rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I have got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P A I N F you L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out M A D MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot download an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap promise. I am just that mad.Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The Artist column can not be expanded for example. You can not sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues but yea now my playlists are gone unless I fork over dollar 24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn tooting be nicely functional ok?Last the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a you must agree to this message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app the Amazon Marketplace app the Amazon Price Checker app the Amazon Student app The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal happy down to earth self... next year sometime!!!Yes. I am just that mad."

I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access.The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was.

7370,"Amazon",2013-01-14,3,"A perfectly decent solution Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this. it is a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone. And the player is...acceptable. It plays music and does not glitch up trying to do it.However the more you use the player the more you will find it is not all you want. you will listen to an album and then it will just stop; it will not keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward but just slightly off somehow. you will want to do one thing and you will accidentally do another. you will never have a MAJOR problem with the media player but it is not the perfect answer.If you want something with tons of options and personalization look elsewhere for your music app. If you are looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs stop right here."

7699,"Amazon",2013-03-08,1,"Convinced me to never buy another MP3 from Amazon ever again The app insists on keeping any downloaded files on internal memory and not on the SD card. there is no configuration option for changing the library location.While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to wifi only and to not automatically download new purchases my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I would purchased eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T Mobile data plan to do it. If I was not paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download but the application kept chugging along giving me no way to STOP the downloads.The application can not be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems. If you install it be sure to have an unlimited data plan or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.I am going to try and find a resolution for these bugs but if I can not find one I am uninstalling the application."

Selection is limited but they do actually add new content frequently almost weekly. All genres R covered classical new age country alternative etc. even explicit rap tunes and kids stuff. I cant say how well selection is 4ea but looks like in general there is a ok 2good amt free including recent releases. there is also PRIME playlists you can stream or download with categories from rock or rap yr workouts and classical 4reading soothe baby etc. first music app I have had was iTunes so incomparison with buying everything 4stars.. ITunes does have quite the selection so 1 4that! second app I have used and most recent was Google play so I am probly biased but I liked format listing top songs related artists which amazon sorta does and artist mini bio which amazon does not. Plus Google play dollar 9.99mo unlimited so I was inclined 2stay but as Prime member thought I would check it out. Prime perks R 5star where else is it free despite limited selection.

10405,"Amazon",2013-02-13,1,"HATE this app HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings deselect auto download select it again and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself does not indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that is too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it and it makes me HATE Amazon."

10533,"Amazon",2016-11-19,1,"Great if it works. Loved it at first. It was pre installed bloatware on my Note 5 but since I was a Prime member I started using it. Lots of great music easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache no change Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it is possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally."

10580,"Amazon",2014-09-05,1,"Not all its made up to be. There are many popular songs that are unavailable. You can not download any songs to your computer hard drive you have to work in the cloud. If you find a song that you like you may have to pay for it. I guess I had the wrong idea about it. I thought all songs would be free and available to do anything that I wanted to do with them. This is not the case it seems to be very restrictive. So as you peel back the layers of the onion its not all its cracked up to be."
10590,"Amazon",2013-03-12,5,"great app selecion I was very surprised at how easy it is to get the apps you need/want on here.You shall not be disappointed."
10593,"Amazon",2013-03-28,1,"Use to love it now I hate it. This was my go to music player on my phone. I liked it more than any other and I purchased music from Amazon on occasion. But then it started to say that it could not play music on my device. So I investigated and Amazon changed the game. Now you have to pay dollar 24.99 a year for their service. do not get me wrong if you want a cloud service that is a decent deal. I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone. that is all. For giving me a nice player they got my business when I needed to purchase a song. But that is gone and I switched to Google Play Music. It will do. I do not like it as much yet but I haven't used it long. And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song. I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone."

10865,"Amazon",2011-04-19,5,"Great App a couple changes suggested I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player. I have put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that are not mp3 to mp3. Its not necessary but if it did do that I would not need to open iTunes for much of anything.Great updates."

It used to be it would crash when I tried to play the free songs I downloaded to my device but now it will not play ANY songs.Spotify and other music players work fine still on this device..."
10907,"Amazon",2012-08-21,1,"can not believe these people You got another thing coming if you think 250 songs is worth anything. At least put the limit at 5GB."
10909,"Amazon",2012-11-24,3,"It works It is a app to download music and it worksIt is a app to download music and it works"
10910,"Amazon",2011-07-22,2,"The most usefl app ever... hahahahah that was funny... I hardly ever use it. Most of my music will not show up on it. Its problaby because of how it was ripped. Needs more codec support I guess ???."
10912,"Amazon",2014-01-04,5,"Music Music and more Music! This is a great app for my phone mp3 player and tablet. If I do not want to sync to my music on my toys I can still hear them all thru cloud. I like buying singles a lot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do a lot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!"
10913,"Amazon",2011-12-31,1,"Not US version..... This is UK only. Prices show in pounds an no cloud drive access. Worthless and cant uninstall. 18 19 2o words to post????!!!"
10916,"Amazon",2011-10-04,1,"No longer great Shame on amazon. This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen nor can you search for it through the app!!!! : "
10924,"Amazon",2011-04-09,3,"change log? Maybe it is just me but I refuse to update if the developer will not take the time to write up a change log.what was fixed? what was added?"
10932,"Amazon",2011-10-09,1,"No more free song Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star."
10933,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"DOES NOT WORK No trace of this app on my kindle tech support says to be patient why should I be patient? If something is not ready do not put it on your website or store shelves. Bought a kindle fire just to use this app but it does not exist."
10936,"Amazon",2015-03-03,1,"it is almost like they do not want you to use it Oh man...I was really hoping this would allow me to get rid of Spotify Premium and save some dollar dollar each month. False. This app has one of the least user friendly interfaces I have ever experienced. it is almost like they do not want you to use it...I am really hoping they get this fixed because it was a large part of why I renewed my Prime membership for another year."
10937,"Amazon",2016-12-25,1,"does not work Keeps on giving me an authentication error exception number 117"
10938,"Amazon",2011-04-26,4,"Keeps getting better The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up."
10940,"Amazon",2016-09-28,1,"Garbage! Will not install This crap will not install! Tried numerous times read tons of reviews of others with the same problem. Amazon tech can not get it to work either. This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also they are consistently late but they are late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS. ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!! Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
10941,"Amazon",2014-10-27,4,"A Must for Amazon Prime Subscribers This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available. Works equally well on my Kindle Nexus 7 tablet and Android phone Galaxy S 5. Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services. The pre selected playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good. I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account. I have not purchased any songs or albums. The app itself is clean straightforward and easy to use."
10946,"Amazon",2016-06-07,1,"do not Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. did not get the song version right cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!"
10949,"Amazon",2014-10-15,4,"Mostly great it is almost fabulous. I do not have an iPhone so I can not get my iTunes unless I am at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I am out and about. My one star less is because there is no way that I have found to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes but I will wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise I am enjoying my tunes : "
10955,"Amazon",2014-02-18,2,"not what i was expecting To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.Unfair it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
10956,"Amazon",2011-08-24,1,"A piece of garbage App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket it closes. Put your phone on your desk closes. Music stops and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning interruption point was not savedAll this on our 2 phones different models so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
10960,"Amazon",2014-10-21,3,"Money Talks Eh? I think it is great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone. Since it is bundled with Prime Instant Video I am not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the dollar 99.00 that I am being charged. When I want to buy something I am told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee I live abroad. However when I signed up Amazon gladly accepted my you.S. credit card. do not you think that is a bit hypocritical?"
10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App I can not get enough of Amazon prime music. The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go to app. The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10962,"Amazon",2014-10-31,4,"Great extra with the prime membership Great extra with the prime membership. I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have. I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music. It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly. I already pay for netflix hulu plus beats music and wwe network monthly to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
10963,"Amazon",2015-01-10,1,"I would give it 0 starts if I could. AWFUL app It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone a brand new Samsung S5. I never could get it to recognize my amazon account so I could not stream prime music or even retrieve albums I have purchased. It was a huge resource and battery hog too. After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it. Canceled my prime membership too."
10973,"Amazon",2016-10-01,5,"Five Stars ok"
10980,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"Amazon Prime Music I am excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. it is early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I am curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I will go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. it is Amazon I am sure it will be a great product in no time."
10987,"Amazon",2016-01-19,2,"Great idea but annoying I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload which is a pain in the butt.Secondly the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack which means it is practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.Back to Google play music I go. mad"
10990,"Amazon",2017-09-17,5,"Five Stars I love the instant rip and available music with my prime subscription."
10992,"Amazon",2011-06-30,1,"This program is not just bad its damaging. I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."
10996,"Amazon",2017-09-25,1,"One Star Worthless if you can not get the prime member music"
11002,"Amazon",2015-01-14,5,"Five Stars Easy to use great selection of free music if you are a prime member."
11003,"Amazon",2013-01-20,4,"Good This is good app to store most not all my music only because I haven't paid the dollar 25 annual fee. Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources PC tablet or cell. If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!"
11005,"Amazon",2013-02-10,5,"The BEST I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can not sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere.IT IS AWESOME....DownLOAD it now...why are you still reading this..go download."
11006,"Amazon",2014-10-09,5,"Amazon Rocks. Just want to say Thank You Amazon.Since I love music so much you made it so easy to listen to them.I love the many choices I have to listen to not limited to just certain ones.So easy to find and navigate and explore.I even told my family and friends to join up. They sure wont be disappointed at all.Keep up the Good Work.Love Ya Guys."
11007,"Amazon",2017-05-05,4,"Four Stars there is some decent music on it but the variety is limited."
11010,"Amazon",2013-02-12,1,"Music only on internal storage? This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company."
11011,"Amazon",2017-10-08,5,"Good music Good app easy to use.good music."
11017,"Amazon",2017-04-29,5,"Five Stars you got music any time any where"
11019,"Amazon",2017-03-25,5,"Answers All Of My Music Needs For Now Very good deal for dollar 8 per month!"
11028,"Amazon",2014-10-24,1,"OnePlus and Ouya compatibility Hugely unstable on OnePlus One and apparently other OPO devices for several subsequent releases. Unusably flaky on an Ouya. Amazon kindly flags the app as uninstallable on the OnePlus in the Google Play store but still enables access to the app on both devices through their own. Left hand meet right hand. Or better yet: Just fix it."
11029,"Amazon",2014-06-17,5,"Yay! Finally! This is great so far I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music so the transition was not bad for me. My only criticism is that their catalog for streaming is not that big but I understand that this is because the service is brand new. I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase. Thank you Amazon!"
11033,"Amazon",2017-07-01,5,"Five Stars Love it"
11034,"Amazon",2014-04-23,4,"App works well. I like being able to get my Cloud music and play it on my phone. The one problem I have with it is that without me adding them in there it picked up ringtones I had downloaded to my phone and put them in my list of songs. I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well."
11036,"Amazon",2013-02-25,5,"Great APP It took two neices and three freinds to convience me to get this app to help me work my new tablet and they were right. This is a great app to find other great apps. I am not sure I would ever be able to work the computer but now I have all types of helpful and fun apps on my tablet thanks to Amazon and my family."
11047,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"Ejoying The Benefits of Prime!!!! I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash. What I liked most of all was the access to the many music playlists that are available and also the music that had been on my wish list for years were made available through Prime. Thank you. Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
11052,"Amazon",2012-11-10,5,"Streaming on Nexus7 I use this app on my Nexus7 and have had no problems. Streams my purchased music and personal uploads to my tablet with no problems."
11055,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"... music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to I listen to a LOT of music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to. And it is really great to have all this available on my desktop laptop tablet and phone! SIMPLY WONDERFUL! The recent updates to the music app make it easy to use. GOOD WORK AMAZON!"
11058,"Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Not for me even though free. Not bad but too commercial oriented toward selling tracks and albums. Just no way I am gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it is free for Prime members.Going back to Rhapsody."
11061,"Amazon",2014-10-19,2,"Not bad but could be a lot better. A bit disappointed with Amazon music especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members even if it was all included it still wouldnt be that good They are missing a lot of amazing artists Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
11062,"Amazon",2016-02-25,5,"Dope Dope"
11066,"Amazon",2014-10-13,2,"from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime. I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song."
11067,"Amazon",2017-01-16,1,"Music Purchase Frustrating I do not know why I have to install your music app to purchase music. Very frustrating."
11068,"Amazon",2017-07-01,1,"Use pandora instead This used to be a great app before they got money hungry. As it Prime member you used to be able to download a lot of music onto my phone and play it later to save data. But now they have updated it and I have to pay to be able to do that. They are taking way too many perks away from Prime members. Even their movie app is not as good as it was So now I just use Pandora. If this keeps up I will drop my prime membership!"
11069,"Amazon",2013-04-13,4,"Simple but Helpful it is a nice app but there is not a ton to do with it which is fine because you are just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all nothing bad to say."
11075,"Amazon",2011-03-31,1,"bug report on keyboard detection Hello. The app is refusing to start because my keyboard has language EnglishItaly since the phone was bought in Italy I am actually in the US.Could you just check that the language string starts with english ?"

Looks like we will not be keeping the Prime account after all sad"
11082,"Amazon",2015-07-16,3,"sucker price I was disappointed on the Super Wednesday prime day when they advertised a fish finder for a low price but when you opened it up it was more than 25 times the advertised price.Really gets your attention. .... but do not deliver."
11086,"Amazon",2011-08-16,5,"works This is a pretty good application I think that it could use a refresh here and there though. Otherwise a good app"
11089,"Amazon",2011-05-18,3,"Just ok My greatest beef with Amazon player is how limited the settings are on the player itself. I love crossfading between tracks. Get this feature and I will make this my default player. Until then not so much."
11090,"Amazon",2014-10-12,4,"I love to use this app I love to use this app. The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due. I am not sure I can justify dollar 99 for this privilege. It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music."
11091,"Amazon",2014-10-20,5,"Five Stars So easy to use! Love it!"
11096,"Amazon",2014-10-27,1,"NOT USEFUL AMAZON! Even with Prime you still have to pay for songs or albums! You only get snippets of the music for free then are required to purchase the individual song or album to hear it in it is entirety. NOT USEFUL AMAZON!"

11109,"Amazon",2016-01-09,4,"Easy To Use I love this app but could be easier to search for specific albums and tracks."
11110,"Amazon",2011-05-17,4,"Keeps my SD space free. Not the greatest looking mp3 player around but good enough. Functions well though network hiccups are common. Fits a need till Google Music goes public."
11111,"Amazon",2014-10-17,5,"LOVE this!!!! Oh my gosh! I love this app!!! Now I can have all my favorite songs with me on my computer and phone. Easier to load and access than my i pod which is now in the drawer! Best of all my songs were FREE!!!!"

If a download of purchased tracks fails which it usually does the Download Failed message can not be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running since some process of it is ALWAYS running.

11679,"Amazon",2015-01-13,1,"If its not broke fix it until it is!! I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available. I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet. This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had meaning songs I did not download from Amazon. I have my entire library on random so after the twentieth track of very old music I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists. I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device why would not they be? yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I am offline. Even albums I have purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app. I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members System of a Down 311 Disturbed etc yet for some reason the app does not want to play them anymore unless I am connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet then viola!! all my downloaded content plays. But think about this for a moment what is the purpose of downloading for offline play if I can only play them when I am online? I do not know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for. I am not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 10 hours I am at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library does not work. My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."
11680,"Amazon",2016-05-24,1,"From reasonably useful to completely worthless in one update I like its customizable folders album and artist options but it sucks up WAY too much data to be regularly useful.Update October 2016I finally got used to the process of uploading and customizing and they changed the whole thing preventing the organizing of folders songs albums as we would like. Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy with side bars expanding and extremely difficult to simply look through folders.This is absolutely terrible. If I hadn't spent so much time putting stuff on to it I would never use nor continue with it."

Why do we have to allow them to set up accts delete accts use all our google accts at will change and delete apps and other data and on and on... Am I a bit more of a dummy than I thought? Why on earth would they need people to agree to things I would let my own mother have access to? Well maybe mom... Lol If anyone can help me make sense of this I could really use the eye opener. But I really can not see myself going for it... Shaking my head..."
11691,"Amazon",2015-09-05,5,"High quality app/service intuitive really enjoying thus far I only recently started using the Prime Music app and after uploading my own music matched by Amazon and finding some Prime music that I was happy to find is available free with Prime am very happy with Amazon Music thus far. I briefly tried Google Music and two popular music streaming apps Pandora and Songza and my Amazon Music experience has been infinitely better. I had a few technical questions initially re: uploading my music using PC and iPhone etc. that were not addressed online and support for Amazon Music was available right away very knowledgeable and spot on I now realize as far as recommendations made.Now that I am routinely playing music and adding or deleting individual songs from my library etc. my impression is that more thought and planning went into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other options I have explored. it is very intuitive; graphics are very professional and consistent; it is very responsive I have not yet anyway experienced any lag or technical glitches; there is no annoying behavior by the app to aggressively encourage you to buy music unless you have expressed that interest; and one feature I really appreciate no ads pop up or otherwise. Quality of stream is excellent.My impression is that Amazon wisely realizes that this app nicely integrates with their business model and complements their core mission; that is if the app works well and people have a very nice experience it becomes a very sticky service i.e. enhances loyalty and overall impressions of Amazon and encourages more people to join or continue their membership with Prime. In any event they have done a very nice job designing and implementing this service and accompanying app and I am really enjoying it."
11701,"Amazon",2016-10-12,1,"Was an excellent app till a recent update now it is crash city.

11703,"Amazon",2015-01-16,1,"How bad can it get? I have purchased 894 songs from 146 albums. When I purchase new music it is simply impossible to tell what has already been downloaded. Drag music here to download? WHAT??? This is a computer for crying out loud. can not you TELL ME what has not already been downloaded? Present me with a list? DOWNLOAD ALL???Drag to a list to download? I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into and I have been in computers since 1972. THE WORST I have ever run into!It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud make play lists and stream it off the cloud. The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone which I then listen to in my car or out in public. The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house. My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband but it just does not work AT ALL out in the world. I need to download to my devices. ALL OF THEM! All my music.Let me repeat AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO. And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.Sadly Amazon does not care nor do they read these comments so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.Buying the music is dead simple and I like to support the artists and listen to the music I love. Buy getting it to my devices.WOOF what nightmare!!!"
11708,"Amazon",2017-08-19,1,"Amazon Music Android Since the latest update this app has become the biggest piece of trash that ever came out! Where do I begin here? Lack of staying on the lock screen when paused or not automatically resuming when you receive and end a phone call! Prime music being unable to find horrible searching abilities! I am on the verge of cancelling my amazon prime music and going with something else since some idiot screwed up a perfectly functional app!!! I listen to my music while driving in my driving job and this piece of garbage has become so un user friendly! I can not keep messing with it while driving it needs to work as it used to. They need to fire the jerk that messed this app up! I need the apk file and complete instructions for install and BLOCKING this newest update piece of trash from ever getting into my phone!"
11710,"Amazon",2014-01-06,1,"ALWAYS RUNNING!!! This app is a huge resource hog. It has a setting called refresh cloud library that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not. The setting does not give you the option to disable that check or even change the time interval. Hate apps that do not let you control if/when they run and drain your battery."
11712,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Getting better with age I have been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating. The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers. It is truly a great value added service."
11715,"Amazon",2016-05-11,1,"An Audiophile's Nightmare As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities for work as a musician and personal use I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason terrible organization storage and RAM hog causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime I guess I am stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music. Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service and assume some of my payment is going to app development I am highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app does not work."
11720,"Amazon",2017-09-18,3,"App almost tolerable; Incompetent Music Unlimited Support Numerous issues with this app. Music not playing with errors including music that I Own . Creates duplicate offline playlists EVERY time you download music to device. Very inconsistent loudness levels across albums / artists. Limited features when connected to modern vehicle entertainment systems compared to competitive music streaming services. And I am a Music Unlimited subscriber!Amazon Support virtually useless. it is a vicious yet very polite circle of getting absolutely NOTHING done. I have sent app logs so many times I can click through my phone blindly in a matter of seconds. Amazon Support has yet to act or provide a we found a problem response.Send logs; Provide more info; Thank you now please call us; Thanks for the call please provide more written information; Sorry for these problems please send us your log files then REPEAT Indefinitely.Over 4 weeks of this and no solutions. One of the support engineers I spoke to also experiences similar issues with the app so why are these issues not addressed / corrected?"
11722,"Amazon",2016-06-08,3,"Deletes playlists I have been a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appeared. And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop but I am not going to risk testing it either since I am talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.After a few weeks of listening to my music offline which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music gone poof! The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure I remember which one is which since the last century. The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable would not it?Reminds me of when ms quit selling music their player crapped out and amz stepped in."
11724,"Amazon",2016-03-16,3,"Good but Amazon Prime Music has a lot of adapting to attract Millennials and stay ahead of other streaming music options. For the most part I am enjoying Prime music both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white middle class mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres. I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1 year subscription. However I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.So far I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists albums and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I am definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access. At this point in time as a business woman and a graduate student I feel that the dollar 50/year student membership fee is not worth it and most definitely not the regular membership fee."

I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs and limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it External SD card it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to wifi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors Which it does on a regular basis you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review."
11727,"Amazon",2017-11-11,2,"If you want the best app ever and have the dollar dollar for it find something else. Prime music is actually so so. The Amazon music app is okay. I use it almost everyday. I am content with the selection provided occassionaly frustrated by an album I can not listen to.There have been a few errors with the program I have experienced. But the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music. Somedays I will hop in my car excited to listen to some tunes. I click on the app. And I wait a moment. Then some more moments...and it is still loading.So a little frustrated I will start driving. It could not take that long could it?Sometimes it will come up after maybe 5 minutes or so. Other times 15 minutes down the road The screen still has not popped up.Usually. After reaching my destination I will close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.I do not know about programming though I know I have a higher end phone so I can not say 100 percent who is at fault here but from the looks of it others have the same problem with this app.Anyhow. I will likely keep using it. I have been roped in with prime this is basically free only a few bucks a month and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I have come across.it is not convenient. I do not like it. But it will do."
11729,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Terrible Service It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there . For a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from . I can download music to my phone or use Pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache"
11733,"Amazon",2014-09-27,1,"There are better apps out there This app is an absolute mess. If and when it works properly it will only work that way for a short period of time. For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app which worked great this an upgraded version of that app that is just completely missed the mark.I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud. So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists you can easily get those. that is really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.My current issues with this app: Freezing This app freezes constantly. I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work. Each time I boot up the app it will be at my last play point freeze give me the stopped working message and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page. Unresponsive Controls It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens. it is actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up. Finally when I accept that I can not skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs. Unresponsive Quick Bar When in the Songs screen the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works. And it never fails it always stops working when I am on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better. Playlists that do not shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it. Always have to choose repeat and shuffle. Sometimes you just know the song you want to start with. Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re choose repeat and shuffle or it will just start going in order. The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.I will admit most of my complaints are when isolated an annoyance. But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast. The only reason I continue to use this app is because I have invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music. I will admit Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.If you do not have a huge investment in Prime Music and you are just looking for a music app definitely look elsewhere.If improvements and fixes are made to the app I will come back and update my review."
11737,"Amazon",2014-06-13,1,"can not figure out how to play songs while offline I only want certain songs downloaded to my kids' devices and I do not want them to be able to purchase music. With the previous version I could log in on their device download the song they wanted and then log out. They could easily find and play their songs. After the most recent update I can not figure out how to get to their songs without being logged in. When you open the app it prompts you to log in before you can do anything. I tried just finding their music and playing it through android's music player but amazon songs do not show up as music. I was able to dig around and find them but it was a hassle. I can choose the amazon player to play each song individually but the other functions do not seem to work. I have to go through the file system for each song. At least once I did that my device recognized the files as music so I can use the android music player. UGH."
11739,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"You just lost a customer! Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I did not have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I am not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again. Bad move Amazon! I will not use iTunes so now I am in search of a different provider. great job you just lost a customer."
11740,"Amazon",2015-09-27,1,"Barely functional This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app but even after I have got that done there is no way to get this app to respect my folder structure so when browsing by say Artist I have got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching is not terrible except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at say m there is no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I am moved to a different search tab. This is not rocket science the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you are this app is doing is not better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it is laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. there is a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I am forced to use it when say interacting with my Echo."
11741,"Amazon",2016-01-07,2,"let us you DL your music directly to MicroSD; still no gapless play or equalizer still needs major work Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card which I understand was a problem with Android not Amazon the problem occurred with many other non Amazon apps.That being said... this app still needs major work.DLs of music I bought/own do not always work but there is no indication from the app that they did not complete. So you think you have the whole song and instead you have only half or less.On top of that it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.As a Prime user I am allowed to DL some Prime music I do not own for offline listening. Sometimes that works and sometimes it does not. The app will not tell you why.there is no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade which this app also does not let you do.there is NO graphic equalizer. Again there are free music player apps that do this!"
11742,"Amazon",2016-08-12,5,"Great music app! Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off line airplane mode to save battery life if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG G3 updated last night 08 11 16 the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully I still have it on my tablet."
11745,"Amazon",2015-09-22,5,"Best app ever!!! I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it is crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it."
11753,"Amazon",2016-12-10,2,"Not a robust Music source Several issues with this software/service. It does not work on Roku yet except to access my purchased music. can not find other music or playlists. Then on my BLU Advance 5 phone Android from Amazon the app hogs itself into the main memory of the phone and will not move to the added SD card. As a result like other Amazon apps they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.Overall on other platforms I do not find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music building playlists or creating stations of my own. At this stage I am staying on Pandora."
11756,"Amazon",2016-11-13,1,"Keeps closing The app keeps closing for no reason. It used to be a great app and always opened automatically when connected to Sync. Now it will not stay open. I have to keep switching back to FM while driving because Amazon Music closed. Please fix this!"
11757,"Amazon",2017-03-09,1,"Worst music player You buy music with this app but you can not play it on any of your new devices. it is the worst. It does not let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called Ah fiddlesticks which means... awe our music software can not play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.Oh and then it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device. What kind of non sense is that?Asked a friend who tried Amazon Music once if it is even worth trying to register a device and he said Amazon Music has the worst possible audio software and makes your high quality mp3's sound very very bad. "
11758,"Amazon",2017-09-25,2,"This app needs work... I have 2 major complaints about the Amazon Music Android app.1. When playing music OFF line from tracks that have already been downloaded to my device playback frequently pauses as if it is having a buffering problem similar to a streaming ON line connection. the interruptions to playback are incredibly annoying and do not happen on any other music player using the same device.2. There is no way to auto play music on bluetooth connect. When I start my car I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established. The Amazon Music app does not support this feature. I have tried using other apps Bluetooth AutoStart and others and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone it will transfer over to the car and keep playing but that is only if the Music app is already running.For example... Black Player music app will auto play on bluetooth connect from a cold start. Black Player does not need to be running. It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off. This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you do not want it...If Black Player can do it... why can not Amazon?"
11762,"Amazon",2017-04-20,3,"Amazon Music getting better but not quite great yet.. So I am an unlimited Amazon Music subscriber and some pros/cons sticking tongue out ros:1. Huge quantity of music to select from2. Family plan works for my whole family thank you Amazon for finally making this available.3. Integrated with AlexaCons:1. Stations and playlists are not curated/updated. Unlike Pandora or many other music services the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same. For instance any time you start the Classical station the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma EVERY TIME.. Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations.2. Variety of playlists and stations suck. They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3 4 5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you. I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion with commercials just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like. My kids use Spotify the majority of the time for this reason as well.I am sure Amazon will eventually catch up but with all their resources they are very slow to add them."

11795,"Amazon",2016-04-15,1,"Amazon Music so far it is CRAP This Amazon Music software is crap. it is as if they shoved it out the door without ever testing it. Just to address the playlist aspect although there is plenty more that stinks. First I tried to import playlists from iTunes. It had the names of them OK and I checked all the boxes but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music. Not the songs in the playlists not the names of the playlists themselves. Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music. I could create them OK but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked. Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I would check a song or two to add to a playlist and the screen would inexplicably refresh erasing my checkmarks and re setting to the beginning of the alpha list.Whoever they had developing this software they should fire them. Whoever they had testing it they should fire them. Oh they should fire the designers too. it is clunky and it does not work."

I am going to look for a different place to purchase music I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty horrible uncooperative freezing non working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose ho with where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non working software down the throats of your customers you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can not spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads the freezing the crashing. it is the end of my business purchasing music here and I buy a LOT of music.

For example if I download My Life from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits it will try to play Only the Good Die Young even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it.

I do like that it gives you the opportunity to listen to and download music that I would not normally listen to or search for.

There is nothing special about Amazon music unlimited that would make me want to pay an additional dollar 7.99 fee to get what used to be included with Prime at no additional charge. As far as the music app it works okay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control. I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can not add anything else without paying an additional dollar 25 a year another Amazon gotcha. They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbook. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks.

When I am done listening to it there is no way to shut it off without either logging out so than I have to login the next time rather than just opening the app or force quit it through application manager. Also if it is not on and my phone connects to my car's bluetooth the music just randomly starts playing."

I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results.The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube Hulu and Netflix just fine but I can not listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping.The selection is limited.Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts that under water sound.At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes.

I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I look forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part.

Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded did not show up. On the phone and trying to get to music via the cloud Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you have already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice: Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."

Love Amazon music! it is great for listening to purchased music and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free not really free because you pay for a prime membership but it is a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi perfect for airplanes. Would recommend this!!!"
11876,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"promising but... I love Prime music but the delivery system download/streaming could be greatly improved. There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently. Play button is still activated but shutting it off and starting it back on does not resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen novel concept. I think the song rotation is better than I Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."

I can not believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle Spotify etc. The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap. But functionally it it terrible. I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired. Amazon you can do better with the almost unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best but if this is what you are willing to invest in this users please go elseware."

11883,"Amazon",2016-11-04,2,"Prime Unlimited Good Value iPhone App just So So Echo integration Poor I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think dollar 7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons easy things to fix:1. On the App make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said most other music apps are just as poor in this area not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full. So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it will not try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for offline music.Now the Cons harder to fix or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse it does not even shuffle on the command Echo Shuffle My Music or Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account . On this command echo starts with the same songs until I say shuffle again and skip a song. Then it says enabling shuffle mode and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10 000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the dollar 25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to number 3 when I do use the shuffle command it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again a month ago this was opposite I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play only Prime songs will shuffle now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time. If this improves I will update my review."

Being the best online retailer on the web I was sure that this was the place to let my teen buy music for their Android phone.. until it FILLED UP THE PHONE'S SYSTEM MEMORY!! You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates going forward involves taking out the SD card periodically and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!! do not BOTHER to suggest third party apps that can not GUARANTEE that all album images will move with the mp3s and be accessible by the CLOUD.

We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I have never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall I am glad I have it but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."

I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me."

This is ridiculous! If one purchases Prime for a household then everyone in the family should have access to the music. Music was a huge reason we purchased Prime. It was a great disappointment when we discovered only one person in our household could access the music. It made our overall opinion of Prime less attractive for our family."
11918,"Amazon",2014-12-06,4,"I think prime is overrated The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue. One minute your movie and music are there. The next minute they are gone. without warning. At least with netflix there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service. Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers. The 2 day shipping is great but that part is not always executed to perfection especially when it comes to third party sellers marketplace. You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth. The media selection part of prime music and movies is barely good enough."

My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song it is not the right one.

The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums. You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library. I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs. This interface change has made the music app useless to me and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place. I really hope to see this addressed soon."

11929,"Amazon",2014-03-25,1,"App does not store MP3s on External SD like other services puts songs in wrong order splits albums up and corrupts track names 1. The Amazon MP number player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.2. The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish looking item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_disc_1_02_ _you are_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we will not let you store the music on external storage.3. I have over 11 000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. There are many albums produces in a certain order and Amazon screws this up been like this for years. Never fix it3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album so and so and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep third parties and the music industry out of it."

In addition to causing my phone to choke into freeze mode the app is not easy to use. Furthermore it will not let you put your Amazon bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition it heavily favors streaming which is not why I buy MP3 albums! I want to have the MP3 on my device to save on data and play when I have no signal. Not everyone lives where they have good constant signal! This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using only this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non Amazon music without choking my phone to death maybe I would use it. This is far below Amazon's usual stellar standards."

Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I have desired for awhile now however you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I am even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I am giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing!"
11953,"Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"Not bad unless your device has small built in storage or you have poor data connection. UPDATE:I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface this is not a bad thing. But the problem is when you do not have solid data coverage or wifi like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync the app freezes and you can not do anything but force close it.Ideally there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.___________I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. it is actually not a bad app even if you do not have Prime or do not purchase music. It recognizes/plays non DRM music that is already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple responsive and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it is much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads unless you pay up.I will also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. it is really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card but not any of the music. In a perfect world we would have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."

11973,"Amazon",2014-06-16,2,"New update leaves much to be desired While it is very convenient to have my Amazon music on my phone this app still leaves much to be desired. The previous version of the app was very good allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1 You can not store music on an SD card and 2 You can not sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise it was a very good music player.However with the new update I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches it is almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows songs take FOREVER to load even when they are on my device! I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song will not change although the song title text and album art will!. It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I am quite certain it is not my device I am using a Galaxy SIII on which all other apps just fine. I am giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice but that does not really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.Very disappointed as releasing something this rough is very un Amazon like. They should have done more testing for bugs before releasing. Hopefully they will fix the bugs soon with a new update."

There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory not the memory card as well as the syncing issues I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.

11979,"Amazon",2016-02-21,2,"Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work every time. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service. Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it. Well I am wrong. My husband has already declared it sucks! . But I do not listen as often and I have more mainstream tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me but no. Here is a short list of why I do not like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible. So much so that even though it is essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything I would rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow difficult to use app. The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version or just plain will not recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud. Plus it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are re recorded versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song. I have not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. what is the deal with this scam?In short if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song good luck if you can find it on Prime Music . But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out or want to listen while doing housework find something else."

Some may say that it is included with prime so why complain? but at this point it is a better option to just pay for shipping normally if you need to and sign up for rhapsody or spotify or save even more and do not use streaming services.it is just unnecessary and costly. Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits but when they decided to attach video again not as good as netflix or hulu and music to it and double the price I cancelled my membership renewal. I would prefer a tier set up where you can elect which services you want but i suspect that would reveal just how overpriced the services are and Amazon would lose too much money to keep them around."

11987,"Amazon",2015-07-17,5,"Excellent musical companion to feed my ears! The Amazon Music app has become my app of choice for accessing the library of music on my phone and also music in my Amazon cloud storage. What I love about this app is it also provides access to TONS of Prime music which is free to those with Prime accounts. I love the stations and playlists. I use them when working out or when I am out for a bike ride. I select a station or playlist and I am on my way. Amazon selects a very nice collection of music to keep me company. The stations gear musical selections around the sensibility of the artist chosen. So the Jimi Hendrix station for example plays artists who are in the same general musical family as Hendrix. Amazon also tosses in a few Hendrix pieces too. There are hundreds possibly thousands of stations and playlists to choose fromMy only criticism relates to getting a feel for how the app works. It took me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music. Be careful of this! If you have saved your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone be sure you have selected Device! If not it will go to the cloud to stream. you will eat up data doing that. I have made this mistake a few times.Very much recommended!"
11990,"Amazon",2015-06-24,5,"LOVE IT! I absolutely LOVE Amazon Prime Music! The choices are endless and 90 percent of the music I am looking for is included in my membership. I downloaded the app on my phone and have replaced my previous streaming music with it! I love how you can have your own library of you favorites but choose a station to listen to when you feel like something different. They have channels to suit any mood and you can set up different playlists from your library. The best part is when you hear a song that is streaming that you like you just hit the plus sign and it adds it to your library and then provides you with alternatives you might like as well."
11991,"Amazon",2014-06-26,1,"The Android App is HORRIBLE. I am on verge of uninstalling. I will also NOT be renewing my Prime Membership. I was really excited at first. As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs. And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley. The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable. It was great before but now is just horrible. I have been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy. It will not load. It crashes frequently. The song pauses every few seconds due to poor slow streaming quality. The app is also an enormous resource hog. It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery. My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all. I love that it remains running when it does not even work.The desktop program is tolerable. It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that. I cannot tolerate the phone app. If things do not improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."
11992,"Amazon",2016-06-28,2,"Who left the back door open? Music part works fine but I do not like the Turn on wifi permission. do not need it do not want it can not see a valid reason for it.

11993,"Amazon",2015-04-05,3,"Nice Enough if it Runs on Your Device I use this app on my Nexus 7 a Google product and it does not allow me to listen to the Amazon Prime Stations. Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC it would not install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular further making it of little use. Works okay on my various PCs where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora Spotify or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations when I can see them!."
11999,"Amazon",2016-02-19,5,"My newest addiction. Love Amazon Prime Music My newest addiction is amazon prime music. I use the app primarily on my phone. I love the pre made playlists. Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I am in the mood for or a band I like and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car in the office and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I have tried Milk music Pandora and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best."
12000,"Amazon",2017-04-04,5,"I used to have another subscription for music. I ... I used to have another subscription for music. I tried Amazon but back then several years ago there was not as much of a selection of my type of music. Now Amazon Music is all I listen too and few of my family members as well! I really have no complaints and literally use this 365 days a year."
12007,"Amazon",2016-11-23,1,"Amazon Music is Terrible It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music. If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole. You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album. Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time. It requires you to do that song by song. Terrible. I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music."
12010,"Amazon",2014-10-18,1,"Horrible performance on Mac Mini NOT usable un install At first was excited to find this app to stream my Amazon music library on my mac. That excitement did not last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you are looking for it displays the album art next to it NOT the one you selected. Beyond that takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I have got a super fast internet connection too so that is not it.Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video prime music but SO HARD to find my own music I own.If performance for this app ever did get fixed it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control. Ever cooler to have an iTunes like visualizer."
12012,"Amazon",2015-08-12,4,"Good service but... I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes but I think maybe I need to use it more. The only reason it is not 5 star is because they do not have a whole lot of new using available to listen to for Prime memebers. Otherwise in an are where I have internet the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good."
12014,"Amazon",2015-08-24,1,"Amazon Fan but this app is useless! This app was never very functional but with the latest update it became unusable. I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon do us all a favor get rid of your broken implementation of and number 34;single sign on and number 34; please!!!"
12016,"Amazon",2017-11-09,2,"Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime this app leaves a bit to be desired. Specifically it is really slow. I have around 3000 songs on my Galaxy S7. It can take upwards of a minute to change screens. Once I have reached the album playlist or artist I am searching for it plays just fine."
12017,"Amazon",2016-07-08,5,"Good User Interface and quickly growing selection. I really like Amazon Music. I have been using it for about 6 months and it is finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It does not have quite the music selection as its competitors but it has enough to keep me happy.At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing but they have been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.Also I am really happy they have been adding more classic Prog Rock like Pink Floyd Jethro Tull Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me Opeth The Mars Volta. can not wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.One thing I would really like to see is a higher bit rate option. I think it'd be a really nice feature although the music does sound pretty decent as is.Also gapless playback if possible. With a lot of prog songs were not designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."
12019,"Amazon",2017-10-05,5,"Amazon Music is another shining example of the rich features afforded the members of Amazon Prime. I was skeptical of this application and just what music I could get as an Amazon Prime member. I was pleasantly surprised at all the well thought out features and the wide selection of music from all genres . I have an MP3 player and I plan to load it with music from my play lists in Amazon Music. For us Baby Boomers we can listen to and enjoy all the legendary mucic of our time."
12020,"Amazon",2016-01-03,5,"Thanks Amazon! What an awesome benefit of being a Prime member! Music creates a time line through our lives. Hearing certain songs take you back to great times so much so that you feel through association that you are there.Getting around the Amazon Music app is very easy and intuitive. If you invest a little time you can create a great playlist of songs that you love. Amazon....Thanks for including this with the Prime membership!"
12022,"Amazon",2015-09-21,4,"Nifty music app. The good:No adsLarge selection overalldoes not cut off the last 15 seconds of music an issue Pandora has never bothered to fixThe bad:Some genres are rather sparse in particular heavy metal and alternativepausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogetherThe search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.In total this has become the music app of choice for me."
12024,"Amazon",2017-05-23,2,"This app is great when it works This app is great when it works. However in the last few months it is constantly freezing after playing only a few songs offline and recently in the last few weeks it will either not launch my library or it will hang up before a song loads to start playing. It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime because it is so unreliable.If this was a free service I would expect some issues occasionally. I expect so much better from Amazon. Maybe Wal Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works."

I bought a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts while I am mowing the lawn.The podcast is already on my phone.I open Amazon music which is supposed to play music on the device and voila it does. It plays through the speaker on the device.I attach the headset and uh no. No audio. I can see it playing I can hear the volume go up and down as it makes a ding each time I adjust the volume.I screw around and waste 20 minutes pairing and unpairing looking at settings nothing fixes it so I toss it on the bed and mow my lawn with nothing but the voices in my head to occupy my time.I come back in and install BlackPlayer. It works flawlessly out of the box.Amazon how how much money to blow on development and you can not stream audio to a bluetooth headset in 2016?Here's some advice. My data will never live in your cloud. Stop designing poor apps thinking it will."

It just removes music that you bought through them the cloud storage is a joke as it is constantly rescanning songs bought and saved to my sd card do not show up or just will not play. The prime music is not a good deal as the songs are just removed with no warning kills whatever Playlist it lives in with it. I play games videos and other Internet intensive apps with no issue. Amazon plays two songs from MY device and still manages to skip and refuse to play. Utter garbage. No customer support either.

I do not know where to even get help or who to email to register a complaint. Grrrrrrrr."

I have a Prime subscription which let us me download and play songs offline but with the latest update every Prime song ie ones you did not buy directly needs to hit the internet or it will not play. This stops your playlists/albums with mixed songs dead or they will not play at all if all Prime. Forget about listening on the subway or anywhere else without an internet connection. Such a garbage move. Yet another example of a change that benefits the vendor and screws the consumer."

But since the last update I can not get into the program without it crashing. Uninstalled reinstalled no change.

If it starts working again I will rerate but I have sent multiple crash reports and no response.Update: redownloaded when I noticed a different build number.

Please restart Amazon Music is the logo and tagline for Amazon Prime Music.We tried to move our home music library to the Amazon Prime Music cloud including the added dollar 25.00 annually for more storage. The concept is great and as our family enjoys Amazon Prime features on the Roku I expected a similar experience with their Prime Music offering. Sadly the Amazon Prime Music customer experience is terrible primarily because of the constant >20 times daily app/system crashes. And when it does run it is SLLOOOOOOOOWWWW. We have tried numerous times to download our library to the Amazon cloud that too has crashed on us several times. We have high speed network access at home but tried also from the office to see if we had a different experience. Nope!When calling in for customer support I was told to set all Streaming Cache and Audio Quality to minimum. Guess what... No change.I expect Amazon will eventually get this all fixed but I would not recommend anyone make the investment and migration yet. For now I would strongly recommend you all stick to Spotify and Apple Music."
12078,"Amazon",2013-12-09,1,"Uh oh...regretting downloading the 3.0.2 update. I used to really like this app however the most recent update 3.0.2 is not good at all. It seems to have removed the lock screen controls which was really the reason I used this app. Looks like I will be migrating over to another music player which is a shame as I am pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem and that is where I was getting most of my music. I am totally regretting downloading this update and am considering looking online to see if anyone has the old version so I can go back. PLEASE AMAZON FIX THIS!UPDATE 12 12 13: There was an update that fixed a few minor issues but still did not bring back the lock screen controls. And now when using the Amazon mp3 app some of my songs cut off half way through for no reason. Really frustrating. I have now migrated over to GoneMAD Music Player. It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old working version of Amazon mp3 but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call. It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless. let us be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service. And I understand that and was OK with it. I will use your store...just give me an app that has some halfway decent features and works and we are good. You had that but now the app is bunk. Just maddening. I will upgrade my rating when the app at least returns the features that were there before the update."
12080,"Amazon",2015-02-19,1,"This app blows. This app blows. It constantly freezes or skips it is always buffering or syncing your Cloud library. If you can get it to play songs you would better not even think about hitting the skip button because you will get stuck buffering and loading and freezing all over again. It works terribly on the Fire Stick doing the same crap as on my phone though the functionality on my phone is way worse. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling and it did not even load all of my music back into the cloud including Prime music I would added to playlists.I had hoped the app would let me listen to the tons of music I have purchased from Amazon and for it to be a friendlier alternative to iTunes which I dislike on principle. It is entirely frustrating when I can not listen smoothly even at home with strong wifi on Amazon's own devices and apps. I hope it gets updated soon because this is unacceptable."

12096,"Amazon",2013-12-26,1,"Once my favorite player now it is junk. I really liked Amazon MP3 up until this latest update. The reason I liked it more than any other player is that if I was in the car or anything else and had the app on screen I could just tap my screen to pause the music. I do not care if my music downloads to my device I can move that to my SD no problem. However now if I want to pause my music while I am driving I have to look at my phone and I do not like doing that. I have switched back to the pre installed player and unless Amazon puts this function back into their app the 1 star rating will remain and I will continue to use the pre installed player while Amazon MP3 stays in uninstalled useless app purgatory."

First allow the app and /or music to be saved to the SD card. When my phone updated to marshmallow it wiped all my music whether this is an Android or Amazon issue idk but everything on my SD card was saved. Second make it easier to download music. I can not afford to burn through my data streaming music. Last again going back to marshmallow update make sure your app is compatible with the newest upgrade. Since marshmallow I can not update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache and data from both Prime and Google Play Store. This means I need to uninstall the app and will loose all my music on my device because I can not save it to my SD card.

Also I used to enjoy being able to swipe my finger from right to left to go to the next song but you have ruined that too by causing a dialog box to come up every time you touch the album art. I have cancelled my yearly cloud subscription and will be looking elsewhere to enjoy my music. you have destroyed a perfectly good app in what appears to be an attempt to make more money.

I want the Amazon app to handle Amazon stuff and leave my stuff alone."
12119,"Amazon",2014-11-18,1,"I hate surfing through sixteen pages of music suggestions to find ... Very difficult to use needs much improvement!First of all every time I go on Amazon to buy MP3s I enter exactly what I am looking for by song and artist. I get several pages of results most of which were not in my search parameter. While I appreciate alternate suggestions I would prefer that they were last and not first. I hate surfing through sixteen pages of music suggestions to find what I am looking for at the best possible price. second some of the sample music is of poor quality sounds like too much treble or like it is in a barrel. Maybe this is just the websites player but I find that the more expensive the song the better it sounds on the sample player. it is funny that the same song on five different albums can sound so different. third now that I have spent an hour surfing for 10 songs I have the nightmare of checking out. Amazon wants to make it so easy to check out or get my money that when I click buy they automatically charge the last debit card I used without my permission or without letting me review the card and charges first. Now I have got a dollar 50.00 service charge from my bank because I did not have the cash on that card it was not the card I wanted to use. You can not change the way Amazon stores you payment information. The only alternative is to go into your account after each transaction and delete your payment method more time consuming. And if you want to call Amazon to complain good luck. They do not have a phone number on the web site and it is unpublished. To make it more confusing when I switch to my account to change my payment method it takes my to Amazon Prime and then I cannot get back to Amazon Music. The icon for my cart amazon music cart is gone. So I click on the my cart icon and it says my cart is empty. I finally figured out that I have to scroll through several tabs to get back to Amazon Music. fourth Now that I have made my purchase and want to simply download my new music it is not so simple. I have to download their app that I do not want to get my music. Once downloaded the app requires a short coarse on how to use it. If you want to download your music to Windows Media Player then not so hard. But if you want to copy it to your device then it is a multi step process. The download app does not ask where I want my music saved nor does it tell me where it saved it. After searching my hard drive I finally found my newly downloaded music but in my download file.Why can not it be simple enter what I want click buy enter my payment method and download that simple."

12164,"Amazon",2014-07-28,3,"Okay app but needs some simple improvements Their latest update makes the app harder to use. I like the app overall it easily lets me play music from my device or my cloud. I really like the Prime Music and you can even download Prime songs. it is fairly easy to navigate and use but I do have some complaints: The app does not rotate with your phone. When I listen to music at work I usually have my phone charging which means the phone is on its side horizontal makes it hard to easily see and scroll through the app when it does not rotate with the orientation of the phone. After the update to this app it is crashed several times on my Galaxy S5 in the middle of a song...do not know why just shuts itself down. On the other hand the app will not quit when I try to shut it down. First off there is no sign out or exit program in the main menu. The only way I can easily find to quit the program is by dropping down my phone's menu of running applications the quick menu and there is a little x to close the Amazon Music app. Only about 10 percent of the time does this x button work. Sometimes it will look like the app closes but when I turn my phone off then back on the app is back on my home screen. The only true way of completely closing this app and stopping it from running on my phone is by going to my phone's application manager and terminating the process for this app that is a completely unacceptable means of closing an app IMHO. there is no option in Settings that prevents the screen from going to sleep. Again when listening to music at work I like to keep my phone on and see what is playing easily skip through songs and choose what I want to listen to. Unless I go to my phone settings and turn off the screen sleep option the phone goes to sleep. So every time I want to change songs I have to wake the phone up unlock it and change songs. The only way you can see the time position of your song and the length of the song is by tapping the screen. The time position and length of each song should be shown all the time or at least give us the option to show it constantly"

The NEXT day my phone was unable to open the pre installed app without getting the following dialog box: Amazon Music app has crashed. I tried to uninstall not able to without jeopardizing other apps. I even tried going into the Amazon App store to download again with same results. Very disappointed if this app will not work on my new phone and also just realized it will not work on my second generation Kindle Fire."

But I am not paying another dollar 100 for my own prime account and having all my digital content segregated from my wife's account."

12182,"Amazon",2017-09-01,1,"Absolutely horrible user interface and Widget is useless I keep hoping that Amazon will get serious about their music offering but at this point I will not be renewing. The only positive thing is the integration with Echo. In Android the interface is not user friendly. it is way too many clicks to get to your playlists and the ui is not intuitive. The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. it is useless and bad never been updated. Other music services have widgets for direct playing of radio stations playlists etc. Amazon please play catch up and take this service seriously. I love Amazon but the music service applications are worthless and incredibly frustrating."
12184,"Amazon",2015-08-25,1,"Clunky unintuitive frustrating I tried using it when it first came out and it was so clunky and unintuitive that I have only been using it as a downloader since and downloading music through this app is an awful experience every single time. It almost always wants me to re download and reinstall the app when I buy digital music and when it reinstalls I often have to restart the app several times for it to recognize that I have purchased music and would please like to download the music. A while ago before amazon forced me into using this app to download their music I used to buy so much more music but now that the experience is so consistently frustrating I wait until there are at least a few items for me to buy and I just stopped impulse buying music altogether. I do like the color orange and think that white text works quite well on an orange background so the app does have that one good thing going for it but that is the only good thing I can think of."

I like having a variety of music and change what I listen to based on what I am feeling at the moment or what I am doing or need to do. Prime music allows me to an almost unlimited choice of music without having to pay for every single song or album. If you like to listen to different music genres and do not want to pay a bunch of money to have it then give Prime music a try."
12203,"Amazon",2016-09-14,3,"Fine if you only get your music from Amazon. This app is solid but it is working overtime to force my loyalty to Amazon. I get it; they are giving me a free app that is their call. But the app struggles to find the MP3s that are already on my phone and the music files I download from Amazon are in a proprietary format that other players can not recognize. Also I have no control over the location of that music. Overall it feels like this app is trying to control my experience in a way that other music players do not. If you really only get your music from Amazon Prime then this is a great option. If you have a large collection of MP3s from multiple sources then this app is more trouble than it is worth."

In the cloud the app still can not find some of my son's and had to go through the process of downloading them one at a time all over again. See where I work they will not allow us access to the cloud so having songs on my S3 is important to have my music on my device. Amazons update has lost 500 songs that I can not play.When I contacted Amazon they said clearcache. When that did not work they said to refresh the cloud. When that did not work they said uninstall and reinstall. Now they want me to call them and troubleshoot the app problem with them.Um excuse me but it id your app that has the problem not me. I do not have time to sit on the phone and troubleshoot your bad app that keeps crashing wants dollar 24.99 a year to store my music when there are others out there that are free"

I have also noticed the sound quality on Amazon music is way better and louder then when I listen in the Apple app. The bottom line: Ditching Apple iTunes like a bad habit switching everything over to Amazon and I may even add a cloud subscription so I can upload all of the stuff I have purchased from iTunes over the year to have it in one place. Please please keep it good and continue adding more music and do not feel the need to copy Apple. Apple let its success got to its head and is on the decline this is a breath of fresh air."

I can not seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I am listening to not a huge loss there. Navigation can be frustrating on a device. The web interface is a bit better. Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites. That would help me a bit. Also how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order. Kinda like a radio. I would love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music. Updated on 11 14 2014The Android app has gotten very good a new phone also helped. I logged into the Windows desktop app last night and SURPRISE!!!! Prime Stations! How about adding that feature to the Android app? I think that would be awesome!"
12218,"Amazon",2017-06-27,4,"Nice app Good if you have prime already. it is a shame you have to pay more to get all the music choices. If I did not have prime I would not pay for it. Too many cheaper options out there but it is a great perk with Prime. It does need search improvement. Sometimes I know certain genres exist but it does not know how to found the right style."
12222,"Amazon",2011-09-15,3,"Frustrating because promising This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone an Atrix. I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers though the tagging and Unknown Artist issues still pose problems and I love the browser interface. However the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality. If it worked as it is supposed to it would be spectacular offering the capability to buy a song from the store then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly. It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up at least while you can stream it over wifi. In practice though it just does not offer the experience it promises. It force closes about 60 percent of the time I try to use it. When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly and usually then force closes. Music playback often skips. This last issue may be android's fault as I have noticed it in other players though never so badly as in the amazon one. However I do not experience the other problems in different music players. Until Amazon fixes these issues this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application. it is an exciting idea and the interface would be excellent if it just worked."
12225,"Amazon",2015-12-08,5,"Best Option for Cross Country Music Had Pandora before but then realized that Amazon Music was included in my Prime membership at no additional charge. Tried out Amazon Music for a week and immediately cancelled my Pandora subscription as I decided I had been wasting my money. Since then I can honestly say that I am completely satisfied with Amazon Music. I recently drove from California to Texas and back streaming Amazon Music the whole way. This was SO much better than either searching for a local station or paying for satellite radio. Mark me as Very Satisfied."
12229,"Amazon",2012-05-10,3,"Keep Working on It Amazon...Please! I really like Amazon's cloud music drive. I have uploaded all of my music to it currently just under 16K songs and I buy all my music from Amazon. So I should really love this app right? No. First off with the amount of music I have I think in terms of genres. I do not think I want to hear artist XYZ today I think I am in the mood for... and pick a genre then pick an album or artist from that genre. The fact that Amazon does not allow me to select music by genre on this app is absolutely baffling. Please Amazon add this feature. it is PAINFUL not to have it.Secondly as someone who changes phones often typically using overseas models and lives in the USA it is hugely frustrating that Amazon is so fiercely geographically fixated on only allowing the right version of this app on your phone then logging you into Amazon.co.uk where none of your music exists. Yes I am an edge case but come on Amazon why do you have to cause me so much frustration? Just let me log into my account and let me play my music."

12233,"Amazon",2017-07-18,1,"and really like the music I have used this app for over a year and really like the music. HOWEVER the last couple months I have been getting warnings about data usage from Verizon. Every time I look for what is using data I find that this app player is open and running. I keep turning it off and it keeps turning the player back on in the background. After removing the app reinstalling it and removing it again I have discovered that it was the reason my battery life is lousy. Something in this app has started to run in the background chew through battery and result in data charges.I used to really like this app and listened regularly for quite some time. it is only the last 2 months that something in this app has been causing an issue. In back to back testing with the app installed then uninstalled not using it at all I went from having roughly 30 percent battery left at 5PM versus 70 percent battery left at 5PM. Reinstalled the app was back to 50 percent battery by noon yesterday then removed the app. Today I have 86 percent battery left at 1:30 PM. The power figures I quoted are WITHOUT EVEN RUNNING THE APP. If I used it I had to recharge my phone before 4PM. The phone was also always warm with the app installed which is a sure sign of power usage.I would say that is pretty definitive. There is something running in the background that cannot be turned off. It was eating my battery and eating my data. It did not do it until the last couple months so they have changed something in the app. that is causing the issue. I removed it from my phone and the phone is back to normal. I will miss it as I used to use it regularly. But I do not like being spied on."
12236,"Amazon",2016-07-10,5,"Great app Cool app despite what others say. Once you play a song fully you done need to download it at all. It will play in your offline music as if it was on your phone. Very useful"

I use this app every night to play my Brown Noise for sleeping and generally whenever I want to listen music through my phone.Using the app is straight forward with a simple layout and standard player controls. You can select to display the music in the Cloud previously downloaded to the device or access the Amazon Store . The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but as other reviewers have noted it does not allow you to select where they are stored i.e. to your SD card. The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I do not have a lot of music files but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"
12242,"Amazon",2014-03-06,1,"Good Cloud Player but.... This is a great way to play your music from the cloud. But if you want to take say 10GB of your favorite music and download it to your SD card so you can listen to it on the train without a data stream....well you can not.let us say your device has 5GB of onboard storage and you have a 64GB SD card. Where do you think this app would create its default download directory? The local device of course. Well just change the default download directory to the SD card and....oh wait a second you can not. They do not permit this. So you buy their music and you can not store it on your SD card. Why do people buy SD cards in the first place? So they can store large files like photos videos and yes MUSIC. Good job Amazon good job!"

I do not see any help icons."

You have to know exactly what you want to listen to. I do not understand why they do not incorporate an intuitive radio player that you can enter several artists into and then rate played songs to have it learn what to play basically just like pandora. If they could do this I would be all in. I will still use prime because there are MANY other benefits and utilization's for it.If an amazon customer service person see's this let me know if there is something like this available because I REALLY want to use it the controls and interface in browser are just very non intuitive much like the rest of amazon's website."
12263,"Amazon",2014-06-29,3,"Decent app subpar widget and notifications As a prime subscriber I was pleased to have this additional service added. I do not enjoy making playlists and I always opt to use premade or instant playlists. Amazon offers playlists that cater to my tastes and which include some songs I like that I do not otherwise have in my library. In that respect I really like what Amazon has brought to the table. That said I do have a few issues with the app. Streaming on my PC is perfectly fine but the streaming playback on my Android phone is always choppy at the beginning of each song. My LTE coverage is perfectly good and Google Play has never had trouble streaming on my phone. My second issue with the app is that it wipes out the active playlist after a few hours of being paused. I want to get out of work and just push play and pick up where I left off. I do not want to have to find that playlist again and figure out where I was. The last issue I have is that the notification tray play button does not work for me. This might have to do with the fact that my playback is always paused via unplugging an auxiliary audio cable but the play button should work regardless. I do not have too much to say about the fullscreen app itself as I only use it to pick my playlist."

Note all my products are brand new so it is the app. Also this app is not setup for roku at this time.

12307,"Amazon",2015-06-02,1,"0 Stars should be an option It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as Free music. I never thought I could dislike a music service more than Pandora... but this takes the poo cake."

On the phone it is no better even playing something takes up to a minute to load the playlist and start playing. Why Amazon why?"

12391,"Amazon",2015-08-06,1,"Amazon apparently does not know when the 80's were. Amazon Prime music has the stations so you can choose which genre of music you want to listen to cool. I like 80's music so i was excited to see an 80's Pop station. I started listening to it being diligent to rate the music I like vs the stuff I do not like then all of a sudden I start hearing artists like Justin Timberlake Avril Lavigne and Jason Mraz. WTF Amazon. Do you guys not know when the 80's were? How hard is it to write code that tells the station if the song was not released between 1980 and 1989 then it is not 80's music....Your stations suck and I am going back to the free Pandora. I would rather listen to a 30 second add than music that does not make sense."

It is easy to make a playlist find a song play a song buy a song or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's. I love it!I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.Somebody had complained that you could not make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud. While this is true you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist. Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist. I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy. I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book. Amazon: PLEASE ADD!! I have purchased yes I paid money another book reader Ambling BookPlayer for this feature alone.

For some reason this app only lets you download music to your internal memory.What does that mean you ask? Well Android users have this awesome feature where you can add memory to your phone using a micro SD card. Usually we add these for apps like Amazon Music because music and video can take up a lot of memory. Especially if you are a music lover. For some reason this app does not allow you to save music to you SD memory just your internal which is usually only 16 gigs or so.If your device has a lot of internal memory then by all means go crazy with this app it is pretty awesome. But if you have not that much internal memory to spare THEN AVOID THIS APP! IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORY LIKE THE KLUMP'S AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT!Until they fix it then I will change my rating."

The only issue I have found is that shuffle will play a song which has already been played in the playlist more than once before it plays all the other songs. I wish that it would make sure to play each song first before playing a song again. I am sure this is something they will fix at some point in the future or at least give you a setting to control it. Otherwise it is a great service!"

12415,"Amazon",2017-01-15,1,"Far better products out there Moving over from Deezer I have been very disappointed by Amazon Music. There is not a lot of choice of music especially for those who prefer niche artists rather than main stream pop. Even though Amazon basically invented the recommendation algorithm its music recommendations fall very short from what Deezer providers. I bought Amazon Prime specifically for deliveries of Amazon purchases and have given Amazon Music a chance. But I have now resubscribed to Deezer."

I never was too pleased with iTunes this is a bit better IMHO.I have about 7 600 songs in my library. I have downloaded about half to my phone. When I try to shuffle that it blows up the app and force closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs. This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application. For example if you are playing a song you can not add it to a playlist from that point."

M only reason for not rating 5 stars is that I have not seen much clean hip hop nor are there a lot of clean hip hop stations.I share a lot of 90's music with my kids and they like it more than a lot of contemporary stuff but I like to do so with radio/clean edits. Cursing is not allowed in our home and although I am sure they hear/see others doing it we have that as a standard in the house.My music collection theory is:Variety YES! cent Foul Language NO!"

In my opinion Amazon has gone from convenience to aggravation. S rolls down hill. No Prime less shopping. I have Netflix so I do not need instant video. Less and less mp3 sales.

However both of us cannot listen to our Prime Music at the same time. This setting is counter intuitive!!! This throttling should be set to two devices at an absolute minimum to support the typical family. We have four kids and do things separately all the time. We do not want to clog up our phones by downloading the songs every time we want to listen to them so we the use of the CLOUD. We also use Amazon for all of our Movie storage via Rokus. The whole idea of having an App and the cloud is to PREVENT this downloading business.

12472,"Amazon",2012-10-04,4,"Very Good But Room For Improvement I am a big fan of this app but it still has some shortcomings that just drive me up the walls:1. Sorting. The Beatles should not be sorted under the letter T. The sorting works fine in the iOS version but for some reason on Android it is a mess.2. When opening the app it should default to Artists not albums. it is logical for people to think oh I feel like listening to artist rather than thinking of an album first. it is one extra click but it is a fairly obvious thing. And this is something that only recently changed it used to work just fine.3. Random songs on my cloud drive just will not appear on the mobile app. Haven't figured out what causes this to happen. Sometimes deleting and re uploading the track works other times the missing song might just randomly reappear. Whatever causes this needs to be resolved.4. User's should be allowed to shut off Upgraded Audio. Great so I rip my MP3's at 256 to 320kbps VBR using the LAME MP3 encoder and Amazon tells me that they are upgrading my audio to 256kpbs? Last I checked 256kbps was of a lower quality than 320kpbs.5. Could use an editable EQ. Currently it has presets you can cycle through but I would like the ability to edit the EQ settings myself."

Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I am usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but...

12500,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update. Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted."

Now onle a few weeks later a large majority of those tracks are no longer available with Prime Music. How frustrating disappointing and unprofessional of Amazon. Actually rather un Amazon like. If there are issues of royalty those should have been settled before any track was released or made available to Prime customers. What am I supposed to do now? Spend more hours to clean up my Library and Playlists?I am usually happy with Amazon and their service but this time I must say I am VERY CAPITAL LETTERS DISAPPOINTED.

There is NO REASON that this app should not allow the user to select where the songs and associated data are stored. NO REASON. I have a 64GB SD card and cannot store any of my Amazon Music on it unless I use root to mount the SD card folder on the internal storage. KitKat allows an app to use an SD card just not read folders created by other apps. Amazon please allow your paying customers to select where they want to store THEIR music.Although it is nice to have the ability to download Prime Music the decision to store the encrypted music in the Amazon Music app data directory Android/data/com.amazon.mp3 not only means that it will be stored in internal storage but will also get backed up by apps like Titanium Backup. If you keep a history of multiple backup files you end up with multiple copies of the same Amazon Prime Music you have downloaded. Since the music is encrypted why not allow the user to select where it is stored?Worst of all if you need to reinstall the Amazon Music app all of the encrypted Prime Music you have downloaded will no longer play and must be deleted and re downloaded. I do not know how the Prime Music encryption key is created but it would be appreciated if there was a way to re authenticate Prime Music already downloaded."

I have had no troubles streaming and fowarding the stream via bluetooth works as well.Mpls. / St. Paul marketSouthern metroHTC Incredible on Verizon 3gThe Good: Solid performance. No gaps in streaming either during or between songs. Clean interface. Easy to navigate. Stream can be forwarded via bluetooth A2DPThe Bad: Spendy I am hoping that the price get's driven down as adoption with cloud computing takes off. it is true you get the first year free but that is just the hook. After that you are looking at a buck a gig per year basically or dollar 20 per year. The pricing is also tiered so that you can not just add 5 gigs as you need them it jumps from 20 to 50 to 100 to 500 and finally 1000 gigs or a Terabyte. I would very much like to see this model disappear and be replaced with an 'on demand' model where I am not forced into paying for storage I am not using.

Updated 7/12/11 This has been fixed External controls Currently there is no external controls when the phone is locked.

I pretty much always play music from my device but I have tried the cloud streaming on my phone and apart from a slight delay in starting to play the song probably due to buffering it works fine. I have both downloaded music from my cloud drive and uploaded it onto both devices and both work great. My one major complaint is that once you create a playlist or add songs to now playing you CANNOT drag and drop the songs to change the order. You have to delete the songs and add them again in the order you want. I usually do not use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to songs in a particular order if they seem to go together well.On my phone the ability to skip songs or pause without having to unlock the screen is pretty nice and I will give them credit that it is innovative.Overall the app has functioned fine and played music fine but not being able to easily change the order of my songs is a huge drawback."

12602,"Amazon",2015-05-05,1,"Purposfully Confusing. The only rational explanation I can find for Prime Music being so ridiculously messed up is that Amazon is trying to confuse their users and have them spend money that they would not otherwise. I could not find a way to see tracks which are included with Prime and stay within Prime. They would insert one or two paid tracks in the search results. The UI is so clumsy and confused I could not make sense of it. I am software engineer and have seen many pieces of software some good some dab and some downright ugly. This one is ugly."

At last count I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them. Maybe I am missing it but I see it if I listen on my laptop but not on my phone."

I know I have the cd at home but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home and kept the driver awake in the process which was great. It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly. Very happy and made me appreciate the service all the much more already love prime for the free 2 day shipping and use it all the time.

I get lots of cryptic error messages. There is no public API. There is no support. Amazon seems to be doing everything it can to hide how buggy their service is. The file tagging and upload interface is at best a proof of concept thrown together by some students... Adobe Air? Really? Most of my album artwork is completely wrong... I have a number of albums whose matched artwork is not only incorrect but offensive. would not it be nice if I could upload my own artwork without uploading all my music again? The problem is that it is slightly better than the other options currently available."

Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F."

Songs are still loaded to my phone's memory instead of the SD card so downloading the stuff directly to my phone is a nightmare. The only way I can listen to my music is to download it from the site on my pc then install it on my memory card and use the player or another one to listen to the songs. I do not know who is behind the development of the app. But if I were Jeff Bezos then I would put it into the hands of someone else. There is no reason that my entire playlist needs to be downloaded every single time I open the app. There is no reason that I should be denied the option of saving to the card instead of the phone."

There is a limitation to the Android operation system that does not allow widgets if it is on your SD card. After doing this I was able to use the widget once again. I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have.

The only problem I encountered is that I downloaded so many songs that I ran out of memory on my phone and had to delete some. They are however still in my library in the cloud.

I read all the reviews complaining about the app size.

You can get caught with a bunch of lousy remakes you bought without knowing. Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they are not close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that is why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: do not bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I did not want. do not know why but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that were not even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all..

I checked my memory card and every place on my phone that I thought I may retrieve it from to no avail. I was very upset to say the least. I spent over dollar 15.00 on those downloads and now I have them no longer and can not retrieve them from the amazon.com web page as there was not save to your computer option when ordering by my phone thru the amazon.com mp3 app. I implore Amazon to correct this issue and at least have a notification worked into the program that will put up a note asking if you are sure that you want to delete this song as it will no longer be available. This is the only fair thing to do anything else leaves the customer to have to re purchase the song download.

My biggest gripe is the lack of control from the lock screen. It takes way too many presses to skip a song especially while driving. I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting but I do not mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing and it works great. That said until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player I will not have much use for it.

It takes a long time about 4 days for me to upload my songs.The app works just fine. It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists. The store portion is easy as well.

I buy all of my music on Amazon and I like how my music is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere. I use the Cloud Player to listen to music on my work computer. I also like that I can choose what to download to my phone. This app desperately needs the ability to change the download location. I have a Droid Razr Maxx and on some newer Android devices sdcard/ refers to internal memory and sdcard ext/ refers to the addon SD card. AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard ext/. I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to but this app has no option to do that. Instead it downloads to the internal memory. Amazon really needs to add the ability to change the download location of the music. This one flaw mars an otherwise great app."

I find myself listening to stations in other parts of the USA. Creating your own personal station is what I like best about this app. so many stations only play what they are dictated to play it is nice to listen to stations where the music is understandable.

It is a great streaming music app. Nice grafics you can add artist that I would not imagine that they would have I like Native American Flute music and I was able to add all of my favorite artist also nice selection in New Age Music.

14415,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-17,5,"I really like this app I really like this app. Not only can I listen to radio stations where I live but I can search other areas and listen to the radio stations from those areas. In addition it is very easy to use!"

The sound is better and I do not have to constantly try to keep the app going like with Pandora. After being on the market for more than 8 years that is just crazy they are still having app problems. I am deleting it and sticking with I heart!"
14418,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-17,3,"Bad Buffering When Looking at Older Posts I like the app as long as I am looking at current pics and videos.

If you wait it may completely freeze or you may get lucky and the video may play."

14429,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-03,5,"Amazing App! I love the sleep music timer on the app. Every night I will set it for an hour and every song I hear stays within the genre of music I like. Also when people think that me listening to the radio is obnoxious I can just listen to stations with my headphones in. This is so much better than Pandora!"
14435,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-07,2,"I do not see the point in a radio app that requires internet when you ca get Prime Music and play with no internet needed I only had this app in for a short time it is hard to figure out. I prefer goingto the Amazon Prime musicstore and getting my music from there. If you get the music from Prime Music you can play it anywhere you go no need for internet ."

14491,"iHeartRadio",2015-10-29,1,"Missing the stations I wanted. It does not have the specific stations I hoped for. NYC 1010Wins news is not there. Also I could not figure out how to get the Mets World series ratio broadcasts."
14492,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-12,5,"Better than Pandora! I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it is better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora when you are first starting out and you want to make your own station you can not just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not it is going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it will give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that is it. Mind you I am not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it is best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
14493,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-26,3,"it is Okay..I Expected Better a lot of hurdles in the set up process. The programming line up appears to be heavily skewed to a very young listening audience. My own tastes are in talk radio opera classical music I prefer Tune In better channel line up for my tastes."
14494,"iHeartRadio",2016-10-18,5,"Better than pandora I wish I could give it 10 stars . No commercials excellent song picks I am in love."
14499,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-14,5,"love I heart radio gotta love an app that lets me listen to my favorite local radio stations no matter where I am. and even better let me listen to stations I find that I like when I am traveling back at home. Facebook is not needed to set up an account I used my email address. or you can listen without registering but I love saving stations."
14502,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-08,5,"love iheartradio I heart radio great app to download . Love the different stations to listen to and your able pick your favorites and make your own music station . Easy to work with and pick and listen to your music. Internet radio keeps you inform when something happens .recommend this app to anybody. Worth the download to try it."
14503,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-21,5,"LOL do not need facebook good app recommended by me you should get it. you do not need facebook OR email just scroll down and press maybe later. you would not be able to access custom stations but who cares!! you can also turn off stuff like explicit language and thats great for young kids. its awesome"
14505,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-27,5,"Great app! iheartradio has changed everything about the way we enjoy music! The app was easy to install and is very user friendly. The format for searching for different stations is set up well. We were able to find the stations we wanted then listen to them without any delay. We even found a County Christmas 'station' that entertained us all afternoon as we put up the decorations."
14511,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-19,1,"Not impressed! could not get it linked up on either of my kindles both fires and one is a HDX. SO I do not believe it was me it is some sort of anomoly with Amazon apps. Not important but it might have been nice to have. Not impressed!"
14512,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-30,5,"OMG! ITZ THE BEST APP IN THE WORLD! I love the app. The music is great and you do not have to listen to just radio stations either. Can listen to a radio for your favorite singer and it will give you more songs that are just like your favorite singer's too. Itz just like Pandora... only better! : "
14517,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-28,5,"Amazing I personally love this app. There a few down sides such as limited skips but there is no limited hours unlike Pandora. You can pick if you want the station to play familiar or unfamiliar songs. You can also listen to live stations without the static. I use iHeartRadio everyday because music is my life."

14542,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-22,5,"I love iHeartRadio! I honestly love this app! I use this app with my email but you do not have to. This app is WAY better than pandora you can create your own station by typing in a song or an artist not an actual station you Dj AND you can listen to real stations that are involved with iHeartRadio . Overall this is a great app!"
14543,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-11,5,"Love at first sound I love this radio station cause it has saywecanfly radio for me and Carson Lueders radio for my sister. It really has music for everyone I really enjoy this app. THANX CREATOR!!!"

14550,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-30,2,"Weak It might play one song of the artist you want to hear on your station. Then 45 min to an hour later another. Even Pandora plays the selected artist more.Possibly the tablet its loaded on but it freezes up more than few times. No freezing up issues with Pandora.Less adds though."
14551,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-13,5,"great app this app is really cool not only that you can listen to radio stations in your area you can listen to stations all across the country. You can also listen to songs by a certain artist if you either have a facebook to do it by email. Download this today"

14566,"iHeartRadio",2014-11-03,4,"good app I have really enjoyed this app. For work I have to drive most of the day and this app comes in handy when I can not find anything good on the local stations. Occasionally have trouble with the app turning off on it is own. Love it otherwise!"

14584,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-18,1,"Great App but. .. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE NEED TO EXPRESS POLITICAL VIEWS. Changed the heart to rainbow to celebrate a supreme court ruling.

Then they created this app and it does not play all the same songs it mixes it up to where you will not get bored. I love the IHeartRadioApp."
14600,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-06,1,"discrimination!!! do not bother getting this app unless you only want to be able to just listen to different stations.

We all heard selections from Swan Lake played over and over just this past Christmas! It was Tchaikovsky. The so called band channels were not exclusive. For instance the Electric Light Orchestra radio channel is not limited to ELO songs. Today I heard Steely Dan Journey and SuperTramp on the ELO channel.

18503,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-26,1,"iheartradio Spy o You have to wonder what really is behind this app. It delivers music of course and advertisements. But why on earth does this need to know where you are within a 5' radius? It can easily determine which ads you should receive and which stations you are allowed to listen to by using COARSE location data. It does not need GPS precision for anything other than to sell that information to whomever is interested in buying it.It runs at startup running constantly in the background tracking your every movement even if you are not listening to it. Why?Plus it gets your list of accounts on your device. All of them. Does Clear Channel need to know about all of your accounts on your Android? If so for what reasons?it is sickening what this app does for no apparent reason other than to sell your personal confidential accounts and location information."

After two weeks I still haven't found anything I like and I do not know how to get past all the pop stations. If I wanted to listen to my 3 local pop stations and the local rock station I would turn on my damn radio. I wanted stations from everywhere I am sorry but the classic rock station in Texas is the same as the station in New Jersey. I feel that this app is for people who are so glued to their phones they can not be bothered to reach over and turn on the radio. Hey if you like it that is fine this app is not for me. On another note I downloaded Tune in radio and that app literally solved every problem I had with iHeartRadio in about 2 seconds."

25244,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-12,3,"Better than... Pandora. At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far repetition. While it is great that it looks for similar genre one would think that with a db of 14M songs you would not hear the same stuff within the first half hour. Overall? it is a keeper for me for now. BIG BONUS No ads every 2 minutes or at all unlike that other app.02 2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I am all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can not find a genre to suit your mood you are just not looking."

25247,"iHeartRadio",2015-04-19,4,"good but not great I love everything about iheartradio but l like to listen to the whole song before I like or dislike the song. iheartradio thinks that people like me do not exist so you can not go back to the song you just listened to and like or dislike it. You have to wait for the song to come up again or pray it does not and never have to hear it again. If you do not like or dislike iheartradio thinks you liked it or something like that but everything else is perfect. I would not change anything else about it if you like music radio or lyrics strung along in a catchy tone this is the app for you."

25269,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-22,3,"NOT THE GREATEST APP Cannot say I am real happy with iheartradio app. It is not easy to use and searching is a pain. The desktop version is terrible.

Love that I found it on amazon so I can now do more multi tasking. happy"
25275,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-21,5,"I love this app! I heart radio is an awesome app. You can listen to live radio as well as create your own stations like Pandora. It features a sleep timer if you like to listen to music before bed and an alarm to wake up to. However if you are like me the music is not enough to wake me up. You do not even have to be in the app to listen to the music. It is also good for finding new stations. It is completely free and it is not required to sign in. If you love music as much as I do you should get this app."

25364,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-06,2,"More like iHeartBuffering My favorite radio station out of Dallas went to this app so I downloaded it to listen. Constantly buffers. Hiccups in audio all the time. Very unhappy as I used to listen to the station on the TuneIn app with no problem. Hopefully ClearChannel gets their servers situated or they are going to lose lots of listeners to other formats."

I know it is hard to choose so here's a small summery. iheartradio has many stations based on genre where you want to hear it from and you can create your own stations with commercial free included and Pandora has all that but you have to pay dollar 5.00 and skips too. Now you decide."
25386,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-03,4,"best music app ever I love this app you can listen to free music and the music does not take up any space!

25638,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,4,"Four Stars: Please read information below Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there is no adds so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it will automatically choose songs or stations to play next. it will also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app when you bring the menu up or down you can not like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can not save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist. This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you do not like it remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that is the truth. I am here for the same thing as you to maybe see if its worth it to create a review or to expose. But here...there is nothing really to expose."
25640,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-06,4,"Must Read !!! Excellent app to listen to so many different types fromcomedy to rock and anything in between.Excellent app and I recommend it to all.This will be excellent until there is a charge to use it.I would suggest to all that if and when you have to pay forthis... call or write and complain.Right now remains an excellent that all should have.Rich"

25654,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app! I love so many features about this app. The custom radio stations one can build are excellent. Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs. You can touch a button if a song plays that you do not like and it will deleted from the playlist. Like the song? Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format. As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app. I have not had that problem. I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen. Just pick one and enjoy. This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.

25706,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-29,4,"Great app with one exception Wonderful station with one exception that I will get to in a bit.Lots of stations from my local area stations to decade specific genre stations. I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore. Very few ads really just occasionally when I change stations. Limited number of skips available per day but meh just change the station if you really can not stand that song.Now for the reason I did not give it 5 stars. This is an older version 5. The newer version 7 allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated. This version is buggy or it just does not work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire. The version 7 app from Google Play loads fine on my tablet and smartphone for that station just not this version for Kindle Fire."

Has streaming problems This iheartradio app is amazing has most of the station's on the air I enjoy has other radios and settings and just like Pandora as you can choose any genre or artist or create you are own station. The only problem that I had is the streaming is sometimes temporarily off but other than that I heart iheartradio!!!!!"
25757,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-22,5,"Super Solid Internet Radio App Clear Cut Privacy Policy What a honest neat app! First a quick treatment concerning the permissions. I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy and everything is upfront and optable. ClearChannel only shares information with third Parties in two cases: a delegation directly involved in providing app services b when the user voluntary opt ins for marketing none of that you automatically agreed to get marketed guff. When I initially looked at the social circle registration I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications. The email address registration is the most private method of registration. All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in app adverts; however they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing. These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you X out of them. Otherwise for a freebie radio with custom channels this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad confusing advertising riddled interfaces. iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI. I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what but in about 6 minutes I had my custom Beatles channel made and audio commercial free streaming. Sweet! I especially love the mix selector. Double Sweet! On top of everything a moderately low RAM footprint approx 46mbs during streaming less than my Chrome Browser. This app gets 5 solid stars and a Woot! Addendum: As of 20Jun14 apparently a recent update has done away with the intermittent static adverts and replaced them with a single streaming advert at the beginning in this case a T Mobile commercial. can not exit out of it but it is rather short and bearable for a free radio service.

I have Sirius/XM and love it and I have the app and that is great but wanted to get a local station and downloaded iheartradio to see if they had it they do not but I found a plethora of other channels that I loved mostly comedy. Like Larry the Cable Guy and John Pinette and Jim Gaffigan and Lewis Black you get the idea. There are only a few from each performer than a bunch of others like Ralphie May and Gabrielle Eglesis. I believe they are come on's to buy the albums but still there is a lot of content here. And tons of music. I run it on my Kindle Fire HD and think it is great. When I was a kid we had transistor radios and huge record players this stuff is amazing compared to that."
25769,"iHeartRadio",2016-06-23,5,"My favorite music app I like it better than most other radio apps and it is easier to turn off push notifications with this one and the commercials are far less with this than some competitors.

I am very happy with this app!"
25777,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-29,4,"Better than local; will never equal the past. It is 100 percent better than any radio station out there today; that being said it does not come close to the stations and the independent format of decades ago. How many remember the King Biscuit Flower Hour ? There are literately millions of albums and singles out there which are never played; although not a top 40 format they do repeat the same song within a few hours. I remember well the great independent format of the late 60's and early 70's WQSR 102.5 Sarasota FL; its call letters were Quad 102 1/2 in today's market everything pre recorded on a disk I doubt if ever we will see or I should say hear real music format again."

My home town Talk Radio station out of the blue dropped the Sean Hannity radio program from their line up. My calls to their office go unanswered. It made me question their motives. So I looked on the internet and found iheartradio. I am 60 years old and this app is very user friendly I have no trouble with it. I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio in New York City of all places I live in WA State I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle or my computer and even on my Windows phone.

I have this app on my 2012 Nexus 7 currently running Android Lollipop 5.1.1 a BLU Win JR running Windows Phone 8.1 a HP laptop Windows 8.1 and now on my new Fire HD 7.I noticed that this app is a bit slower to load while streaming and possibly prone to skipping I usually have it running in the background/screen off so not sure but I did run this app on both the Nexus and Fire side by side on one of those Perfect For radio stations and noticed that the one on Android loaded new content a bit quicker but I think that is because the Fire takes the time to remove any buy here links that are not Amazons. My guess is that there is a bit of code that looks at the next song on the playlist and if it is not available at Amazon then that song will get automatically skipped."

25823,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-12,5,"Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio feature after seeing them featured online through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area. Anyhow as in Pandora iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as I am listening to their music. I have over 30 music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance the do not stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna pet shop boys deppeche mode tiesto armin van buuren calvin harris 2am ambient pitbull dancin 90s Britney spears adam lambert euro dance Darren hayes foofighters the 90s unglued one republic lasgo Swedish house mafia ellie Goulding Fergie robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."
25824,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,3,"it is okay as long as you like the programming If you enjoy listening to your local Clear Channel radio stations you will probably like this app. You also gain access to numerous other Clear Channel radio stations around the country with various programming formats and genres. The limitation is that this is pretty mediocre programming. I am not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music being programmed. No matter what the genre corporate radio manages to play music that all sounds the same. Since radio plays homogenized sounds recording companies record music that all sounds the same. Pretty boring stuff.To be fair I have not sampled every single radio station offered on this app. I am familiar with the local stations typical of the music described above and what other stations I have sampled seem to have the same programming. So if you like this type of music you will enjoy this app."

I really like this app but it does need a couple improvements.ones that other devices get Since I have had it I have gotten emails on 3 occasions from IHeartRadio stating there are new updates fixes etc. But the app for Kindle has not had an update since July 2015. They are completely ignoring there Kindle customers."

25835,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-10,4,"love it! I love being able to listen to all the local radio stations on this app that is the one thing pandora does not have. My only complaint would be that if you turn off the explicit content it would not let you on any stations after that to listen to music you would have to turn it on again. That really bothered me. Though it may have radio stations pandora does not have that problem."
25839,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-17,5,"it is awesome! it is so refreshing to be able to listen to my local favorites on my Kindle instead of being pidgeon holed into listening to cable radio that has re destined formats. I get my local DJ's and my favorite local programming."
25842,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-22,5,"Best Radio app by far I love this app! I have told my friends and family...even strangers how Great it is. My husband our kids and some of their friends have installed it and it has ran Rly good even on their Apple iPhones. Pandora plays too many ads not enough music. I hardly hear ads on iheartradio. ONLY my brother had yet to get it but that is due to iheartradio not having 93.3 The Planet Greenville SC. The next best is AccuRadio which I have on my Kobo Vox ereader since this app will not install. I am sure if iheartradio would add 93.3 they would get more consumers. A LOT of people love The Rise Guys."
25843,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-17,1,"Sucks It does not play 'like music' nor have a good amount of new or unknown music even when you tell it to. it is pretty bad. It doen't stick to the genre you selected. SURE Pandora will sneak in Bob Marley into every station but when I am listening to Brand New ans Justin Timberlake comes up and makes you say WHOA wat a minute what the hell just happened did my station just switch on me? Oh no it is just iHeartRadio sucking as usual. I had to use this app while living in Costa Rica because Pandora was not available. It was depressing. Use Pandora. unless you are like my mom she would love iHeartRadio. If you are someone who just likes to listen to whatever is trendy in the pop culture genres this is for you."
25844,"iHeartRadio",2016-08-19,4,"Pretty Awesome Juat a Few Adjustments I love this app. Free music and great suggestions for new music based on your preferences.

Can change it in a fraction of a second like my moods. Only problem lately I keep getting asked to rate it at least once a song sometimes twice.

I have actually started a whole new collection of CDs from works I have heard here first!"
25857,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-13,5,"Very torn on this rating.... I loved the way my son has been able to use this on his iphone so that is why I wanted it on my tablet but it has not been as great for me. When I tried to open it I had to answer a bunch of questions and it forced a sign in either through my Facebook or email. I was going to choose Facebook but then found this is yet another app that wants permission to pretend to be me and I will NEVER permit any app to do that. So back to the sign in. It proceeded smoothly with the email option but once I got in it basically took over my tablet. I could not use anything else and I HEART RADIO basically froze on my screen. I had to completely reboot to turn it off. Doubt I will use it again on my tablet which is a pity. I do like the product though. My son has it on his iphone which plugs into his car system by USB and I love the created station option which lets us pick a genre and hear the kind of music we prefer without ads and chat. it is great for road trips."

Thanks for making something as unique and a awesome app that has every single type of music it has a variety of different elements that make it better than Pandora.Thanks again Ryan D. DuffyP.S. I need to add that the Amazon Customer Service Reps answering the phones anytime day or NIGHT! Are so professional personable and fast. Every time I have had an issue with my Kindle Amazon has called me immediately and done everything they could to not only fix the problem but they show you thing's you may not of known about your Kindle and how to maneuver the apps and programs to make it suit your every day needs. they have never got impatient sarcastic or acted like someone needing help is a waste of their time. They are genuine and I can not say enough good things about my experiences. I myself am in the Customer Service industry and when someone treats me like there talking to a friend not a customer I want to continue to use and purchase whatever I may need from them and tell all my friends family or business how great and easy Amazon is.

I live and work in an area where the radio stations are few and they talk a lot.I work in a metal building and the radio stations are very finicky about coming in and hanging thru the day.I was using Pandora and I did not mind them having an occasional commercial but it totally locks up on commercials and I lose my music. Very annoying. I am constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial. So I downloaded iheartradio. it is great. It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle but so far it was well worth it and it did not cost anything to download the app thru Amazon. You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account but it works great. I recommend it. I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."

It annoys me so much I can not stand it. I have several customized stations and the thing is if there is a song I do not like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist I can not. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall a decent app. The sound quality is good there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations and it is easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."
25963,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-04,4,"Local station for The Big Show I do not like the hard rock played on the local iheartradio station or any station for that matter. But the local Columbus Georgia and surrounding Alabama..station 103 102.9 runs the John Boy and Billy. Big Show 6 days a week from 6am to 10 am EST. And I faithfully listen to the show. I can get it on my Android phone and iPad as well! So I rate a four star to iheartradio for having the programming flexibility for airing the Big Show. Other people I know say the same and that iheartradio should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for 20 hours and all day Sunday when the Big Show is not broadcast!"

25966,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-02,5,"I love iheartradio winking I LOVE iheartradio!! It is a great app with great music! I love that you can stream live radio from the app especially because this way I can listen to my favorite radio stations wherever I am regardless of whether there is a tower nearby. My ONLY complaint and it is little is that when you are making a custom station you can not add more than one band or artist to add more variety. But I also have Pandora which does do that so it is not a big deal. Overall I highly recommend this app!!"
25969,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-26,2,"Selction of live radio channels is disappointing Very limited selection of live channels. I am unable to select the radio channels I listen to such as my local PBS channels. The classic rock statin I listen to also can not be selected. I wanted to use iheartradio on my TV in my living room because the radio reception especially for AM radio in my area is really terrible. I was also not able to find certain talk show hosts on iheartradio either. Very disappointing."

Started getting a white screen that rapidly turned to an unending black screen. This will not work unless I used with the first loaded station at least I remembered where the pause button was. It was a nice alarm clock replacement until I received my new owner from Amazon today at least. Removed today because I was not able to delete the alarm I set.

26014,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-28,2,"Not Impressed The way this was described it sounded like it would be a great way to listen to music I like. I created my own channel according to directions choosing an artist I liked. Well they play LOTS of that one artist but not much of anyone else. They do not even offer many artists to even vote up or down. like or do not llke Since the artist I initially chose was male they give me very few female artists to choose from. only 2 so far Now my station has about 20 songs that are played over and over. Tired of it after just a couple days."

My new fire came in and I noticed sounds in apps that had never been there before so I figured the first fire was defective. I downloaded this app again on Thanksgiving morning and immediately started having sound issues again on the fire not only in this app but in others. I have deleted the app off the new kindle reinstalled other apps that started having sound issues and things seems to be back to being fine again on the new fire. My sister says she occasionally has issues with this app on her phone so until Amazon gets to the root of my sound issue problem again I will not be using the app anymore.As for the app performance itself eh it is all right. I would rather just use vevo or something and hear the song I really wanted to hear not just hope that it will magically appear."

Then I will switch over to one of My Stations after work to hear Disturbed or Pantera.I love the Sleep Timer feature too and use that when I travel and have a tough time falling asleep. Falling asleep to music just works!My only gripe ... I really like the Thumbs Up/Down feature for songs. However I do not think the DJs are actually paying attention because I hear the songs I do not like every single day. There are millions of songs out there... we can hear more than Madonna and Adele every once in a while."

I still have it stuck in my head...haw haw hugh planet fitness intimidation. Makes me so ugh. My phone seems to drop them a lot to and every time I started it again there is the fitness add again. FYI there is much better options radio websites have links for there station. Just bookmark them in your browser. You can also play playlists from YouTube and even make playlists on your computer you can play anywhere.

I knew my cousin's son was a DJ but did not know him that well. But through this I am able to hear a morning radio show he produces in Raleigh N.C.!! We are not allowed to promote but if you enjoy conservative talk radio check this out. Also good for making your very own radio show with the type of music and artists you love. I enjoy it very much."
26103,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-28,1,"iheartradio Too Hard to Use it is a good concept but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites. Also I got stations on there from places like Baltimore Boston Miami what the? I live in western Colorado what do I care about the east? I was hitting the choices to see what would happen. Once I got a station on favorites always by mistake it was futile to remove it from the list. Know what? I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips what do I need this for?! Just more headaches. The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who do not sit hitting buttons all day long. Lastly there did not appear to be enough stations I liked i.e. liberal talk radio and traditional country music. I am not a Glenn Beck fan nor do I listen to hip hop pop and all the other 20 something stuff out there these days. We Boomers are not dead yet people! Provide something for our age group or lose business. Thank you."

26317,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-26,2,"can not get iheartradio to work on my tablet. I could not get it to work on my tablet. Never having used anything similar I did not know what to expect but thought it would be an easier process. just click and listen. I basically wanted to listen to internet radio and it would not come thru. It supposedly downloaded but it kept asking me to download it each time. I finally gave up. do not know if it would work with music but probably not.My amazon shop.com almost never comes up on my tablet the way it should. I have to keep going back to the settings menu clear data and retry and then it is still iffy .I will try it again at some point."
26327,"iHeartRadio",2016-05-25,5,"IHeartRadio I purchased this so that I could get this program on my tablet and phone. The down load went quick and I was able to view both on the table and phone that I have. I would recommend this product."
26328,"iHeartRadio",2017-03-04,5,"Amazing Get this app it is amazing"
26331,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-27,5,"Good app! This is the first music/radio app I have ever downloaded and it is simple to use. Every once in a while there is a pause but it more than likely could be a wireless connection. it is never paused for more than a minute or so and it is not often enough for me to give it less than 5 stars. There are so many music apps out there but I am satisfied with this one until there is reason not to be."
26334,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-22,5,"Love this app. I love this app. Unlike other music apps I have tried this one does not stop. It does not interrupt the music with a screen asking if I am still in the room. That is so annoying. I also love the variety of music chosen for my stations."
26335,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-05,1,"Would not play desired station and no response for help from the developer. Waste of download time. I was really excited about this app and I wanted to love it but my experience just is not good. I downloaded the app because it was supposed to broadcast one specific station that I really wanted. The station advertised that it is available on this app and the app itself also advertised the station. However after downloading I clicked on the station to play it and my phone just sat silent. I tried playing other stations all of which seemed to work fine. But the one station that I wanted and the only reason I downloaded the app did not work. My husband had the app on his phone which is a completely different model and OS and the result was the same. The app just would not play the desired station. I would have written the experience off with a few more stars because other stations did work. However I contacted iHeartRadio via their reporting service and described my issue. I never heard back from them. As a result I give three stars for the app not working as advertised and I lowered that to just one star because of the lack of response by the developer."

While I used Facebook to register it does support an email alternative. I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can not receive locally. The app installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.Recommended!CFH"

I prefer Pandora please check out and like my review on that happy"

26435,"iHeartRadio",2014-08-22,5,"Just what I need! As a 14 year old this app is just music...to some people. For Me it is a music app for an alarm clock for school or just chilling with friends....it is definitely worth the process of getting apps in the Appstore. I would recommend this app out of Pandora or Slacker. It seems the most user friendly. And it is great for school or something else. If you do not want to waste more of your battery than put a sleep timer on! ITS just one to get so I highly recommend this app for you! happy"

Done everything tech support has told me to do even tried uninstalling. If this is supposed to be the best radio app ever it sucks. I am very VERY disappointed!!

I read the reviews to see what everyone else was saying first though. I did not realize you had thlo log into facebook. Sure I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio but it shows what you are listening to. I am not going to download it because I do not want my friends to know what I am listening to. If you want my opinion just get Pandora. it is free and all you need is an email."

26991,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,1,"WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds find the signal and then drop it again hen repeat the process. Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps.. With I Heart Radio I can be sitting two feet from a wifi feed and it still drops the station and can not find it. Same issue if I am not near a wifi and using cellular signal. It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating. I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all. If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch. It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to. An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

27691,"Pandora",2013-12-09,5,"Pandora on Kindle is a great combination. Pandora has become my go to place to experience new music. I am still old school enough to find an artist I like and then buy the CD soon I will be buying the vinyl. The Pandora app runs great on my Kindle Fire so now I find myself doing more music research when laying in bed before I turn the lights out for the night."
27692,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"I love it Although I basicly stay on one channel it is awesome they always play the best songs"

It is very easy to use easy to pick your own type of music and easy to say 'I do not like that' when something is introduced that grates on my nerves."
27695,"Pandora",2017-01-07,4,"Four Stars I guess after you get good with it it may be good. Until then it is quite difficult."
27699,"Pandora",2014-01-28,5,"Freedom to listen to the songs you really love I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down. Also I can listen to Pandora while I play games on my Kindle fire. Thanks to my grandson for telling me about Pandora as he also uses it and he showed me how to use it. Love it."
27704,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"Broken app no longer! Thank you for fixing. We are going back to 5 stars. PANDORA!!! Have you even noticed the comments since your last update? Hope you are working on a fix. Thanks for bringing me music before that."
27716,"Pandora",2017-05-23,1,"Pandora will not allow me to get in. Says unable to play music ALL the time. Vary disappointed."
27717,"Pandora",2015-11-20,5,"Good stuff I live this .. I do not listen to the radio very much but this is wonderful to have. I can determine what will be my regular songs and what will be the songs I do not want to hear"

27720,"Pandora",2016-09-13,5,"All you need. Almost anything you want. Even ...Mother's of Invention...best part.. No messing around start it it plays"
27723,"Pandora",2015-08-03,3,"Too many ads Good music like being able to select favorites and skip songs but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
27729,"Pandora",2017-05-04,5,"Five Stars excellent music. use a lot."
27735,"Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"Replaces XM radio This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."
27745,"Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"Pandora is terrific I like the idea of selecting my own music. It is free. If I like an album I can buy it on Pandora. The variety is outstanding."
27746,"Pandora",2017-11-02,5,"it is so cool it is easyer then going to youtube when you are in a rush I love it you should try it so time all it need in a phone and it is easy like 123"

27758,"Pandora",2015-11-25,5,"Awesome! Pandora is awesome and you can put it on any device that you own. It is the 'boombox' of 2015. Love it and it brings the past music era's into the here and now. Love it!"
27760,"Pandora",2015-06-08,5,"Great app I love Pandora.. The fact that I can choose what I want to listen to and subscribe for commercial free music for such a cheap price is awesome... Satellite radio is expensive and you do not get to choose anything"
27761,"Pandora",2016-01-24,5,"Awesome app This app is completely useful instead of having to go on YouTube and searching for your favorite song I guarantee your favorite song will come on with Pandora"
27762,"Pandora",2013-11-07,5,"Can listen to my favorite songs! Love it because I just type in an artist I like and it somehow knows what other artist I like and I can listen to it without many ads at all. I can shuffle my stations and listen to all the music genres I like together . The only thing I do not like is it plays too many live versions of songs and I would rather hear the studio version."
27763,"Pandora",2014-07-07,5,"on all my devices and Roku too! Love my Pandora radio! I have several radio stations I have created that did t my changing desires in music. The ads are short provide a little break and I do not mind them nothing like commercial radio and announcers constant blabbering just constant music with brief interludes."

27774,"Pandora",2016-02-14,1,"Not worth it could not get the app to play on my kindle"
27775,"Pandora",2013-08-04,5,"Music your way It deserves a 5 star rating because there is nothing out there like it. could there be some improvements now that i have experienced for years now yes. but they are very small. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of hearing the insulting to your intelligence commercials and are tired of hearing the same 10 songs played over and over again."
27776,"Pandora",2016-09-02,5,"Five Stars it is free and plays great music tailored to the person's preference it does not get any better than that."
27777,"Pandora",2013-03-13,5,"Music For Whatever Mood You Are In I love Pandora. I have found stations that I probably would not look for otherwise and genres that compliment the mood I am in. I also like the shuffle feature when I am not sure what I want to listen to knowing it will be something that I like. This is one of the first apps I added. Knew I had to have this one!"
27780,"Pandora",2016-05-12,5,"Love it. They have so many different genre's of ... Love it. They have so many different genre's of Music and you can also make your own list. I have had it for a long time on my phone"

27791,"Pandora",2013-03-01,5,"Great! This is a great app for the tablet and phone. It is by far the best way to stream music."
27792,"Pandora",2016-06-17,5,"Great music app! Pandora is great. It offers a wide variety of music! I love how I can mix my favorite music together and set it to shuffle."
27793,"Pandora",2013-02-05,5,"Fits my Moods Pandora is great because I can choose the type of music I am listening to according to my mood for the day. When I am studying I can listen to smooth jazz when I need inspiration I can listen to Rich Mullins when I am feeling mellow I can listen to James Taylor when i need a lift I can listen to Big Band or Beach Boys. The songs are varied and fit the genre I choose."
27794,"Pandora",2017-07-13,5,"nice app !!!!!!!! love it !!!"

27811,"Pandora",2016-12-26,5,"Five Stars Best music options ever....Love it...and you can not beat the price.....!!!!....."
27814,"Pandora",2016-08-10,3,"Good but has a mind of it is own. I love that I can find the stations I am in the mood for. it is easy to use. The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone and sometimes it kicks on by itself. It does not matter if I am at work or school or in the middle of the night. I will not be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone when Pandora comes on it is loud! If that were fixed so it would not randomly start playing I would give it 5 stars."
27817,"Pandora",2016-06-04,5,"Great app I have Pandora on my phone and love it thought I would get it for my k I will idle fire since amazon music is not easy to use."

27840,"Pandora",2017-03-16,5,"Love"
27843,"Pandora",2016-02-03,4,"Upgrade if possible If you are able to afford Pandora One it is worth it! Regular Pandora is frustrating to listen to with all the commercial interruptions..just my opinion"
27844,"Pandora",2017-02-19,5,"cool great"
27845,"Pandora",2014-02-26,4,"Free Music! I enjoy having a diverse selection of artists and musicians at my fingertips! it is also an added bonus that you get to know new artists as well. If you love music you will love Pandora. They do repeat songs and the ads are annoying but it is the price you pay for free you can always upgrade to Pandora One."
27847,"Pandora",2013-07-24,5,"Great music I use pandora in the car on my phone on my Kindle while reading on my PC while while writing as well as through my TV when I am not watching a program. I especially like the fact that I can select a group of entertainers and shuffle the music so I get a variety of styles and performers. Only rarely do I feel the need to skip a particular song."
27849,"Pandora",2015-05-19,5,"LOVE THE MUSIC Great selection of genre and songs. I like the feature of mixing songs within all my genre."
27856,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Pandora radio free! Super! Now I have a radio on my Kindle Fire HD. Pandora is a plethora of music choices.

27870,"Pandora",2013-12-11,4,"A must have app! I love Pandora and this is a very nice app. It allows you to access all of your channels and explore music intuitively. The only thing that I was not terribly fond of was the interface for creating new channels and finding music outside of your already defined channels. Otherwise it is a great app and very functional."
27871,"Pandora",2016-12-13,2,"has gone downhill recently I have begun playing cd's once more pandora is now worse than am radio"
27873,"Pandora",2012-06-08,5,"Awesome App! Exceeded expectation! Flawless install. Able to get any music channel taste. Brought back memories especially do wop! No negatives! Get it!"

27887,"Pandora",2013-07-01,5,"Great Website! I have used this website on my PC and Phone and now on my Kindle. I am now a Pandora One member. I love that it plays my favorite music and I can listen anywhere. Thank you Pandora !! I also found out that you can thumbs up or thumbs down a song and Pandora will learn what you like. How innovative. I listen to it on my Kindle and on my smart phone."
27888,"Pandora",2015-03-16,3,"Music is good but often wont stream after commercials for several minutes it is ok. Music is good but often wont stream after commercials for several minutes. Also some of the channels will play a genre of music unrelated to what you are listening to. But I haven't found anything I like better...."
27890,"Pandora",2014-05-09,3,"Not as useful as I would hoped it would be This app is fast easy to use and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I am out I am more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I am at home I am more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it is easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally my Kindle relies on wifi so when I am out if I have no wifi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me personally this app does not get much use on the Kindle."
27891,"Pandora",2015-08-29,5,"great music app Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before."
27892,"Pandora",2015-08-20,2,"How annoying. I used to love this More and more commercials. Put on ambient music for my infant and the commercial came on and startled him because of how abruptly loud it was. How annoying. I used to love this application"
27895,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"Pandora alows yo to hearb YOUR music! Great way to get a great mix of your music anywhere!"
27896,"Pandora",2013-12-14,4,"yes Love the new way you set it up Pandora.

And Pandora you have picked the best songs for my stations!The Music Listener Lillypop"

27905,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music I am a first time user of Pandora. I find it very user friendly. I like where your pick and it plays similar artists music."
27912,"Pandora",2013-10-31,4,"Pandora Review free version Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they are getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2 3 songs but hey it is free so I can not dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it would not hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One paid version but the thought has crossed my mind since it is only a measly dollar 3 per month dollar 36/year. This version eliminates all commercials.Pros: free offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons: commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station you hear the same tracks if you are a daily listener rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you are listening to then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that is all you want to hear but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the dollar 3 if there was a guarantee for better variety but until then I am satisfied with the free version and who knows maybe that is why I am shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."
27917,"Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"GET IT NOW!!!!! I listen to Pandora more than other music programs I have It is user friendly and works very well. I would recommend it to everyone!!!"

I would recommend spotify because you can litsen to music you actually search for and Pandora when I search for a song the real song does not come on it is a completely different song then what I search for therfor GET SPOTIFY"

27983,"Pandora",2014-06-19,3,"disappointed I created a channel I titled Eagles Radio feeling like listening to some mellow classic rock one day. I have yet to have them play a single Eagles tune since I told them what I prefer. They DO play a lot of B sides by groups I was not all that fond of."

28118,"Pandora",2015-07-09,5,"Pandora One is an excellent source of high quality music Pandora One is an excellent source of high quality music. The only drawback is the 100 station cap and for some of us audiophiles that is just a very slight inconvenience very slight..."
28121,"Pandora",2013-07-27,5,"great music whatever your mood is Easy to set up a station by genre with the option to skip a song if it is is not what you expected. Or pick an artist and Pandora will find all the albums and shuffle them for you. it is a bit like i tunes on an i pad... but much more powerful.

28145,"Pandora",2015-08-08,4,"Pandora is awesome but has one flaw Pandora is a great app because of it playing a variety of songs relating to the artist genre or song you write. But sometimes I just want to only hear all of one artists songs."

28354,"Pandora",2014-03-24,3,"app works well The app's function is fine. I have always loved Pandora but it seems like over the last year or so there are more commercials than music. Also be careful of what songs you like the programs will start to meld together regardless what channel or artist station you are on."
28358,"Pandora",2013-02-08,4,"Could use one more thing.. This app is excellent on the kindle fire works just like the website. My one complaint is that to skip or pause songs you have to return to the app possibly losing your place is you are doing something else. I would give this 5 stars if I could skip/pause right from the notifications tab in the top left. This would make the app much more sleek."
28363,"Pandora",2015-09-06,2,"... thought this would let me listen to actual my favorite radio stations I mistakenly thought this would let me listen to actual my favorite radio stations. I listen to Christian radio stations for the talk shows more than the music."

This app worked great I did not have a problem with it at all . it is like a radio only you can skip the song if you do not like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. it is like Pandora on a regular computer only it is portable. Again love this app ."

28403,"Pandora",2013-06-07,4,"Best music app Pandora is the best music app out there. Easy to understand and plays great songs. The one bad part is they limit your free listening to 40 hours a month. After that you either pay .99 for the rest of the add supported month or buy the non add supported unlimited listening. I listen at work all day so my time is up in a week."

Plays in the background while I am working other apps and is way better then Spotify. I had Spotify for a week and I hated it. Only drawback it that it drains battery power pretty fast. but I guess that is to be expected."

Time goes by so much quicker when you have music you enjoy listening to. I get to decide if today will be pop soft rock or country or just music similar to some of my favorites. I really enjoy picking the all 80's or all 90's stations and easing through my day with great music. Pandora is SUPER and I am glad it is out there for me to enjoy. And I am just now learning how extensive this media is and I look forward to hearing it ALL!"

28432,"Pandora",2013-12-21,5,"Never thought it would be this good! I have been an occasional listener to Pandora. I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is dollar 36 a year! I signed up noticed the advertising gone but more since I had put some cash on the line I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station.

28997,"Pandora",2013-03-15,4,"Great Radio app I use Pandora on a few of my devices. I really like to use it when we have functions. The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area.I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason."
28999,"Pandora",2015-10-13,5,"Love the accessibility of so many of my favorite artists Love the accessibility of so many of my favorite artists ! And to be introduced to some of their not so chart busting songs also ."
29000,"Pandora",2013-01-17,5,"Oldies but Goodies enjoy completely listing to all the songs that I have chosen and the ease with which I am able to find and select my choices."
29003,"Pandora",2016-07-19,5,"Pandora is user friendly I have been using Pandora for 7 months. I have tried others but the reason I like Pandora so much is my ability to tell it what kind of music I want to listen to....Some may say another internet radio station does that....well if they do they are user friendly enough for me to figure it out."
29005,"Pandora",2014-01-18,2,"After the love has gone.... When you first meet Pandora you get a light headed feeling. You think to yourself Wow finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of. You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact. You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you would get introduced to. You mess around with different combinations of songs artists themes etc until you realize something strange is happening! You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true? Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop where all the music you clicked like to is constantly being played even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on? You start to panic and say Well maybe the free version has limitations. So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together. You take the plunge pull out your credit card and go for broke only to be deflated dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self pity and regret. Why? Why Pandora Why?"
29011,"Pandora",2014-12-19,4,"The best radio app out there! This is the best radio app ever! Great music you can mix and match songs. The only thing is that it does not have the latest songs a lot of the songs are the older ones but still very good!!!"
29020,"Pandora",2015-05-31,5,"LOVE IT! Oh I am so happy with this service. I can create my own channels and use my phone to listen in the car. I thinkit is as good or better than the paid services."
29022,"Pandora",2014-12-07,1,"I would not give one star if I had the option This app will start to play a station then it will have another music station overlapping the first. I tried updating. Did not work. I tried un installing. Not working again. This app needs work."
29024,"Pandora",2013-04-04,5,"What did we do before Pandora! This is an amazing service You are not limited to a certain style of music and have virtually every type of music at your finger tips Therefore Pandora is suitable for any age group or taste in music. . . One can even have numerous different stations depending on your mood of the day . . . . .Bravo Pandora!"
29031,"Pandora",2014-07-17,5,"Pandora is a great app. I have it on my android Phone ... Pandora is a great app. I have it on my android Phone HTC Thunderbolt my laptop and my android tablet.

29060,"Pandora",2012-12-20,4,"Great app I love using Pandora. The only problem I have with this app is: I haven't found a way to scroll back through previously played music to rate like or dislike. I would like that option because I like to turn it on and just let it play while I cook or clean. The more you like or dislike a song the more Pandora learns your style."
29061,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Five Stars Nice to listen to all my favorite songs one after another"
29066,"Pandora",2015-11-22,5,"Fantastic! Thank goodness apps like these exist. Sometimes I get bored of the radio or my own music. This fills the gap perfectly!"

29099,"Pandora",2013-06-17,5,"Love Pandora! Love Pandora. Sound quality is great! If you already have a Pandora account you will be able to use this with ease.

29100,"Pandora",2016-03-01,1,"Limited I had to use Spotify instead because it did not let me download the app in Argentina. Ridiculous."
29101,"Pandora",2014-04-03,5,"easy to select your favorite artist and. music I like it. Music selections fit. well in My initial selection. Theme. All I had to do was to type in a artist name the music began to play. It also provided artist history ad album cover. I hadn't discovered all of te abilities but I will."
29102,"Pandora",2015-01-01,5,"Five Stars Love it"
29103,"Pandora",2013-08-16,1,"do not get it I really do not get this app. While trying to listen to music different songs would start playing and I could not shut it off. Very dangerous if you have kids do not let them use this app as you do not know what song will turn on. I immediately deleted this app minutes after buying it."

29133,"Pandora",2016-01-30,4,"Love the music but wish the ads were softer I love being able to play music at night while rocking the baby but I hate that the volume of the ads are so much louder than the music that it wakes him up. The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed but the ads themselves really do not bother me. Just how loud they are. I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies. That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."
29138,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"great even with commercial Easy to set stations and I can get everything Icelandic rock to children's disney classics.Just wish it was working right now...."

29191,"Pandora",2015-01-28,3,"ehhhh The reason I do not like it is because you do not get to choose what song you want to listen to so I like spotify better but you should try it I do not like it but it is your opinion."

Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about and 4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost since I have the free version but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

30164,"Pandora",2014-04-25,1,"Pandora One upgrade? More like Pandora NONE! Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad free pandora one i started getting error messages. never received an error message before upgradingit got continuously worse sometimes shutting down the app completely other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them they have NO PHONE NUMBER i emailed them per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non paying customer. I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they would never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point but i do not have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they did not deserve that money at all.Long story short i am busy and before too long some other nightmare in my life took center stage and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so thanks a lot Pandora for your upgraded product PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

Getting my billing straight as I am a Pandora One subscriber took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it is not broke do not fix it. Sometimes I can not connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free wifi and that is annoying and disappointing."

30423,"Pandora",2016-11-25,5,"Five Stars Great app"
30437,"Pandora",2014-04-14,4,"Suprisingly Amazing Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station Pandora deciders the type of music you are looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I have found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can not seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."
30438,"Pandora",2014-07-14,5,"Love Its free music who would not love it! One request though is there any way you can make it to where you have an option of listening to just the person you want instead of having many other bands."
30449,"Pandora",2013-12-25,5,"Pandora Love Pandora The selection of music genera and artiest is great; the more you use it and mark your likes and dislikes of songs and artists the better Pandora gets at playing the music you like. Would highly recommend trying it."

30496,"Pandora",2015-05-14,3,"I do not like that you can not find and play one song I do not like that you can not find and play one song. Also all the adds can become annoying when your trying to jam out to some music."

WT number percent dollar ???And unless you get the paid version you cannot do many editings ie Liking or Disliking or FF a song.If you can put up with that it is OK then."

Also I listen to it at work and if you do not Like or Dislike evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ARE YOU THERE WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE do not LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM what the ????I mean really?

32343,"Pandora",2015-04-20,4,"Pandora is a fine way to listen to what you like in music. I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows what you like it will play songs from that artist or era 80's rock. I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it is free with small pop up ads or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"

33009,"Pandora",2013-07-25,5,"Customize your own Radio Stations This app is a nifty program! I was looking for an all in one app something like iTunes but they do not make iTunes for my device and this one came closest to the mark.You can listen three ways: Upload all your own music Purchase music from Pandora Listen to unlimited free music in the form of radio stations The feature I like the most is the Radio Station maker . You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.For example if you like a specific genre of music you can choose that search feature Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike you click on skip button and it will be discarded from your station.You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.You can make other radio stations and keep the many different stations you make in a library by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.You can make radio stations of a single band specific genre's or many other different ways.it is a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love and even find other bands you have never heard before based on music you like.The app comes in a free ad based version the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials.Great music listening software!"
33015,"Pandora",2014-05-17,5,"Pandora is an excellent app that allow you to try out similar artists I recommend Pandora strongly and listen to it exclusively instead of radio. It is worth paying for a subscription to get rid of those pesky commercials."

33825,"Pandora",2015-12-23,5,"Five Stars what is not to like?! happy"
33828,"Pandora",2015-03-23,5,"Five Stars Love it. Only minor issue is the number of commercials but they are over quickly."
33830,"Pandora",2016-03-24,3,"Use Spotify it is better anyway The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire not necessarily for Pandora as a whole. There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to. If you do not Pandora just stops does not play any more music but stays open. There is not any way to skip or pause the music unless you once again physically open the app. You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song. The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone iPod or laptop versions."
33832,"Pandora",2013-11-02,5,"finally got the update open For those of you who struggled getting the new Pandora open i tired turning my kindle off and then on again. that is when it finally worked. Other than that i love the update"

It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way the next track will not play. This is just sh tty and weird from my experience. Oh wait. there is one more thing that does not work; it is the search engine for music stations which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review I really do not recommend this..."

I do not mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I am using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he does not really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off but only to help with little ones music. If that was not the case I would have no problem at all with not paying. So do not delay! Download today!

My only real complaint about Pandora is that you cannot press thumbs down an unlimited amount of times. It keeps giving me R and B type songs for some reason and it will not let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."

38724,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Great app for selecting the music you like and deleting the music you do not. Wide variety of music choices. Wonderful choice of on line music that allows you to add favorites to your playlist and delete forever songs that you do not like.This is a wonderful choice for those who do not want to listen to secular music with bad language and adult themes but get tired of listening to Christian radio and limited song choices.it is free to use and you can customize see lyrics and select the music you want to hear. It really does not get much better.We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently but for a free service it is well worth it.It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list."
38728,"Pandora",2014-01-11,4,"Making a station when you make a channel it only plays a few songs from that artist. it should play more of them."

Ever since downloading this I have even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I have locked in Usher and it is been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. it is super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you do not like it will skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.I recommend this for ANY music lover you will not regret it and it is free."

I subscribe to Pandora radio...but I subscribed through GooglePlay 6 months ago.I downloaded the app onto my new Kindle..logged in...and no music.It shows the album art and everything like normal....but not a sound. Maybe because I originally got it through Google?? This is not cool.I am starting to see this Kindle as a waste of dollar dollar and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon. My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it will not play on this thing."

So why does it say I do not own it and therefore can not use it glitch free?"

41980,"Pandora",2016-09-01,1,"Hostage. Aweful! Worked well at first but it seems the service just gets more annoying the longer you go without upgrading. I can barely get one song to play with out it freezing up and it not a speed or equipment issue as it does the same thing on several devices and at any speed."
41981,"Pandora",2014-11-30,5,"Love it. I do not mind ONE commercial here and ... Love it. I do not mind ONE commercial here and There. My only comment is that once in a while you have to uninstall and re install from device or devises even wen you have it regularly updated still tilts from time to time like twice a year. No biggie since it is free and great app."
41982,"Pandora",2016-02-11,1,"STUPID When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001 percent of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes.

Thank you!"
41986,"Pandora",2012-12-09,5,"Pandora I love this product. I have it on m home computer my iPhone my iPad and my Kindle. Love it."
41987,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"TERRIBLE for Kindle Fire HD works on other Android tablets I use Pandora often on my computer so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire HD and my daughters' tablets. While it works fine on the Android tablets Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire. It takes forever to load and usually multiple tries; it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well when I try to turn Pandora off it will not shut off. I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire. Two stars because it does in fact work on other tablets. DO NOT get the app if you have a Kindle."
41991,"Pandora",2012-11-25,5,"Pandora is great. It is the best way to get all the music I like. I play it all the time. It very easy to use."
41995,"Pandora",2016-11-02,5,"Pretty cool! I have only used it for a few days but it seems really neat. I can just pick an artist type the name and teh musci from taht artist plays. Pretty cool!"
41996,"Pandora",2016-05-02,4,"will not Accept me Signing Up!!! So I got this app and signed up. After I entered my info it would not let me sign up! I tried new passwords but to no avail! What exactly could be the problem? I am familiar with Pandora and I think it is an awesome app so I am giving it a four star rating because it is awesome but will not let me sign up!"
41997,"Pandora",2017-06-12,4,"I have gone back to Pandora I have moved back to pandora from Spotify due to increased music selection. could and probably will get better"
42005,"Pandora",2015-12-12,1,"It will not play the songs. Everything else works thumbs up thumbs down skip but it will not load the songs at all."
42007,"Pandora",2013-01-16,5,"Never knew about it A friend of mine had this app on her phone and I did not even know what it was. I thought it was awesome and downloaded it onto my kindle. Very neat and easily able to be customized."
42008,"Pandora",2014-07-10,5,"Five Stars love this"
42009,"Pandora",2012-11-28,5,"Love pandora I use it all the time for every music mood. Plus i can listen to all sorts of comedy too"
42016,"Pandora",2013-01-10,5,"excellent I love the fact you can make your own station. It plays the songs you like. It goes with you."
42018,"Pandora",2013-11-13,3,"Where did the sleep timer go? I saw that a sleep timer had been added but with the new update it is gone again. What happened? The only reason I put this app on my kindle was so I could fall asleep to relaxing music."
42024,"Pandora",2014-11-29,3,"I find the loop of music too short. I ... I find the loop of music too short. I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs which should not be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there. Also when I click on the Beatles station I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens. Yes I am on shuffle but I thought when I was on a station I would hear at least a lot of that music. But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't updated to the no advertisement membership because I do not mind them. I thought perhaps if I did upgrade I would get a longer time between repeat songs but that is not what no ads means so I am not sure that would solve the problem."
42027,"Pandora",2016-09-16,5,"LOVE IT and HATE IT Love every purpose intended.... but like when I run out of skips it happens to stations I have listened to in days. And a few times every time I skip it sometimes plays the same song back to back three times in a row. Other than the stupid small flaws.... I love it"
42028,"Pandora",2012-01-21,5,"great app why is everyone crying about free music???? this app is awesome Works great plays exactly what I want to hear every time."
42033,"Pandora",2014-04-20,3,"it is okay okay"
42035,"Pandora",2015-02-13,2,"Poor Qualtiy and Selecton I find that when you create a radio station that the same songs play over and over again. In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as Simon and Garfunkel. I know S and G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many songs you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at 'live' events I prefer the higher quality studio songs I do not seem to have any choice in the issue. No longer using Pandora."
42038,"Pandora",2012-05-08,4,"love it Ok so I discovered Pandora and fell in love with it. I like that I can change and create my own stations."
42043,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"yes I am so new at this...I love being able to find my favorites. I would recommend this to anyone that I know that has Kindle. I was surprised at the quality of music on my Kindle."
42045,"Pandora",2016-09-28,5,"Five Stars I like the fact I am able to pick the songs i like"
42047,"Pandora",2016-09-25,1,"My account shows that I have this app but ... My account shows that I have this app but I do not Every time I click on it it says my 'session has timed out' although I just tried opening it and other times it says that 'an account cannot be set up for me at this time' or words to that effect."
42048,"Pandora",2015-11-08,3,"Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want I have a complaint. . . My Elvis Presley channel plays one to two of Elvis songs in a hour. I hear more Waylon and Johnnie cash than Elvis. The same goes for all the other channels I set. Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want?"
42049,"Pandora",2014-05-24,1,"auto closes before i can start uses Another app that will not open just goes back to home screen of the kindle. Very annoying. But hey that is what my droid and iPod are for.....right?"
42050,"Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly Pandora used to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed. You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program. It does not support the menu button. It turns on and off randomly so you can not let it idle in the background. Perfect now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car leave the car and let the app shut itself down it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I am in a meeting or library. Awesome.... Fix your app Pandora. There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium these issues."
42052,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"do not like their official app Too many ads"
42054,"Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"starting to hate ... why all of a sudden it only play 1 minute of every song but plays complete commercials??????? Get this fixed ASAP!!!"
42055,"Pandora",2016-09-04,5,"Great Love this! However too many and too long pauses. Guess I am having trouble with streaming. I am not tech savvy so I am at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
42056,"Pandora",2012-02-24,5,"got the droid x update Got the droid x update and now it does not shut down on me anymore! Love it! Works better than slacker imo"
42062,"Pandora",2016-04-06,1,"Tired of it taking over my camera.... This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone."
42065,"Pandora",2016-05-10,3,"Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in ... I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the dollar 15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription they did not have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
42074,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"SMOOTH JAZZ I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate relax after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......A"
42082,"Pandora",2016-06-30,5,"GET THIS APP!!!!!!! happy GET THIS GAME you CAN LISTEN TO ALL YOUR SONGS AND you CAN SEARCH THEM TOOPLUS you CAN PUT THUMPS UP OR DOWN BUT I LOVE THIS APP IF I WERE you I WOULD GET THIS APP!! happy P.S.

42088,"Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"Waaaaaaaaaay too many ads and limitations Used to be ok but now is loaded with ads you have to watch or listen too and limitations they try to force you to subscribe at dollar 5 a month. No thanks Removed."
42091,"Pandora",2016-12-16,1,"Alarm clock feature broken Whether it is Pandora's problem or Amazon's this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there is one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100 percent of the time it is an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times maybe alarm related?. Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
42097,"Pandora",2017-03-23,5,"I love listening to only the kinds of music I enjoy ... I love listening to only the kinds of music I enjoy and after a couple of days using Pandora that is what I got . The commercials are brief and few so the free version is still very good . It was very user friendly and simple to navigate through . I think this is a good app ."
42110,"Pandora",2014-04-08,5,"Awesome App! Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. it is genious! Great was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it is an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
42116,"Pandora",2013-08-23,5,"music ok"
42117,"Pandora",2016-06-06,5,"I have discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to. I can not live without my Pandora now. Takes a little patience to develop the perfect playlist like a couple/three sessions of thumbs up or down but it is SO worth it. I have discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to."
42119,"Pandora",2016-05-17,4,"sometimes good sometimes not quite Works well and introduces you to new music similar to the station you choose. sometimes good sometimes not quite. Still a good way to learn and appreciate all the great music there is. Just wish in the Classical stations they would play the entire piece rather than movements or excerpts. Guess listening to something longer than a few minutes is very old school."
42122,"Pandora",2016-10-09,5,"Problems with pandora I like Pandora. I would like you to do something for me. I have cerebral palsy and I like the best of Ronnie dove and dusty Springfield. I also like leslie gore and early brenda lee. The thing is they are under different categories . I would them all under leslie gore so that I can listen to all together. Thank you for your attention."
42126,"Pandora",2017-03-22,5,"AWESOME APP awesome app need to get it.they have AWESOME apps.if you think of getting it you should todaly and I am 9 years old and I really like this game the most of all games."
42129,"Pandora",2017-02-05,3,"Not my most pleasureable app It will take some time to get used to the format."
42130,"Pandora",2017-04-25,1,"One Star amazon tablets are trash"
42133,"Pandora",2015-08-20,2,"felt like it was intentional for the benefit of advertisers Upgraded to Pandora one and was still inundated with advertisements until I complained to customer service ... took some time but they fixed it .. still felt like it was intentional for the benefit of advertisers."
42138,"Pandora",2016-12-19,1,"unable to access I was not able to log in so I did not use the app on my Kindle. Pandora said they could not log me in so maybe it was my mistake but after two tries I gave up."
42142,"Pandora",2015-07-28,5,"Internet Radio at its finest. Its the evolution of broadcast radio but better. I knew Pandora was available online but I was delighted to find an app for it that works with my KindleFire. The sound is incredible. This app easily plays in the background while reading an e book or surfing the web. I program only the types of music that I want to hear and it provides the lyrics to most songs allowing you to become familiar with the artists the titles and the albums of the songs you are hearing for future purchase if you so choose."
42151,"Pandora",2017-03-24,5,"Beyond a radio stand in; still the best music discovery tool I love Pandora and have been following it since the beginning. I told my dad that it would be everywhere one day and I will be darned if it is not standard in a lot of cars and TVs now. It still beats all the new services like Spotify since I think the system of music DNA they use is better at creating channels that introduce you to new music."
42152,"Pandora",2013-07-30,5,"Hi again If you like one of them you liked them all. I do not understand why it is a limit on your response."
42154,"Pandora",2017-01-15,4,"Pandora Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad but it does not repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station I want the majority of music from that group not everyone but the group."
42155,"Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Love it; listen to it constantly! Exposed to a huge variety of music. I did not realize the many different types of music and artist I liked. Con: classical music will be truncated you will not hear an entire symphony"
42159,"Pandora",2017-03-09,4,"it a place to listen to music I have been using pandora for a few year love this music stations you can make so much freedom to do what you want but there adds so only 4 stari know they need to make money but every time you skip a song play a add overkill... still a great place to listen to music if you want to start it and forget about so you do other thing and not have start a new video are pick new song every time a song ends."
42160,"Pandora",2013-01-22,4,"only one minor problem Pandora is free it is great for finding new music in a particular genre. The only problem is it keeps playing after you exit the app that is great if you want music while you work on other things but not so great if you do not I cannot find any way to shut it off other than turning the whole Kindle off."
42161,"Pandora",2013-03-22,4,"welcome music lovers! This app is great! Love the ideas it gives you for similar music and artists! Also like shuffle feature and abilityto control which artist or genres it shuffles. Only thing that is mildly irritating is how slowly it goes back and forthto show you info re. artist words to lyrics similar artists etc. But that could be my Kindles problem or internetspeed. Over all I love it!"
42164,"Pandora",2014-06-16,1,"terrible You should not get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it would not even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
42165,"Pandora",2016-08-28,4,"Great if your on Wifi Pandora is great for finding music similar to what I like. I use it on my PC all the time. I do not use it on my phone much since it uses the cell data plan when not on Wifi. It would be great if it would download say 30 minutes of music to listen to off line. Then I could use it on my commute to/from work and such without paying me for cell data."
42168,"Pandora",2016-07-19,5,"Better than a radio!! You can pick your own great tunes and is super easy to navigate if you want to skip a song. it is great for grouping similar artists without one having to do it themselves."
42169,"Pandora",2013-10-04,3,"Frustrated I keep getting a constant message saying sorry we have no more songs to play on this station please select another. I reported it numerous times to Pandora and I get the same response from them were sorry for the frustration..try this...were sorry try this...and try that... I have deactivated my account 4 times and it still keeps happening. I have Pandora One which is dollar 3.99 a month and I am ready to cancel it."
42171,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"create your own radio station This is a first rate site! I love picking my own type of music and choosing or deleting songs by a particular artistuntil I only have songs I love from that artist!It is free if you do not mind some quick commercials or you may purchase the site for amonthly rate or by the year."
42175,"Pandora",2017-04-29,3,"Alright on Fire I love Pandora so this is a review of the app for amazon. It kinda sucks on Fire but I am going to assume that is because I purchased a marginally acceptable dollar 39 tablet.."

42179,"Pandora",2013-09-23,5,"Great I have had it for years...Love it.I have it on my phone computer Roku and now my Kindle. Thanks"
42180,"Pandora",2013-12-05,3,"3 It use to work perfectly not any more. Now every time I try to open it it just freezes on the Pandora screen."
42182,"Pandora",2013-11-19,2,"BSOD Used to work great then stopped. I updated hoping it would fix it but made it worse. It used to begin playing eventually after a few times of exiting and restarting program. Now it usually will not. Also I play lullabies for my baby when it works and before the update there were rarely commercials. Now loud multiple ones play at random which is fine when she is awake sucks when she just dozed off."
42184,"Pandora",2015-09-11,5,"Pandora is my go to I have Pandora on every device we own as a family. I have been using it for years. It is great for all ages and I even pay for Pandora One on my personal device Love having no commercials. But even with commercials its great. All types of music and even kids songs! Plug it in your car we use at cook outs camping just around the house while cleaning!"
42185,"Pandora",2014-08-21,2,"Total noise and disruptive with the frequency and number of ads The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening it may as well be listed and advertised as a freebie trial version. I have never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app. I would have to buy the ad free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype I was totally disappointed."
42191,"Pandora",2017-04-14,1,"They play good music once ina blue moon I switched to spotify ... They play good music once ina blue moon I switched to spotify it is 10000000 times better!!!!!!! you can add the songs you like to your library!!"
42194,"Pandora",2016-05-17,1,"Awful I chose 50s country. Rockabilly with Patsy Cline Rick Nelson and others played for a few minutes. Not necessarily my favorite but not bad.Then out of the blue the next song began playing horrible lyrics with the F bomb repeating over and over and OVER as I frantically tried to close it.Last time I checked 50s country did NOT have those lyrics!!!I exited that app never to return. I will stick to my iheartradio thank you."
42202,"Pandora",2017-03-19,5,"Love Pandora Love Pandora and how easy it is to customize. Even the free version is not that ad filled. Have it on all my mobile devices."
42203,"Pandora",2014-01-07,1,"will not work on my fire hd 8.9 One star due to the lack of function on my kindle fire hd. I love my pandora on my droid phone."
42209,"Pandora",2016-05-03,3,"Pandora is a mixed bag It has quite a lot of music available for streaming but in my opinion setting up your radio station is not very user friendly or intuitive."
42210,"Pandora",2016-10-13,5,"Love Pandora and everything about it except the commercials but ... Love Pandora and everything about it except the commercials but hey that is what you have to live with when it is for free!"
42211,"Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"Music you do not even know you want! Although I am a new user Pandora has been around long enough to use listener preferences to assemble a great anticipated playlist. It is an easy start up even for those of us who are on the downhill side of life. The commercials are not a bad price for such a quality service."
42215,"Pandora",2016-12-26,1,"I have yet to be able to log into this ... I have yet to be able to log into this app. I have not been able to log into it due to technical problems or so it says."
42216,"Pandora",2013-08-13,4,"Music ... Music yes but unless you go for more than the free app you are not choosing your music. It is Pandora 'radio ' not Pandora 'you pick it you play it.' If you do not like the chosen song you must still listen to it.It may not be just what I wanted but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free you can not hardly go wrong with this one. sticking tongue out"
42222,"Pandora",2014-04-06,1,"do not get this app. I deleted it after I downloaded it onto my phone. When I agreed to permissions during the download it said I could change them in my settings after the download was completed. This is not true. And I do not like the idea of them having access to all my files photos etc. So I got rid of the app. I have Slacker radio anyway so I do not really need Pandora too."
42226,"Pandora",2014-11-08,1,"My kids love it; but my experience was awful After I downloaded I never got in successfully to listen to any music. It kept spooling and then after it had me set up my user name and password twice it told me that there was an error and to contact their support. After 5 minutes of waiting I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone. My kids love it; but my experience was awful. iheartradios was smooth and easy to download and I have never had a problem with it......guess I will use that from now on."
42227,"Pandora",2013-09-02,1,"What a shame. I use this app all the time on my phone so I was excited to see it in the Amazon app store. I downloaded it opened it at work and... It worked great! Once. Now I have been unable to even get past the blue start up screen. I have tried uninstalling an reinstalling turning my wifi on and off and restarting my Kindle. No dice. Would give five stars but the app simply does not work."
42228,"Pandora",2015-12-30,1,"will not play on kindle fire Like many other recent reviewers said the app does not work on kindle fire or at least not on mine and theirs. Everything but the actual music will work I can see the songs playing they just do not make any noise despite having the volume up. I am disappointed and I hope they offer a solution soon."
42230,"Pandora",2016-09-27,1,"Was a great music media app More music then all the thousands of dollars that I wish I saved VS what was wasted on CDs and tapes LPs and cassettes and Itunes it is a good app BUT now they stop it after 15 min.s of play Ask you if your still listening it stinks now before it was like a radio with your favorite songs Now you have to press the button and start it again Time to get another app many others so long Maybe back if you go back to the old way"
42235,"Pandora",2016-09-21,2,"Breaks often Often need to uninstall reinstall and losing all your favorites. When it works very nice even with annoying commercials."
42237,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"Best music product! Pandora is a creative and entertaining way to receive music from your favorite artists. You type In an artist and Pandora will play songs and artists that are similar to the artists genre. While you listen to music you may go online or play games at the same time. Pandora allows you to skip a limited amount of tracks. You can only skip about 5 songs on that station. Although you may skip about five more tracks again after an hour. There is also ads between songs but probably after every 5 or more songs. You can pay with an ad free experience with Pandora for around dollar 6.00. Another thing I like about Pandora is that if you see a song you like it will ask you if you want to buy it on iTunes or bookmark it. On Pandora you cannot replay a track or rewind it. I enjoy my experience with pandora and I think it is worth buying."
42239,"Pandora",2013-12-07,1,"Have always loved Pandora I have always loved Pandora but on my Kindle it will not open up other than showing me the blue green opening Pandora screen. Really sucks cause I have been a loyal Pandora user for a long time. Hopefully it gets fixed."
42243,"Pandora",2015-03-17,5,"easy to use huge music library We have Pandora streaming to our kindle and via a Roku to our TV. The install on each device was easy. We set up 1 station and enjoyed hours of music on it. I like the variety on the menus of song titles I am anticipating being able to change collections of music easily and doubt that I will get bored."
42249,"Pandora",2016-05-05,4,"Pandora! I love the Pandora app a lot but it has so many glitches. Like one of them is that it will not let me delete my bookmarks. I tried to delete the app and reinstall it and see if that was the issue but it was not please fix it! But other than that the design of the app is awesomes."
42256,"Pandora",2015-01-05,5,"Beats Spotify radio Pandora is wonderful you have to train your stations just a little at first but once you do it is fabulous. Much better than Spotify's radio function which offers little variety. it is obvious how much time and care they put into the music genome project."
42259,"Pandora",2017-07-01,4,"Great music app. A fine way to take music along as you go. I do not like the commercials but the price is right."
42266,"Pandora",2016-03-28,2,"can not open I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Pandora app on my Galaxy Note 4 TWICE in the last 3 weeks. I would like to note that I PAY dollar 4.99 a month for Pandora...whatever glitch they have going on with this and number 34;new and improved and number 34; app needs to addressed PRONTO!"
42272,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"Spotify is much better... Get Spotify not Pandora."
42274,"Pandora",2016-03-16,1,"does not work I had 2 stations and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials but the songs would not play and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that did not work. Ridiculous."
42281,"Pandora",2015-10-21,5,"I can not live without Pandora! I love my Pandora! I can stream the music I am in the mood for anytime anywhere on my desktop computer any mobile device and in my car using my aux cable to my phone all commercial free. I can create stations by a favorite artist and all similar will play. I have discovered a few new artists this way that have become favorites as well! I do not need CDs Satellite radio an MP3 player or anything!"
42285,"Pandora",2015-05-30,3,"also woul like more diversity in music i do not think i should have to pay for pandora one also woul like more diversity in music like on sirusxm i am unable to subscribe to this doe to my bose soundtouch20 was not informed of this ehen i purchased this system. be careful when buying this system as they told me i would be able to purchase this station. however i like pandora but i like a little more than what you get on the pop stations!"
42286,"Pandora",2013-04-05,5,"Great Music I enjoy Pandora because I can listen to the type of music I like and I don;t have to keep changing the station I just put in the type of music I like and they just keep pulling up artist that play that kind of music"
42287,"Pandora",2013-12-02,1,"Worthless I can not log on to Pandora with this POS. we are experiencing unexpected technical errors. I can get in with browsers but not with this thing. it is deleted from my Kindle."
42289,"Pandora",2017-10-13,3,"Three Stars When I switched to Premium I started having a lot of problems with the app."
42294,"Pandora",2013-11-21,1,"It stopped working sad !! Before the newest update Pandora was doing just fine and know when ever I try to open it it ether crashes or it will not load any o the songs. It just seas 00:00 00:00 and will not play the song and just sits there. I have tried un installing it and re installing it but nothing changed sadly. I was happy with the app until know."
42296,"Pandora",2014-01-24,5,"Really like my Pandora. I was using the free Pandora with the ads and my husband told me about this. I really like that I do not have to deal with advertisements while listening to my music."
42297,"Pandora",2017-06-17,5,"Had a great selection of you like new age Has everything.. Had a great selection of you like new age."
42299,"Pandora",2015-03-02,1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ... When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month. All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they did not get paid. Instead of contacting me they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs and actually froze up. I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall and then re install Pandora. Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements and I think I am going to leave it that way because I have the feeling they just want more. I do not mind paying but really when you pick a music theme or performer it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
42316,"Pandora",2016-03-14,1,"Accounts for me do not work because I can not remember the passwords also so many passwords require a specific way to create a pass I do not completely have this app because I need to set up an account. Accounts for me do not work because I can not remember the passwords alsoso many passwords require a specific way to create a password like a upper case letter and a number in the password which really make s it too hard for me. This app is not worth it because of the creating an account for it."
42319,"Pandora",2014-01-03,3,"My friends tell me Pandora is awesome. I cannot get access to it because I get tangled up in all of the passwords needed to log in.Is anything being done about making electronic gadgets more user friendly in terms of access??There are passwords for everything!Can you take a picture of our eyes and use that for all log ins?"
42321,"Pandora",2013-07-31,1,"Not working : It does not open the app at all! What can I do now? I need to get this up running on here."
42327,"Pandora",2017-10-09,4,"Enjoyzble without having to select Enjoyable range of music through affirmation of the tunes I want to hear pandora algorithms do a good job of predicting what I want to hear without me having to think about it. I use the free service so there are commercials though"

42334,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Amazing with a problem. This is a great app for music lover's! You can listen to the music while doing something else at the same time. The only bad thing is that you can only skip five songs a hour and adds come endless you by membership or whatever it is called"
42335,"Pandora",2013-01-22,5,"Good for ambience I hosted a sewing party and used Pandora on my Kindle to give us some interesting background noise . After 5 solid hours without pauses in service or repeated tracks I am a happy camper."

42341,"Pandora",2017-03-02,5,"Five Stars So needed keeping my high on tunes"
42343,"Pandora",2014-01-04,5,"For Music Lovers I have actually had Pandora for years. it is the place I can go to when I want to listen to the music I like to hear gospel. I can choose who and what I like and Pandora will add the same type of music to my choices; if I like it I can keep it and if not I can just give it a thumbs down and I will not have to hear it anymore. I happen to like my Pandora commercial free so I pay a small yearly fee for that luxury but if you do not mind the commercials you do not have to pay anything to enjoy your kind of music."
42353,"Pandora",2014-01-06,5,"awesome I think this app is really great especially on kindle cause you can not download music. I really think we should have more apps like this!!!"

42375,"Pandora",2015-02-18,4,"half music half silence It will play a song of two then go quiet for five to ten minutes. Then it will play a commercial then start over again. it is very agitating. I tried to contract Pandora to fix the problem and never got a response. I have uninstalled it the reinstalled it; it did not work."
42377,"Pandora",2013-03-02,5,"If you love music... Pandora is great I love using Pandora. It is easy to set up. It is easy to customize. The more you use it... the thumbs up/thumbs down skip... the better it makes your music selections."
42380,"Pandora",2014-02-09,1,"Pandora = Awesome Pandora must be in the habit of spoofing reviews of itself.

42394,"Pandora",2013-06-20,1,"Poor reception I live in New Hampshire and the reception is spotty at best. The songs are constantly breaking up. Not the top notch service I thought it would be.

42402,"Pandora",2017-10-12,3,"Three Stars it is okay"
42408,"Pandora",2013-05-25,3,"eh.. it used to be better when you did not have a certain ammount of time a month to listen. you only get forty free hours. its not the best any more :/ disappointing."
42409,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Great app listen to it all the time. I really like this app. I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money. I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home. At home I connect to a bluetooth speaker. When a call comes in the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again. Unlimited music selection."
42410,"Pandora",2016-12-12,1,"Not happy with new version I am getting tired of the newest version opening up no matter what I do not want. I exited out of it 5 x yesterday. After I quit. I may have to delete."
42413,"Pandora",2016-06-25,3,"Why you are in politics? The reason that I am not giving five stars is that Pandora is restricted to some people in some other countrys.This is a music Media not a political establishemnt."

Pandora is a really cost effective way to listen to the music that fits your tastes. it is a very effective tool to broaden your music horizons as well because the very intuitive music selection system leads you into other songs and artists that you may not have known or appreciated otherwise. it is a very good way to reflect your musical preferences without becoming too tunnel visioned in your musical tastes."
42495,"Pandora",2013-11-17,1,"Slow Before the most recent updates I loved Pandora. Now Pandora is super slow and takes at least 5 minutes to load. Compared to iheartradio which takes about 10 seconds. Until the next update I will be using iheartradio."

42514,"Pandora",2016-10-02,3,"ok There are commercials unless you pay for it I do but dollar 4/month does not seem that high. I believe Spotify is the only other major streaming service at the moment. Wish you could pick out specific songs to play or make up specific play lists."

42606,"Pandora",2016-12-16,5,"Pandora is a very neat and free streaming music service. I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system. I like the ability to enter the specific artist whose style of music you prefer and find artists few people have even heard of. I have the free service with few commercials that really do not bother me as they as so short."

42664,"Pandora",2013-02-07,5,"Pandora totally lets me customize my music... Pandora is amazing. My daughter listens to Christian music and Pandora is so totally customizable that I tend to think of Pandora as a Christian radio station. It is anything but a Christian radio station since you can listen to anything else one friend of mine has a classic rock station. You can make it into anything you want.The commercials do not bother me at all. So far there've only been decent ads regular TV spots and I think that this is one of the electronic products that you can opt out of the ad after so many seconds into the ad. Some of the ads are good that is interesting at least to me.Great product. I can not recommend it highly enough."

42683,"Pandora",2017-06-09,3,"The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free. However I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music which was the reason I bought the item. There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists. When I ask for a specific artist it seems to always start with the same song. The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good. I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."

For this app in particular...Well let me first start off with this. I have been a huge Pandora fan for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio but I can not. I But now I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first but I am used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0 MY STATIONS do not PLAY. It keeps saying 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora you are about to lose a customer if you do not get it together."

42960,"Pandora",2016-03-05,4,"Pandora is becoming the new classic! I have had a paid subscription to Pandora for about a year now and it is been pretty decent. The service has been almost flawless a month ago I did an upgrade of the app on my iphone 4s and Pandora started crashing buffering errors and freezing. It took 2 weeks for a newer version to be available for download after downloading the newer version the program stopped crashing buffering errors and freezing. The one other thing that bothers me is that Pandora will not let you skip as many songs as you want even though you are a paid subscriber. I understand they have to pay for every song played or skipped but I am paying them to be able to skip at my leisure and they wont allow it. The stations I create are always compiled great and the thumb print radio feature plays all my likes which is really cool. There are other music streaming apps out there but to me Pandora is the most well rounded as far as having the most songs and artist I like. I use Pandora on my computer and all my devices as for now I am going to keep using Pandora until something better is available."

43032,"Pandora",2017-07-07,4,"Kindle Fire HD8 2016 Edit: Found an update which was not showing up when I wrote the original review actually had to search for Pandora in the app store rather than just looking at my app downloads which brought me to the Pandora app page in the store but all it said was open and not update in order to be able to download the update. Sound quality is fixed but the song name still does not change when the song does.Original Review: Audio quality sounds terrible compared to my 2012 KFHD7 I use High Quality in both devices. App does not display the new song title when the song changes. Videos on mobile YouTube sound 10x better than this version of the Pandora App. App needs to be fixed as it is not playing high quality audio and is not updating the name of the song."

It was not showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps though there was an icon on the home screen. So I went to the Amazon App Store from which I had installed the app and acted like I wanted to install it again. It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened. I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music then closed the app. I expected not to be able to re launch the app but lo and behold it launched fine. I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still was not listed perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store. Regardless I am upping my stars from two to four.I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices smart TVs etc. and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic. It installed but will not launch. If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556 I am all ears!"

43100,"Pandora",2012-05-19,5,"great! this is a good app. it is free it has a lot of songs and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres too. this app only has a few downsides it can only skip 6 times per hour per station and when you thumbs down a song a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying. some people want this app to upgrade which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people do not know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs genres and handles skipping and artists that you do not like very well. this costs dollar 40 a year but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora. I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
43104,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Great app for all kinds of music. We love Pandora. We listen to it all the time whether at home or on the go. It has all the songs of the 40s 50's to present day. And any kind from Country Western. pop R and B or what ever. Great app."

43113,"Pandora",2017-08-15,2,"Dumbed down and prices raised = lousy annoying arrogant Pandora Was a huge fan of Pandora for years decent price easy to navigate on screen good music selections many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons. Plus for this downgrade in features and functions they started charging more money per month. Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel NO REFUNDS you just have to wait till your subscription runs out. So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers. Maybe it is ok for your cell phone but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there I have switched to Amazon Music."
43117,"Pandora",2016-11-21,4,"Allows access to your Pandora station listing The app allows access to your previously selected stations. Functions well. Making changes to any of your selections is easier by visiting the website then use the app to access what you have already set up."

43123,"Pandora",2017-03-09,4,"Four stars. I love Pandora. They had a really great idea and an awesome music selection but the reason I gave the app only 4 stars is because the app does not always open when you click on it or it looks like it will open then it closes without me ever touching it! I do realize that the app"
43126,"Pandora",2013-01-15,4,"awesome music app great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of 5 or 6 Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"

This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I am very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
43160,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"GREAT Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to"
43163,"Pandora",2016-04-20,4,"A Great Place for Music I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I have chosen. To be honest I have only downloaded the app because I do not want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I have created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I am listening to is truly top notch.In a nutshell I really do not do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."
43168,"Pandora",2014-04-18,5,"Always liked Pandora Also have Desktop App From Inception! I use other music services too but Pandora is a go to.do not forget that it is enjoyable to get specific music you like to listen too. It seems this will be a standard now.In order to preserve all these services do not forget to shut it down when your not listening. Mind you they do not pay a lot of money to the music industry per song but those costs can build up. Act accordingly and services like this will get better and better. Or go out of business."
43178,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"One of the best music apps! We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
43179,"Pandora",2016-04-03,5,"Amazing!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. it is amazing! I very much recommend this app!"
43180,"Pandora",2013-06-23,5,"Pandora is my Magic Box Music is my passion. I love many genres. However it was difficult to know how to access new music. By creating my personal stations on Pandora I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world. I listen to Pandora every day and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals. I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists when I purchase music. Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift! I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it is worth every penny!"

43186,"Pandora",2013-01-18,5,"A song for every season Pandora has a genre of songs for any music lover and the best part is that it syncs to my smartphone computer and Roku. If I sign in on what ever device there is my list! Great selection of 70's rock contemporary Christian and Cool Jazz."
43187,"Pandora",2017-02-05,5,"Listen to the music you want to hear. I use Echo to access Pandora. I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists. When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist. My only complaint is that the volume control do not control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder."
43188,"Pandora",2016-06-01,5,"Favorite I love the variety of music that you can get with Pandora and I especially love the fact that you can set the station to whoever your favorite artist is. This is so easy and convenient. Pandora has to be one of my all time favorite applications."
43189,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"Pandora music your way you choice! I truly enjoy this app for music. I choose what I want to hear and when I want to hear it. I have the capability to set music stations that I like the way I like. I have stations to get me going stations for background and for falling to sleep. The commercials are not a deterrent for me there are less than the radio. Which by the way I never listen to now Pandora all the time."
43191,"Pandora",2017-09-07,1,"A decade behind!!! I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I have been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I would see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I have gotten a promotion gotten a raise I have even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that is it a new shinny page."
43195,"Pandora",2012-12-26,5,"Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire I love love love Pandora and have used it for a few years now!! You can not get much better than free but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1 especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now and not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5 6 or sometimes as long as every 8 10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free huh?"

43217,"Pandora",2013-08-29,1,"well it was good! This was a fantastic app until one day it decided to stop working. Nothing more than a blue Pandora screen now sad"
43218,"Pandora",2013-01-09,5,"Music I like!!!! Pandora is a great radio app.IMO much better than mobile Spotify!!Just type in a favorite artist or song and a stations will be created for you.As you rate the songs it will personalize the selections over time.I am very happy I installed this app.Best thing is you can put your device in standby and the music still plays while saving battery life.Sound quality is FANTASTIC!!! Enjoy.....JoeUpdate:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can not go back and play them you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on and a great song was skippednot by me!!! I still love the app!!tunein is better though"
43219,"Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"Pandora rocks...or pops...or jazzes...whatever you want! Pandora was recommended to me by a friend so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional get started guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!"
43221,"Pandora",2016-06-18,3,"I have some concerns Its cool and all just there is no search it only has a few songs I like it but it needs some more things to it. Spotify is way better!"
43229,"Pandora",2014-11-03,4,"Good free music app with lots of variety Not a bad free music app. You can select albums artists etc to listen to. Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play. You have no control over specific songs though. Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you are listening too. Sometimes it is great others can be disappointing. However if you want only the one album of specific song this does not work so well. If you do not like wha tis playing you are limited to how many songs you can skip. And there are a fair share of ad interruptions. The other downside is that it takes a bit ti shut down the app and are constantly sending update notifications and thus far I have not figured out a way to stop them.But regardless this is free and can still be great. I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I am cleaning exercising or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there are less interruptions here than on a live radio station. They have a good variety of music on it but seem limited to US artists so far mostly."
43232,"Pandora",2017-09-30,5,"Best music service company bar none I have had Pandora Music Service for a number of years and am a regular subscriber. I think Pandora is the best music service on the market. Music choice ease of use especially the quick mix option and the annual cost make it virtually unbeatable."
43236,"Pandora",2012-04-08,5,"Its Perfect! Pandora has an organized layout and also you can thumb down and up songs also pause and more. For Kindle Fire you can shut your screen off then power the screen on on a commercial video and come back to the next song!!"

43239,"Pandora",2017-01-02,3,"Some things ARE never ending. Although it is free it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music but then it shuts off to ask if you are still listening!!! Good music and sounds like a radio with commercials but stop asking if we are still listening someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."
43242,"Pandora",2016-06-09,5,"Music everywhere! I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials are not as bad as you find on the radio."

The best site it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. it is not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site youtube.com bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. it is called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."

There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs. Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them but there are not many. For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
43264,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Pilot of the Airwaves Pandora is the best effort yet to allow each of us to be our own disc jockey. Take an artist a song or a genre and use Pandora to build a total environment and system of sound. Simply sublime!"

Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart. Sometimes it is really bad. I have no problems with Radio Paradise. Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there. Most annoying since it is not December but March. It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars."

But when you have a problem with it it is impossible to get it fixed. My son gave me a gift card and it is not working. I have written so many times and on one will help me. The free version sucks ads so you really need to pay for it. I think if you buy it from Amazon it will be better than buying it from Pandora directly. Amazon takes care of their customers but Pandora does not. Next time I will go through Amazon so they will look after me!"

For example the ads can come up a lot or If I am on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio but get this Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I am not sure if it is just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on highI have unlimited data so it is not a problem for me. it is free so it is worth it but if you are thinking of getting Pandora OnePremium Membership that lets you skip more track and no ads then go to Spotify instead it is a lot better in my opinion."

43295,"Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora amazes me and I am a vinyl and radio junkie from way back. do not cheat yourself; try this one! Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most and it is commercial free if you pay the modest dollar 36.00 US or so per year. Although you cannot at this time request a specific song you will get commercial free tunes in any genre you choose. I can not recommend Pandora highly enough. If you are tired of normal radio try Pandora. you will listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love. it is almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go! Try it....I would be really surprised if you do not love it. You define your stations however you would like. Then shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."

Select any music set up multiple channels for your own person desires set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike. Its one of the easiest things we have ever had and so much nicer than radio. No commercials non stop music and just what you want to hear. You can not get better than that! I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio every day of the week."

43368,"Pandora",2012-07-07,1,"Excessive permissions and poor app performance made me remove it from my Kindle Fire! I thought it would be nice to listen to the radio when I was waiting for someone when I had a WIFI available. I did not realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I do not want to share that data with someone's server.Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle. Network communication full internet access and create Bluetooth connections Your personal information add or modify calendar events and send email to guests read contact data Storage modify delete internal storage contents Kindle calls read Kindle state and identity System tools Bluetooth administration change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping Network communication view network state view WIFI state System tools automatically set start at bootI just found the app to not work very well not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio.

It makes me think I do not need to buy cds anymore! When I want to hear one kind of music I choose that category but I usually enjoy the mix.

However after you use up all of your skips you can just change to a different station and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora One for a dollar 36 yearly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with no ads although in my opinion the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive however there is still a skip limit with Pandora One. that is why I use Milk Music. You pay less only dollar 4.00 per month and you will get unlimited Skips with no Ads. I think I am going to say with Milk Music."

Once that happens it is totally worth it because your linked to your own account no matter what gadget your using at the time. Go Pandora !"

43430,"Pandora",2013-03-07,5,"I love Pandora! I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I do not like so far is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I do not think that is right because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my stations from that account. If you have an account with Netflix be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I do not know."

LOVE LOVE LOVE! My children love it too!"
43481,"Pandora",2013-11-21,5,"The Doctor not really the Doctor just a nickname I think this is absolutely the BEST music app I have ever had! it is better than I Heart Radio by a landslide! Any station you can think of Pandora has it!! It is not like a real broadcast radio station but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits all that station plays is today's hits! If you do not have the paid version 4 dollars a month however it has some ads. Oh and another thing. You will get a lot ofemails telling you what songs you like they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons one is Like one is Dislike automatically skips song skip and pause and what new songs are for the season. I like the emails however even if you hate emails. Well I do not have the paid version and I think it is amazing! Seriously get the app! No station limit no anything but songs of your choice and a couple ads."

43507,"Pandora",2017-05-04,5,"The Best This is the most wonderful music channel ever. I listen at home on an internet radio on the computer and especially in the car with a smart phone hookup. I have established an extensive playlist of the most beautiful music at least to me I could ever imagine. There is a cost outside of a wifi connection but to me it is worth every penny."
43508,"Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"I enjoy it. I like how it can pick the music that I love to listen to."
43512,"Pandora",2016-03-01,5,"Great radio app By clicking on one or two artists I have all my favorite music. I can set the app to play while I go to sleep and to wake me up again the next morning. I am watching much less TV now that I have my favorite music at my fingertips!"

43517,"Pandora",2015-09-01,5,"the mobile app works great and functions almost exactly like the mobile and desktop ...

43524,"Pandora",2015-01-28,5,"Love the Pandora app I really like this app. I have a Pandora account and now that I have my Kindle Fire I tend to listen to Pandora much more than I used to. I especially like to listen to my selected music tastes while working on a project or just reading on my Kindle. I find it very relaxing. This is one free app that I get a lot of use out of and I just love it."
43525,"Pandora",2016-02-16,5,"Great music app I have iheartradio on my phone but I prefer Pandora. I love being able to make new stations based on artist genre or even song. We listen to Pandora on our Roku most every day. Now if we could all just agree on what station to put on!"

43539,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"Great muaic all the time. Love Pandora. I can listen to anything I want to and mix it up. Some days I listen to piano and classical. Other days I listen to pop or retro plus many more stations."

43550,"Pandora",2016-04-10,2,"Pandora does not play on my device Right now it is stuck on buffering whenever I open the app. I tried reinstalling but that did not work either. Please fix this or let me know what I can do. Thanks."
43554,"Pandora",2015-04-18,3,"Okay lack of selection and limited skipping makes this not very useful For my listening genres electronic new age/relaxation/concentration the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections it was a no brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss for which I will be eternally grateful : ."
43555,"Pandora",2014-01-25,2,"Not worth getting I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160 live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit but does not make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I do not suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
43556,"Pandora",2013-09-22,4,"Great way to hear new music! I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
43557,"Pandora",2015-12-22,3,"Too many commercials. While Pandora is nice the free version plays a hundred times more ads than Spotify. Spotify also offers full minute commercials and then plays for half an hour. I do like how I can filter out explicit content which is something I cannot do on Spotify."
43560,"Pandora",2013-05-27,5,"I seriously love this When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I am branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I would never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and did not know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there is nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. happy"
43561,"Pandora",2017-11-11,5,"Wonderful App Love getting my music on all devices."
43563,"Pandora",2017-07-01,5,"Great app any time Good to have on my kindle fire for quick music"
43571,"Pandora",2014-06-14,3,"Music player I installed the app on my pc phone and tablet at the same time. I checked to see if they were working by playing them. No way to turn the app off you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing. I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!! Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices. A good little fix would be a stop button on the App. Oh by the way I am a paying customer!"
43572,"Pandora",2014-07-12,4,"Almost 5 stars but my station gets invaded frequently with offensive music I love Pandora and listen to it all the time on my computer my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great and I usually but not always get music I enjoy.That said Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan Irish piano riffs and some beautiful moving classical music. But at least once a day my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the at number dollar and ?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious and mildly annoyed. And yeah it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
43574,"Pandora",2014-02-01,4,"I play this on my cell ph. while I am running and/or jumping rope.I love the music of course..but THOSE FREQUENT ADVS. are a pain.I have to stop running..click the corner X and then it takes some time for the song to continue...sometimes I have to close the app. then re openI know it is FREE so I do understand.The frequency of advs. DOES make me think about subscribing for dollar 4/monthly if that means NO ADVS. EVER!But the variety of music is impressive and again it is FREE!"
43576,"Pandora",2017-05-09,5,"great I like this app cause it helps me sleep and i enjoy listing to the music that they provide me."
43577,"Pandora",2017-09-16,5,"Five Stars I love Pandora and I wish I would have heard about it years ago."
43579,"Pandora",2011-10-28,5,"Impressed me to tears happy I am happy now. Now that Pandora's free membership comes with unlimited playback I want Pandora everywhere and thanks to this Pandora is on my XOOM now.Pandora is elegant and flawless on Honeycomb. The screen is less cluttered than the PC version with nothing but the album cover the thumbs up/down icons an 'info' button that opens up artist and song info screens and the playback controls. I like that option to blank the screen while layback continues. And Pandora keeps playing while other apps are in use tried it with the browser and a couple of games.The Android settings menu allows you to tweak a few parameters: Play quality high/normal Auto screen lock on/off Auto shutdown in low memory situations Bluetooth on/offit is perfection with some ads popping up. >> Brush your teeth it is the law! <<"
43584,"Pandora",2012-12-06,3,"Used to be very good! Not sure what has happened to Pandora but the annoying way the ads are and the amount are terrible. I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone. I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora Slacker and iheartradio. I have to say I am not jealous anymore. This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed: 1. Slacker 2. iheartradio 3. Pandora Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."
43585,"Pandora",2016-04-29,5,"I love love I love love love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes when I workout cook clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone tv iPad etc."

43587,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"music music music I love Pandora. It plays in the background while I do other things on my laptop or my Kindle.

I love the Big Band New Orleans Jazz Boogie Woogie 40's 50's as well as classical classic Christmas was WONDERFUL also old countryPatsy Cline and others. Pleasestay as great as you are. I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change."

43600,"Pandora",2012-11-07,5,"Does what I have always wanted to do with my music This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens. It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."

I have several favorite stations and switch them to match my mood. One thing I really like is I can set a timer to turn it off whenever I want to use it to serenade me before I go to sleep. I can also wake to music if I so choose. I also use it on my computer but not as often as I do on my phone."

I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up.

Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists in addition to the artists of your choice to play. There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora. If a song comes on you do not like just hit skip and it will never be played again. I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much especially the price free!!"

43808,"Pandora",2013-05-02,5,"I love being able to listen to the kind of music I like I love Pandora. It is very nice being able to listen to only music that you like. I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really do not plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like. By that I mean that if you put an artist on Pandora you may only have a small number of that artist's songs available. Therefore you may have to listen to 5 or 10 songs by that artist over and over."
43810,"Pandora",2017-06-13,5,"Five Stars Good Apt"
43814,"Pandora",2017-10-13,5,"Five Stars Very good app"
43816,"Pandora",2015-01-01,2,"Pandora often over promises and under delivers. Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works. If you want something more eclectic not so hot. Or perhaps they are targeting people under 40 with only lip service to older demographics. The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format. there is just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll. Of course you can skip the Dean Martin song but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow you exceed your skip quotient with the free version. Basically even with contemporary music I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters. I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with stations I try to construct so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora. Do have to say that their Rockin Holidays Radio station pretty much delivered on its promise so there is someone in programming that gets it. Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."

I have tried other music app as well but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they have made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they are released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some your own selections of songs you will love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. there is no way you will be disappointed with it."

Now I do not listen to Pandora as much as I used to and that makes me upset. If I had unlimited free music like I used to I would give it 5 stars.

The reason I am giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that is why its amazing but if you do not like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that is not bad but you have limited skips and every time you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app."

44030,"Pandora",2014-11-29,4,"Pretty Cool Stuff. But... Pandora is amazing but sometimes the person your interested in in music of course the he/she s music wanders off somewhere else. Say for instance you wanna hear Taylor Swift after a while it goes to lets say the band Maroon 5. BUT I would suggest it. it is free anyway."
44032,"Pandora",2016-07-17,5,"Great variety! I love listening to the variety of old and new songs with very few commercials. what is especially great about Pandora is that I can choose the kind of music I like!"
44036,"Pandora",2017-05-25,5,"Five Stars Easy listening"
44039,"Pandora",2017-08-30,5,"Love love Love love love pandora. I can never get enough of every kind of music I love. In the house on a walk and while I am mowing the lawn. it is always easy to get."
44040,"Pandora",2017-06-05,5,"Five Stars Very good product i use it often."
44047,"Pandora",2017-07-25,5,"Awesome! Awesome!"
44050,"Pandora",2014-01-30,5,"Best app. so far! it is free! I do not mind the commercials as long as it remains free! Having my favorite artists so available is awesome. Very easy to use too."
44051,"Pandora",2014-03-17,5,"Music Player for Kindles As long as you have access to the Internet you will have access to Pandora.com which has a large database of available tunes. You can decide which genre you want and adjust it to play only what you want to hear. It will however make suggestions based upon your preferences. it is almost like owning your own radio station."
44052,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"How can you not love this? How can you not love Pandora? It is so easy to use and it seems to play what you want to hear when you need to hear it. I have pandora on my computer iPhone TV and at work. Sometimes I want to hear a mix of my saved stations and other times I just want to hear one. Pandora makes all this easy! Now there are ads and I need to click on Still Listening every so often but its free and I am ok with that."
44054,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Pandora is a great service. The varied number of songs available in ... Pandora is a great service. The varied number of songs available in any genre that you can name is mind boggling. I could never afford to buy all that music but yet I can listen to it at any tine. Great stuff!"
44055,"Pandora",2013-05-23,5,"Though I do There is no point of buying music with Pandora SoundCloud etc. I am a DJ/VJ.Subscriber to White Label Virtual DJ Premium ASCAP and was a subscriber to 3 other labels.The industry should and is going down in CD sales with Pandora Slacker MusicTube etc. and alternativesto.net but it is the era of making money in other ways like product placement and adds.There is really no point to buying what we use to buy with advertisements on Pandora etc. and Office Starter for example. And the industry is going that way BTW.Pandora is worth it. dollar 36 for 1 year. Free if you want to take more advertisements.XM I can get 6 months for dollar 25.Everything is going open source. And the advertisements are getting heavy.For all relating to Open Source/ie free/ the best website to figure this out is alternativesto.net"
44060,"Pandora",2016-11-30,3,"no more multiple streams when did they only allow one person to listen at a time?? used to like to have me and the wife in separate rooms listing"
44066,"Pandora",2015-11-23,5,"Love it! Great selection of music along with my favorites. Now I can not live without my Pandora!"

44094,"Pandora",2014-12-10,5,"Seems like I spend a lot of time now trying to ... Just wish there were fewer ads as in the past when I had Pandora years ago. Seems like I spend a lot of time now trying to avoid them or tuning out. Will not pay that much to be AD FREE. Sorry will use CD's or something else instead before I pay for ad free service."
44098,"Pandora",2014-01-29,5,"Almost Perfect I absolutely love this app. After getting your favorite groups and songs into and as playlists start telling it which songs you like and do not. As the Alger rhythm goes along the playlists start to become just about right on target for what you want. Only throwing in the odd song that makes no sense. Most definitely worth it."
44099,"Pandora",2012-12-28,5,"Awesome radio.... Pandora is a great media outlet when I want to listen to a variety of music while working online or studying for my classes. It gives me an outlet of all types of music from Classical to Modern Country Old Rock and Pop that I have listened to all my life. Type in an artist's name and a radio station will pop up with this artist's songs with an addition of songs similar to the type of music presented. Love it Love it..."

44120,"Pandora",2014-09-08,4,"Get Pandora finished: date and more variety from artist. and I liked it a lot but starting to be repetitious to a point of looping that I know what will play next. Also a suggestion in the words of song below the song writer s are listed the year of that song's creation would be perfect and more complete pleez work on that.!!"
44121,"Pandora",2015-10-07,5,"Excellent interface across platforms. Love this streaming app! The algorithm lets you hear new music to expand and exlore different tastes and genres. Excellent interface and smooth transition between different platforms. Great app for music!"
44127,"Pandora",2014-12-29,4,"I love my Pandora I have been using Pandora for free for 3 years and I love it. My only complaint is that lately the advertisements are becoming more frequent and if you have a station set for a long time songs start to repeat a lot. To fix that just delete the station and make a new one."
44136,"Pandora",2015-11-16,5,"Pandora Rocks The Planet tick .... TOCK Pandora makes Gracenote look like Chump Change Full Spectrum Broad Beam and the Music is not so bad either With 360 of pulse pounding music it is sure to even wake up a MUMMY or TWO so with a 1 being the lowest and a 10 being the highest remark I grade Pandora a 999 ZILLION PERCENT excellence award SO A BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS AT PANDORA Sincerely John Adam Rendo'n >>"
44139,"Pandora",2017-10-12,5,"Five Stars Love it!"
44140,"Pandora",2012-04-01,5,"Reliable good interface and good quality Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned I have nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.Connection has been good with my T Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I have experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network location and signal strengthThe interface is very user friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar thumbs up thumbs down pause stations and next. On the top right corner there is an i which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers highs and lows are still distinct. it is not the best but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."
44142,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"you can make your stations your own! We like that we can make the channels our own by rating them. We use it on the TV PC and Amazon Echo. Thumbs up that you like it or thumbs down and it never plays it again. We think it is great!"
44150,"Pandora",2011-11-17,4,"Good Internet Radio App Recommended This is one of the most used apps on my Android phone and tablet providing streaming music to my device. The app allows you to make channels based on your music preferences but not necessarily letting pick individual songs. This is a free app so there are ads showing up on the screen but they are not too intrusive.This works well for me where there is good wifi or 3G service.Recommended!CFH"
44151,"Pandora",2017-07-31,5,"Five Stars I love being able to pick my own music. Pandora is the best"
44153,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Great selections Regardless of the artist or bands the variety is superior to turning on the radio."
44154,"Pandora",2013-12-27,5,"Amazing! At the touch of one's fingers you have your own personal music station for your favorite genre of music. You can save the songs you have listened to and even purchase them right off of Amazon's music hub. So awesome. This is a must for music lovers."
44155,"Pandora",2014-10-04,5,"Love sleep timer I enjoy peaceful music as a trigger for sleep so I entered Jim brick man which gives me a channel of piano music. I especially like the sleep timer I can set for an hour of music"

44174,"Pandora",2012-01-16,5,"Would be five stars but for one feature Updated:loses a star! Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web. This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already do not like Pandora for whatever reason you are not going to like the app obviously.Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle. Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the QuickMix station list especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora my Kindle Fire would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser. Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while but that got fixed too and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it so it has earned two more stars! Way to go it is about time!"
44176,"Pandora",2017-07-28,5,"Five Stars Great music at no cost."
44178,"Pandora",2016-12-28,5,"Five Stars The choice of music is unlimited and easy to listen to on the computer tablet or other internet medium."
44180,"Pandora",2012-08-29,4,"Pandora This is a great application made for those that already use Pandora radio. It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set up so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.Problems you will find if you use the free version of Pandora: The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open. You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station where music comes from such as artists songs e.g. EDIT It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music. You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment. This is now possible. They have fixed it and made the application even better.My qualms with the application but it is good nonetheless."
44181,"Pandora",2014-08-12,3,"once upon a time. .. This app used to be good but lately its been pretty annoying; running in the background eating up my data plan ehrn I thought it was shut down. Plays the same 5 songs in a row on my phone but when I listen yo the same station on my pc now all these different better songs play. I do not mind the commercials but if I can not get it to shut off when I close the app without the need to force close I might have to let it go."
44186,"Pandora",2016-11-18,5,"love music at my fingers.. love it"

44203,"Pandora",2013-01-02,5,"I am listening to pandora right now! I love having this app on my kindle. It gives me the opportunity to listen to gospel music and worship God while I have got my hands busy. And I tend to listen to classical music with my headphones on as I read the Bible and other books! I use my Kindle as a tool to better myself so I like the fact that Pandora is an online radio station that I can customize my own channel with out loading my computer with lots of memory!"
44204,"Pandora",2016-02-06,5,"Love Pandora Listen to this on a regular basis. it is not perfect but can not be beat for the price free. A couple of 10 second commercials every hour are not a problem for me."
44205,"Pandora",2016-12-20,4,"Four Stars I only wish there were not commercials but I understand that to get this free you need them"
44212,"Pandora",2017-05-03,5,"LOVE IT!! I absolutely love Pandora! It allows me to hear what I want to hear when I want to hear it without commercials or other interruptions!"

44223,"Pandora",2016-04-17,3,"Not the worst music player but... Regardless of if my headphones work of not and regardless of my internet the music cuts out and will skip at random although the ads work just fine. However the selection of music is very nice and varied."
44225,"Pandora",2017-07-20,5,"Five Stars I love the app"
44233,"Pandora",2013-06-10,5,"The greatest! Finally I can listen to the kind of music I really like! I am just using the free app so have to put up with commercials but that is not a big deal. The only 'negative' and this could be because I do not have the right settings is that it only plays for about an hour before it shuts down and has to be manually restarted.I will recommend Pandora to all my friends."
44235,"Pandora",2015-08-18,5,"bug? I have used this app for years and I have always loved it! For some reason this app has not worked this past week. Songs will attempt to load and then a commercial will come on. I can not get any music to play. what is the issue?"
44241,"Pandora",2013-02-10,5,"Fantastic! Anytime I can listen to music while I am doing something is fabulous. Now I have the choice of my phone or my kindle! My computer speakers do not work so now that I have this app I can take the music from room to room and not have to mess with turning it off on my phone or turn it down and then up again or off and on on my phone. Makes life so much simpler."
44242,"Pandora",2017-08-13,5,"Five Stars I LOVE PANDORA....."
44250,"Pandora",2014-12-30,2,"it is now mostly ads with the occasional tune that does not crash. I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says Pandora can not find any more music try changing channels on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it is recently become totally unusable as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it is it is same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."

Now that the market is flooded with internet music providers Pandora is still tops. Go Pandora. Even if I have to download an app for my digital manhood I still give them 5stars."
44276,"Pandora",2013-04-07,3,"Generally Fair I like Pandora because of there song veriety but the 3 stars is because1. Other songs show up more than the radio station Songs which forces me to skip then when my skips run out and a horrible song comes on I have to go to another station and listen to another station and deal with it again2. I have read reviews of Pandora and most songs are not complete only one song occurred that was itI am mostly taking the song issue more than the complete songsPandora stop picking your noses and fix these problems so we could keep listening and give you guys positive reviews its more simple than you think to do it I would be more than happy to delete and start listening to slacker etc"

44351,"Pandora",2014-01-28,5,"Best music radio! I love Pandora. I appreciate that there are no commercials or over the top DJs spouting off about things nobody wants to hear. Pandora is just music. I have a station for every possible mood: from Slipknot to Sting to Yoga Radio. it is as versatile as I am. The ability to create stations by band song or genre. I like having the option of thumbs down when I do not want a particular song to be part of my listening experience. The variety is fantastic."

This app is perfect for when you do not have a lot of tunes stored on your device or you want to listen to something you do not have. it is a great way to discover new music based on what you already enjoy. The suggestions make sense and I am very happy to have this. Being an avid music listener I tend to get bored of what I have easily. Pandora has helped me find some of my new favorite artists and discover old ones I have never heard of before. Great App!"

44399,"Pandora",2013-06-07,5,"Joe reviews another one This is the best music app as far as radio is considered. There are very little adds and you can listen to anything you like. Lets say you like Queen The Beatles or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox Twiztid Cypress Hill and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles expect to get Beach Boys the Byrds Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear Boston Adam and the ants Electric Light Orchestra and more great 70 80's bands."
44400,"Pandora",2017-07-21,4,"Like more options Pandora is great but it tends to repeat songs. It would be nice to have the opportunity to go through and select other songs."
44403,"Pandora",2015-08-28,1,"worst. a zero if i could write it. They do not seem to take into account what i like and do not like. Also there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example dinner with ladies of song but there is not a male version. the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement. Stay away and go to Songza or another site."

Did you also know that if the people that believed the stupid retarted impatient people who rated this app badly because of the adds d not possess this virtue? well its true. the adds are not that long you can listen to your favorite music and discover different music and guess what... its all free! the adds are fine they are not that horrible they last like 1 minute to at least 20 seconds. and if you run out of skips just make a new channel that is basically the station you ran out of skips for. please listen to me and use your common sense. This is why I rated Pandora five stars. Sorry for the long post."

44541,"Pandora",2017-07-22,2,"Pandora needs to change limited skip bs Its okay. Used to pay for it. Finally stopped paying for it. Supposedly they offer unlimited skips. Which they said they had before. They still probably do not. Thwy let you skip 5 songs and say sorry we know you are sucker and paid for this but we are not lerting you hear just what you want. Here are a few songs that are free that suck listen to them. Oh you made a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you will hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha."
44547,"Pandora",2014-07-24,5,"Wonderful...Love it!!! Easy to work with and the variety of music is great. I join the subscription for no interruption or ads so it is great."
44550,"Pandora",2012-07-22,5,"Love It! Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before but not that many and far less than local radio and you can pay to have none at all. You can get a great variety by entering you favorite artist then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations. And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo I have had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said but it does happen on occasion. I also play it on my home computer. Its free and I love it."

I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.FYI The pop up Advertisements are there Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire. It is a nice way listen to music when you are connected to wifi."
44593,"Pandora",2016-12-22,5,"amazon Tap Alexa is amazing and so much fun. She can answer almost anything with a clear and concise comment. I I love Pandora Media. It is one of only a few stations that plays Oldies but Goodies music for us senior citizens."

44636,"Pandora",2013-07-15,4,"Good product could use a few less ads I undersand that ads are what makes it free which is why it is still a four star but a new add every time you skip or change station as well as every three or four songs seems a little much. Interface is pretty good. If you add enough variety the stations do an decent job of fitting your tastes. Eats up data if you are not on a wifi network but that is to be expected."
44644,"Pandora",2013-08-21,3,"Love Pandora but... Of course Pandora is great but after one song plays I have to unlock my phone and wait for the next song to load or rather a commercial and then the next song. Kind of inconvenient. And many more commercials than the regular version of Pandora. I do not mind listening to an occasional commercial now and then but literally every other song is a bit much."

44706,"Pandora",2014-04-28,1,"Horrible Pandora is the most anti consumer anti artist radio service the world has ever known. Here are a few highlights you can expect with your Pandora player:1. very few songs played over and over and over and over again2. only run the player on one device at a time3. extremely expensive for what you get spend the dollar 36 a year on 36 single downloads and you will have more variety and better quality.do not USE PANDORA!"
44713,"Pandora",2013-10-14,5,"Music to go. Pandora creates stations of music similar to any artist you submit. Peter Gabriel for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting. This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet. It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials."
44715,"Pandora",2014-06-06,3,"I am not to pleased. When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it it worked I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."

It also exposes me to music that I have never heard before which turns me on to musicians and bands that I would not ordinary hear that I end up liking. It provides an avenue that I can somewhat steer towards the music that appeals to me. I listen to Pandora on a daily basis and have for a few years now. 5 thumbs up for Pandora! Thanks!"

Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive ex. gives suggestions for different stations singers etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"
44806,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"Music...... ........that you have no control over. If you like Rock Country Electronica Pop etc you pick the category and the songs begin to play. You cannot tell the app what songs you would like to hear. In other words this works just like radio stations that plays genres of music that you like. You may not like the song that is currently playing so you can switch to another station or just wait for the song to end and hope the next tune is something you like."

This is a very good app. I can listen to ridiculous music like the Goofy Goober Song to real music you would hear on the radio to music from the Harry Potter movies! The only problem is if I use it while playing Minecraft my Kindle either shuts down or glitches badly."
44827,"Pandora",2014-12-29,5," THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES Absolutely awesome I lke almost all generes of music but the blues are my favorite. Recently I heard of this site from my son I am like a kid with a new toy. Thank you so much for having set this up for those that have a common love of music. Keep the great work Mark D. NY..."
44832,"Pandora",2015-04-09,5,"... music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!! So many music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!!"
44839,"Pandora",2016-12-11,5,"Love Pandora! Love Pandora!! Can listen to my music on any device and in even in my car or on TV with DirectTV!"
44847,"Pandora",2014-02-28,4,"Great for the Most Part You can not complain about the price but I would like it so much better if you did not choose other artists for me or if you would at least allow me to weed them out. The best I can do is drop 1 song at a time and that just is not adequate. Most of the music you offer however is really great so I gave you the 4 stars.Thank you."
44854,"Pandora",2015-06-12,1,"Pandora could not fix the problem! Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone. I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working. I contacted them and they are unable to figure out what is wrong. I am cancelling my service and going with another provider."
44864,"Pandora",2015-09-08,5,"Amazing This app is so amazing I would recommend it to everyone free music and it is just amazing."

44895,"Pandora",2014-12-07,3,"grrrr why does it do this????!!!!!! I love Pandora but... it keeps playing songs that do not even relate to me station I am listening to! So I am listening to Imagine Dragons raised and I hear Taylor Swift or Paul Cardall!!!! And it only lets me skip songs 5 6 Times an hour on each station!!! This is why I you Pandora a 3 5!"
44897,"Pandora",2012-12-26,4,"comes across songs/artist I have never heard of and I end up enjoying I like that it lets me add several artists to one station so that it gets a better idea of what to suggest. I do not like that in the beginning while you are teaching it what you like you can only fast forward so many times. And even though you can not go back and listen to a specific artist/album like in Spotify it is suggestions are still much much better. So if I want something possible new mixed in with what I like I use Pandora."
44901,"Pandora",2017-05-29,4,"Four Stars keeps me company and I enjoy their library of entertainjment"
44906,"Pandora",2014-12-03,5,"Work great on Blackberry Passport Great app for fantastic music!!"

44909,"Pandora",2014-10-11,5,"The best option by far Pandora has the best stations I have heard so far and their website is wonderful to navigate. You can collect albums and songs from your favorites and they even have stations that are created through your favorite song or artist. I have Pandora on Roku and enjoy it through my television computer and Kindle. I love the music. Music choices seem endless and if you want commercial free and ad free music the subscription price is amazingly low."
44911,"Pandora",2015-05-28,2,"ADS I am sorry but way too many adds.I just can not use it anymore.so I use spotify.I am actually listening to it while I review.and I can tell you there where no ads for a whopping 15 minutes.compared to Pandora that is such a big difference."
44913,"Pandora",2015-12-23,1,"horrible When I get on I hit register for free then I do what it tell me what to do then I hit sign in then it tells me. and number 34;Thank you for your interest but unfortunately Pandora can not get to you"
44915,"Pandora",2013-12-10,5,"YOU NEED PANDORA!!! Hey you yes you! listen up! PANDORA IS A MUST HAVE. I literally live on Pandora. I play it no matter what I am doing it is on. You can personalize your stations by clicking the thumbs up. You can create stations by genre of music and the artist. For example my favorite is Carrie Underwood radio. For any of those musics lover's out there; Get Pandora Now!!! It is amazing. I cant even say anything bad about it!!"

I use it all the time like right now I am listening to over the rainbow love the song I recommend that you get this app and it is free so if you do not like it you will not waste your coins or money. I recommend it to music fans. Pick any genera any song and it is there. If you do not believe me try it for yourself. ITS FREE!!!!!!!!"
44937,"Pandora",2015-08-07,4,"The Best For This Classical Music Lover I have tried most of the streaming music apps and this one works best for me and my preference for classical music. My only complaint would be that it tends the treat new age and classical music as the same. They are very different."
44942,"Pandora",2016-01-22,1,"not working Sometimes it will only play a few songs then stops then wont play none and sometimes it will not play at all ...I love Pandora its my favorite but idk why its not working on here ."

44944,"Pandora",2017-01-20,5,"Padora on BlackBerry Passport great sound Works very well. Nice in a private setting with friends with no interrupted moments. Best when in the car and there is a really limited choice of music stations."
44945,"Pandora",2012-11-30,2,"pandora used to be awesome!!! I listen to Pandora constantly while on my kindle fire. up until a few weeks ago I would have definitely given this app 5 stars. but lately it gets stuck every few songs almost every time an ad comes up. I have to keep exiting and opening it up again just to hear a few more songs before it gets stuck again. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but that did not do any good. Pandora still seems to be running great on my Pc though. weird. please fix this problem because it is very annoying!"
44948,"Pandora",2013-04-08,5,"Makes a noisy workplace less distracting I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me. Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi."
44950,"Pandora",2017-04-29,5,"Five Stars great bedtime music...fall asleep great... many thanks..never relized 50's music was so bad !"

44969,"Pandora",2013-06-04,5,"Its great for Music Lovers Its a really great app for music. You can listen to different types of music pop country ect. And if you do not like a song you are listening to: do not worry. You can tap a next button which takes you to a different song. But beware! there is only 6 times in an hour you can do this. Its free and you get to listen to a bunch of music. If you want to go free on music just get the app and you get to listen to free music. Enjoy!"

44999,"Pandora",2012-01-01,5,"Excellent performance on the Kindle Fire I use the Pandora app daily and have been able to find whatever music genre I need to fit my mood or act as appropriate background music while reading. Sound quality is excellent on the Fire and the app has been almost glitch free. One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you are listening to if you like what you are hearing and want to buy it. Pandora provides amazing entertainment value on the Kindle Fire and in my opinion has something to offer any user."
45001,"Pandora",2017-11-06,5,"Love the old stuff Outstanding. I am an old seasoned senior that enjoys 50s. Rock and. Roll and 50s. Oldies. Melodys. I am in seventh heaven"

45035,"Pandora",2012-12-10,3,"The music is great the commercials are a pain I guess that is the point of free versus subscription service but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer based commercials now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating to say the least."
45039,"Pandora",2013-07-15,5,"Music.... I have a couple of music downloads and I perfer Pandora. Free version still will not let you forward past songs as much as you would like..."
45041,"Pandora",2014-07-14,5,"la la la!!! I am always listening to music at hhome so this is perfect because I do not have to buy any songs. or listen to the same songs over and over. So this is great because it has a huge variety of music!!! I recommend the: Today's hits radio Dubstep radio Jasmine Thompson radio "
45044,"Pandora",2014-01-19,3,"did not get what I was expecting The product information indicated it was a 10 pack; 20 batteries but I only received a 5 pack 10 batteries. it is too much trouble to complain so I just learned a lesson and will not order this item again."
45046,"Pandora",2013-09-20,5,"Music Music Pandora is a lot of fun. I love the fact that you can personalize the music you listen to by adding in an artist of your choice. However I do have one complaint. The only thing I do not like is that sometimes you get music that should not even be categorized next to a genre. If I type in Disturbed I do not want Britney Spears. Period."
45051,"Pandora",2017-09-12,5,"Great music app No need to download music when you have Pandora! It has so many choices at a single touch!"

45059,"Pandora",2013-09-10,5,"Great Music Service Pandora has successfully made an app that oust all the other music/radio to shame. Only the quick advertisements take away from what is fluid and complety personal listening experience. On top of that Pandora continues to before better and better updates keeping the music fresh and the features applicable to what you look for on the app. Overall Pandora dwarfs all other radio apps."
45062,"Pandora",2016-08-24,1,"Not worth ad free cost for very limited repertoire in CHORALE. Lynn Music superior. Very limited repertoire in each category of music especially CHORALE. SNEAKY increase in price from dollar 3.99 to dollar 4.99 per month for ad free listening."
45063,"Pandora",2017-01-30,5,"Five Stars Hands down the greatest music app to date..... Thanks pandora!!!!"
45067,"Pandora",2016-02-02,5,"The best! I dropped Sirius because their music is 70 years old! They are so out of touch their Chill station is all vocals! If I create an instrumental station on Pandora I will not hear a lyric for hours."
45068,"Pandora",2012-08-02,4,"I am in love BUT Ok I am 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me. Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire. I love it. I think it is so neat how you make a album type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist. And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again. It remembers. The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder. The way it is not you get to hear those you love but others too and might not like everything playing. Sometimes I do not want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country rap techno etc. I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."
45071,"Pandora",2017-10-17,5,"The only problem is that the network losses station and ... The only problem is that the network losses station and signal a lot in the north east part of Philadelphia"
45072,"Pandora",2014-05-28,5,"cool app I really like this app and it is nice because if the device turns off you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"

45091,"Pandora",2013-01-29,5,"Love this service! Wherever you use Pandora you gotta use it! I do not pay for the service so I have to suffer through the ads. But what it has done is suggest several different musicians to me that I would never have thought of. I then promptly go to Amazon and buy the CD after listening to a few track samples of course. It is a great way to find out what is out there!"

45130,"Pandora",2012-05-21,5,"Pandora Rocks! Because I have never been able to stick with just one type of music to enjoy Pandora is perfect for me. The site lets me select all the different types of music/artists together in one place for my listening pleasure without my having to do anything but rate the music as it is played. I tell Pandora who I like and they find music for my listening pleasure. Sometimes I use Pandora on my computer with headphones and sometimes I just listen over my HTC."

45154,"Pandora",2013-07-13,5,"Efficient control over what you listen to What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre set channel. You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy. Lots of programs can play one group over and over. Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."

45171,"Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"My third most used App. I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data and I use it all the time. I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up. One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files. Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.If you are using Green Power you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes."
45176,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"song options and lists I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back toThe songs that you just listened to. Also I do not like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift Lorde and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"

45211,"Pandora",2011-10-28,2,"Great product when it starts on first time.... I have a Nexus S Sprint and it usually takes 4 5 times for Pandora to finally open and let me play a song. Usually it gets stuck at a screen with Pandora title on a blue background screen but nothing else. I have to exit out and try cycling thru the startup process several times before it lets me get to the point where I can play music. I do not use Pandora on my phone much because of this bug and it drives me crazy because I love Pandora on my computer."
45216,"Pandora",2017-02-02,4,"Four Stars has introduced me to several great bands that I might have never heard of otherwise"

45222,"Pandora",2014-02-11,5,"music is the best this is a great app. I love that I can find classical music and jazz and all the genres I could ever want. I am using it now while typing this reviews."
45223,"Pandora",2015-07-18,3,"Pretty good could be better. I will keep using it. The ads and not letting you skip more than a couple songs are really irritating. Especially when you cant add a specific song. I will listen to it because it is free. Will not pay for the supposed add free version. That is why you purchase the music and put in a CD."
45226,"Pandora",2017-09-19,5,"Five Stars I love the variety of music with minimal commercials!"
45227,"Pandora",2013-08-10,5,"LOVE THIS! I love Pandora! I have set up over a dozen personalized stations . I can hear whatever music I am in the mood for from classical to Supertramp to Sade to Fun. and whatever similar artists and songs that Pandora pulls. The thumbs up and thumbs down I can give each selection helps to tweak each station even further."
45228,"Pandora",2015-08-15,4,"what is up? Love the app. Recently there was an update to kindle and since a lot of issues. At least there is music playing again. But now my kindle keeps deleting the app. I have to re download almost daily."
45230,"Pandora",2013-11-27,3,"do not update!!! i liked Pandora before a lot but when I updated it it started freezing 4 or more times in one song but also when I went into it the screen was blue while It was playing a song it just said Pandora with all the dots around it. I shut down my kindle and it did not work so I am not able to like dislike or skip a song"

45242,"Pandora",2014-12-28,2,"THIS SUCKS!!!!! I am sorry but I recommend iheartradio. It is so much better. Pandora always freezes when I want to hear a song advertisements pop up and end clicking that instead of a thumps up or down. iheartradio is simple and easy. But then again it is not my choice"
45245,"Pandora",2016-10-15,5,"Five Stars Very pleased with the music choices available."

45294,"Pandora",2012-12-06,4,"Great thanks I really like Pandora but it does not do the one thing that MySpace does let you create your own playlists of just the songs you like as well as allowing you to choose a radio station. Sometimes I just want to listen to my own playlist."
45299,"Pandora",2014-02-03,3,"Love it but... I Absolutely adore Pandora and use it all the time for my music. The only thing that is wrong is I would very much like to use the new alarm clock feature where it starts playing music when you need to get or ect. I have only got it to work the first time I used it. After that it will not turn on. Will give five stars when this is fixed."

When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music."

45489,"Pandora",2012-01-12,5,"can not understand. I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wifi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."

I do not buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or did not know who did them."

45568,"Pandora",2014-06-18,5,"This app is great!!! Great app. I can listen to a variety of music similar to one of my favorite bands. I also added other favorite bands for a fantastic mix of music. Have been finding bands I like that I have never heard of too."

45573,"Pandora",2012-11-06,5,"What else is there to say? Pandora is fantastic This delivers music with very little ads. But music that YOU pick you like and you might not yet know but may grow to love. it is free content for the cost of listen to an ad or two every five or six songs and REALLY free if you use it over wifi and not on your limited data plan smart phone. So much fun!"

45612,"Pandora",2014-06-10,5,"Great Music Choices I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I am at work. there is such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste. The songs play more clearly than my radio in work which tends to fade in and out because of being in a high office building. I would recommend this application to people of all ages."
45617,"Pandora",2013-09-19,5,"can not complain about free music Best radio app. It has lots of nice genres songs artist you name it it has it! I barely get any ads on my Kindle and even if there were it was short. But I do not mind having the ads if I know I will get some nice free songs to listen to."
45624,"Pandora",2012-10-12,5,"music discovery Pandora has been my number one app since my first smart phone. I have discovered so much new music with this service. I can listen on my computer on my Roku on my phone and on my Kindle Fire HD. I have been a Pandora One subscriber for the last two years and it is the best dollar 30 I spend each year."
45627,"Pandora",2012-04-14,3,"needs better songs It really needs better songs the one they put on know are bad and old you hear if about a billion songs they never put on the songs that are new like rumor has it or boyfriend or one direction or anything new you will probably heat songs from more then 5 or 6 years ago but some songs might be ok. So I would so its a ok app!!!"
45630,"Pandora",2017-09-07,5,"Car tunes Need tunes for my car and Pandora provides. Even with only a free account I can get all the music I want. Occasional ads are not so frequent that it bugs me."

I do not want to pay to upgrade so I am stuck. that is the bad news the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps"

45648,"Pandora",2012-09-19,2,"WHY THE CHANGE??? I have been a Pandora fan for quite a while and I absolutely hats their new format. That is why I have given it a 2 star rating.

45654,"Pandora",2014-02-17,1,"not available in this country? I read a lot of the reviews for Pandora and thought I finally found the music app made just for me. it looked amazing. Apparently its not available in all countrys and my country happens to be one of them. sad"

So you would type in the kind you like.I like pop Then just listen. But I had trouble turning of the music at first. so what you do is you have 2 go 2 the little box with 3 white boxes in it and select quit. Best app Eva!!!!!! : D"

45672,"Pandora",2012-09-30,5,"I love this app! I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I have also discovered some new artists that I have never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials but not too often. Thumbs up."
45674,"Pandora",2013-08-17,4,"ok This is a great app. But it would be even better if you could keep listening to the same song over and over again. That is why I just gave it 4 stars. Sometimes it does not work though. Otherwise it is the best music app in my opinion."
45680,"Pandora",2016-02-17,5,"I love Pandora listen all the time on my kindle I love Pandora listen all the time on my kindle fire"
45681,"Pandora",2012-12-10,1,"Adds freeze kindle I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you are not actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come."
45683,"Pandora",2012-05-13,2,"can not view bookmarks this is a great app and all but the one thing it is missing is viewing the bookmarks. there is absolutely no options to view your bookmarks. I want to check out the songs and artists that I bookmarked but sadly I can not. Please Pandora fix this issue on your app in order to make this app great again."
45685,"Pandora",2013-12-10,1,"PANDORA IS HORRIBLE Pandora is horrible!! Its slow!! It laggggs really bad. I wanted to purchase Pandora 1 but its not worth the dollar 4 a month to listen to silence!!"

45688,"Pandora",2015-07-08,5,"nice app it shows you many cool songs on the app and it is a cool for parties I really like this app so try it"
45689,"Pandora",2017-09-16,2,"Confusing for me! I thought it was a radio station can not navigate it at all."

45698,"Pandora",2013-02-05,5,"Best FREE music app ever Pandora lets you listen to music ANY type you want. You create your own station of music any genre type artist song or anything!!!!! All it requires is Internet access!!! Well if you haven't already got this app from reading the first sentence get it!!!"
45699,"Pandora",2013-04-29,4,"Great App I like this app and the music you can listen too. Once you have chosen your genre it will keep suggestions and songs coming. I do wish Kindle had a better speaker but the sound is not bad and you can listen to your songs without disturbing others."
45702,"Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Amazing I think this is the best way to listen to music. You could have all the songs you want but on phones people by there favorite music when you can get it free right on Pandora. In my opinion I think it is amazing!"

45711,"Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"loved it till recently. plays one song and freezes. i have to quit close app and reopen....just to hear one song and Repeat! Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution."
45712,"Pandora",2015-05-16,5,"love I loved it because when netflix is not working I just put this on and play games then my games stop working."

45718,"Pandora",2014-01-08,5,"GREAT I like background music and can not stand ads. By using this app I can select the kind of music I like or in the mood for and turn it up. The adds on the free app are short and do not come on very often."

45745,"Pandora",2011-10-24,5,"absolutly awesome service i have love pandora ever since the first time i have heard of the service. it is not for everyone i admit because not everyone is interested in find new artists that are almost identical to the songs/artists they love. but if you want to expand your harizons of artists and genres this is the perfect app for you."
45755,"Pandora",2012-01-02,3,"no more songs? This has recently happened; I listen to Pandora constantly it is really great and has introduced me to a lot of new songs and artist but now every time I listen to a particular station it says no more songs can be played/found. I haven't had this issue before. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?"
45757,"Pandora",2017-10-15,5,"great service connected to my audio equipment for awesome sound could live without ads but it is free so c'est la vie Love it!!!"
45762,"Pandora",2013-10-09,1,"Terrible recently I would give pandora 5 stars it is an awesome way to listen to music if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on listen to one song turn it off and try again and it will not work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it but I have used already this time? Shut down my kindle and hope it works."

45772,"Pandora",2012-12-11,5,"I really do not understand Why is every one complaining about the commercials? Do you guys realize that Pandora makes virtually no reasonable profit from providing this FREE service? Where else can you listen to the music of your choice for free? The radio? Come on people cut these guys some slack."
45778,"Pandora",2015-11-12,5,"Five Stars great"

45781,"Pandora",2013-08-18,1,"refresh ing Had to refresh after every song. Very frustrating! do not think it was my fault either if it was my Droid shame on Pandora for having such a bad app."
45785,"Pandora",2013-04-05,5,"My Music happy I love Pandora so much. I love being able to listen to what I want to and skip the songs I do not like! I also like putting my opinion out there by leaving a comment like I love this song so much so I hope that those of you reading this will be inspired to get the app and ENJOY happy"
45787,"Pandora",2012-03-20,4,"Good App Good app to help you find artists and songs that are similar to ones that you already know and like. Type in an artist and Pandora will play songs from them and others in the same gendre. The only complaint is the ads and not being able to skip songs as much as I would like to sometimes."

45803,"Pandora",2013-08-01,3,"it is ok! I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it is better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist"
45808,"Pandora",2014-02-13,3,"it is ok no radioio for selection but ok. it is ok so far. not sure if Silk is the issue but while listinening in the background and browsing other sites Pandora has quit playing. that is annoying and should not happen."
45809,"Pandora",2012-12-09,1,"horrid no longer do I wish to waste my time with this ixmpecible app. as a music app critic I have heard and used every app for music known. in all of my career this has been one of the most repolsive. no sound ever ame even with the volume on Max. I was declined of severally stations and the same song plays every ten minutes. if you r looking for an app worth the time continue your search by pressing back and scrolling to other options"
45810,"Pandora",2011-12-05,3,"permissions Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates. I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information or why it has to be pinged so frequently. I understand that they need general location data for advertisements but up to the minute is completely unnecessary. What is this company up to?"

45868,"Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best online music with a great app There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version. This app allows for both but if you do not have a subscription then expect commercials and popups. The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps no ads and higher bitrate streaming.I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
45873,"Pandora",2013-05-05,5,"AWESOME!! My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I recommend this."
45874,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"its the best music app ever. do not waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app. its free also instead of paying"
45881,"Pandora",2013-08-19,1,"hmm This thing is not letting me listen to music !! I haven't been able to for like 2 weeks !! I am done I am going to another music app !!"

45886,"Pandora",2011-10-24,3,"song choices are great. Ads played over the songs are not I do not mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying. The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense. Maybe it is a glitch but I do not really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background."
45887,"Pandora",2014-10-09,5,"fun music I LOVE THE PANDORA MUSIC THATS WHY I USE THIS APP THE END what no do not GO RIGHT NOW OKAY NOW YOU CAN GO THE END FINNALY"

45889,"Pandora",2013-01-04,3,"I guess I was expecting something more I entered that I wanted to hear Lady Gaga. I heard one Lady Gaga song and the rest were songs from all the pop princesses like Brittney Spears Katy Perry etc. Then I entered I wanted to hear Little Big Town. Once again I heard two Little Big Town songs and rest of the songs were just numerous other country singers that I do not really care to hear. I am a little disappointed. I guess I was expecting to hear only the singers I requested."
45891,"Pandora",2012-12-12,3,"problems I think Pandora has a better music quality than iheartradio but I have problems switching stations. I often have more then one song playing at one time so I have to uninstall the app to get it to stop playing which is really annoying during school."
45892,"Pandora",2012-12-17,1,"Ads are way too annoying! Sure its a free app and I expect ads but they are way too intrusive.And only having a limited number of song skips each hour is silly! Why should I have to listen to songs I do not like? Why do they even have that rule?"
45894,"Pandora",2017-10-24,2,"Two Stars Too many commercials!"
45896,"Pandora",2012-11-25,5,"Its wonderful except I love the app and when the kindle is plugged into the charger battery life is not the problem. But after every two songs it plays the same annoying advertisement I know that is how Pandora makes money. But come on every two songs???"
45897,"Pandora",2011-12-23,5,"The Music you Love to Hear I have been a Pandora fan for a long time.

46038,"Pandora",2011-11-17,1,"it is not as customizable as one might think... For something that touts itself as internet radio it is customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you have likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists and only those artists I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short if you are picky about your music look elsewhere. This is not going to give you many real options for customizing your personal station .Signed Pamela T."

46977,"Pandora",2011-10-24,2,"Not for me I did not really like the way Pandora chose music for me. I would try to get it to go more toward my genre but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I was not interested in. It also set up stations too frequently.I ended up deleting Pandora and will have to find another app which suits me more."
46979,"Pandora",2012-09-26,5,"its coo Pandora is really really cool......it has really good songs and it is really fun to listen to when your bored"

I use the free version so I experience the occasional ad So much better than buying iTunes or using youtube for music. As a heavy metal fan some of the bands I like are less popular but I can find them all here. I am amazed some local and lesser known bands are featured on this service. It makes me glad that the ad revenue goes to supporting them in making more great music for my enjoyment."

They have a huge variety so pretty much any song you are looking for they will have. The radio stations created based on artists tend to play a lot of the same songs over and over. I use the paid version so I do not have to listen to ads when I workout and I will continue to do so."

Nice design and interface. it is easy to learn and a good service but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone.

Nice app for organizing music but do not like the idea that in order to listen off line need to pay for premium. Disappointing . I will not be paying 10 dollar a month. Maybe once and done. Where can I find a free app besides iTunes thats free???"
47515,"Spotify",2015-06-19,3,"PLEASE READ MY REVIEW BEFORE BUYING!! I love this app but it sends me 71 EMAILS EVERY DAY! One is 99 ways to listen to music your favorite music based on your search history. Please only buy this app to listen to music! do not sign in with your EMAIL unless you have to! I myself prefer RDIO it is a great app to listen to music to."
47520,"Spotify",2015-08-01,3,"great app for the most part I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99 cent for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I am in the car for example it says no internet connection and will not let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing."

47525,"Spotify",2014-08-07,3,"While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical ... While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical commercials for contemporary music. Music sets a mood. The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music. These interruptions are truly ill conceived. I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met."

47553,"Spotify",2015-08-13,5,"Great app for streaming your music... Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a dollar 9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind.

The free version is okay but being a student getting the premium for dollar 5 a month is totally worth it. Gives you the power to control music across devices that are on the same account via cellular connection or wifi. Downloading tracks are worth it for road trips or when you are out of the city! Lastly the music library in which you can pull from is always growing and is very solid! Oh and by the way it also syncs with your itunes library as well as shazam! So you get the best of all worlds!"

Also on the web I do not have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta or something. It was not really specified as to why I should not have ads with my account but I still get the on mobile app. Another issue is that I can not find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it is viable through high speed internet. The app kinda sucks and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms but at least they thought of us Amazon users."

I am NOT the one to be rating this app. I am so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes. In fact I have only used the app once the day it was downloaded.So far... I have only one band that I have clicked to follow. MUSE. The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs. The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. SORRY Ad Agencies So it is just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group. hahaha. Though I am sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There was not any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues. And sounded pretty good with earphones on. So with my limited knowledge of these things take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

53005,"Spotify",2015-12-06,4,"Great. Ehh. Resentment.... I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I would be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user I ran into the same skip limit as if I did not shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT! and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely no fuss or gimmicks this is with Premium after the fail of Pandora free and paid services I figured I would start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS One Audio Two and the legendary Wu Tang Clan to our Modern Day I Guess This Is What We Call Rap Music to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182 to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's and 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. that is what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that is how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant in fact I can ad more to it there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There were not enough photos games and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless and that is just based off the experiences I have read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let us say Netflix cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would have gotten a bigger Kindle external memory wise. What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones scroll your favorite Playlists you created skip and scroll through your music freely and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. coughs Pandora coughs. In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go for the home depends on where at home it can be either the XBOX the Smart TV and now the HDX 8. You can not really beat or put a price on that Spotify however did and it is only dollar 12.99/month. what is that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I will pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it is features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can not go wrong."

53106,"Spotify",2016-01-10,4,"Nice app but could use some upgrades. I subscribe to Spotify premium and I got this app for our Fire TV stick. It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works but I do not like that I need to use a second device to change the songs etc. Also sometimes the connection is not stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it is ok but I think app could use some work.I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you please give me a Yes vote on my review!"

I do not think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app. It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well. Since it is Christmas time it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums. Very nice. Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now. One thing I do not understand is how this service is available for free. It does have a few commercials VERY few. It just does not make any sense to me but I am not complaining.

You can look up any artist song or album and Spotify will probably have it. there is rarely any adds and you can save whichever music you like to your personal library. The only downfall is that you need wifi to be able to use it but if you get premium you can listen to your personal music whenever wherever. Overall it is a great app."

56627,"Spotify",2016-03-12,3,"its ok I really thought it would be good at first because all my friends that had it said it was great. I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist and then I went through a few and number 34;top 50 and number 34; stations and added some more songs. Then its putting in songs on my library that I did not add saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon."

56840,"Spotify",2015-05-30,3,"it is all about the Ads You can get pretty much any type of music and make a great playlist but I can not seem to get away from commercials! Maybe there is something I am doing wrong but if I play my downloaded songs even they have commercials every 3 songs. I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I would lose the ads but I am not willing to do that as I do not listen to music constantly or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads. I would rather buy a CD if that is the case. I do not like the Playlist Radio because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist. it is irritating. The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like but I have zero Abba songs and nothing like that on my playlists but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba of course. I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow. Still I do enjoy being able to play somewhat without interruption a grouping of songs I have chosen."

57645,"Spotify",2015-09-18,5,"spotify is the best With an almost surprisingly large catalogue there is something for everyone. You can discover or rediscover all kinds of great music. The app runs great I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music but I can not really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it is not so bad. Personally I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free but you can listen to music offline which is great for things like long car trips."

58168,"Spotify",2016-03-11,5,"Great music app Great music app. I have had premium for years. One thing I do not like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded it will change to a different version. ie:I have had Walk the Line by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song it was a live version rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers instrumentals or live versions. Other than that I love everything about this app."

You are able to listen to all you favorites make playlists and brows music you would have never found without Spotify. I like to use the menu on a song to start a radio station around that song then use the thumbs up or thumbs down to personalize the sounds I like. I love being able to download certain songs/playlist/ albums in order to use the offline mode that does not take any data from my limited plan. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants all your music in one place."

For example when I am trying to add a mass amount of songs to a playlist it is very time consuming. Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together and not just in the playlistsThanks"

When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

58687,"Spotify",2015-09-09,3,"It was GREEEAT ...before the update : It was perfect .... before the update.Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement Also you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.After now: You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can not put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.The update was just today. 9/9/15 I feel so upset. The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify is not very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.I am so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can not afford premium. it is not worth it. :"
58689,"Spotify",2016-11-22,4,"Meh Some covers the artists like nightcore are not on there and some of the songs are not available unless you pay for premium. Lots of ads but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They do not have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it will not work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds artists and songs with related or same words. It also does not have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall it is only great if you spend money to buy premium but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi."

58706,"Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"Why haven't you subscribed to Premium yet! Go do it! Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let us face it were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear listen share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

58757,"Spotify",2016-07-23,5,"One word Awesome!!! Definitely has become my favorite app. I like all kinds of music but I would have to say jazz is my favorite genre. I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the related artists sections provided that let us me explore even more bands I just hope I have enough time left here on earth to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

58771,"Spotify",2014-07-08,5,"Five Stars 5 STARS"
58772,"Spotify",2017-06-12,2,"I miss Napster. Terrible user interface. I try to play a song on my phone but it plays on my Alexa upstairs apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on. Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song and then play that. I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times but boy do I miss Napster."
58776,"Spotify",2014-07-04,5,"Five Stars Great"
58785,"Spotify",2016-08-20,5,"Get Premium its worth it......for some Spotify has replaced my iTunes.Now some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless however there are benefits to this service.Not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player. The ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome. If you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it.If you are already purchasing and download more than 10 songs a month you will save money with this service."
58792,"Spotify",2016-11-12,5,"Absolutely love this app I have used a lot of music apps over the years but I have never found one as great as Spotify and I loved the app so much I even upgraded to the Student Premium which is even better. And for dollar 4.99 a month you can not beat the price or the quality."
58801,"Spotify",2016-05-11,4,"okay but it could be better It is actually very useful for listening to music and podcasts. The thing is although it has many songs you might not always find the song you are looking for. Yet the format is very neat organized and easy to use. But once again there is a little problem that I have experienced. Every once and awhile I will be listening to music with my volume turned up and my headphones on but there will not be any sound. It will say that the song is playing but you can not here it. This has caused me to have to delete and redownload the app many times. Nevertheless this is a very good app and hopefully you will not have any glitches."
58803,"Spotify",2016-03-07,5,"Let There Be Rock! Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse and worse until the point of being unbearable when it would not even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement and came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product zero playback issues and they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
58804,"Spotify",2016-02-17,5,"Get it. Srsly Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists in case you are wanting to just have it on while you are working or working out. Just have the free version thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."
58805,"Spotify",2017-03-02,5,"Spotify I love it"
58811,"Spotify",2015-11-05,2,"log in problems Many times I try logging in and out tells me something like this email address is already linked to a Spotify account . Right! Because it is my account and I am logging in I am not trying to set up a new account. Otherwise the app works as it should."
58812,"Spotify",2015-02-22,2,"Not allowing me to pay for premium I would appreciate Spotify Music more if it allowed me to use by Visa Debit card to pay for premium monthly. Can you imagine that I am willing to make a monthly payment for this service and just because I am in the Caribbean I am restricted and then it seems that when they noticed that I am not from any of the approved regions I assume they figured that out after i entered my card info i got locked out of my account all together stupse. So I am annoyed. When they get their act together i most likely would give a higher rating....Smh to think people bout the place pirating and I am willing to pay and here strugglin stupse."
58815,"Spotify",2016-08-13,2,"Some things make no sense to me no sense to me nonsense to me It was wonderful then a billing error and I can not access my music playlists recommendations my availability to get artist and cover art pictures. Seriously my card was stolen and I do not know the last 4 numbers of the card because I do not know which one was stolen. How do I do that if all my cards were stolen? Does this make sense to you? It does not make any sense to me? Explain sensai"
58822,"Spotify",2017-04-18,5,"Everything is great..... it is just the ads The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I have been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.But there is just one thing I hate to go threw..... The adsI just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors. I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.But I can not play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load Which sucks a lot since I am a music loverSometimes if I am LUCKY! See I caps the word luckyThe ad might play But other times it does not play at all which freakin' stinks!Anyway I do not know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these I just hope not That one random person who is ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic"
58824,"Spotify",2016-12-02,5,"is the best option. Finally Having spent hours utilizing all the streaming music apps websites share site...ect Spotify is the best option. Finally someone has it right. Premium option opens doors for work play gym and a plethora of other options. Especially when you can download your playlists and use it offline in those dungeonesqe areas of concrete and steel. Get it. Cheers B"
58825,"Spotify",2016-06-12,5,"omg Best app ever I love it you can listen to the music easily and quickly and Iove how you can make your own play list but I wish it was for free for you to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but I loveee itt !!!!"
58828,"Spotify",2016-08-30,5,"Spot On I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections. Very easy to use. I am 63 years young and still rock in. Which we had this in my school years beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
58832,"Spotify",2016-09-26,5,"Best music app and program ever This app is awesome! I have been looking for a app that plays songs while I play games etc. Thank you so much!"
58840,"Spotify",2017-07-09,5,"Fun Great tunes easy to use"
58841,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"Game changer for music lovers My family really enjoys this app. In fact we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials"
58842,"Spotify",2014-12-25,4,"Great App! Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion because you can make your own playlist with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips but more it seems than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most unknown to the people around me. Over all a really fantastic app.Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them."
58844,"Spotify",2016-12-26,5,"Excellent This is a lit app. Works well on the Fire tablet."
58846,"Spotify",2015-03-04,2,"Meh.. Something is very wrong with this app it wants to reinstall itself every time I open it it is very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/ twentieth of the amount I wanted to have offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account so every time I deactivated my original and opened spotify it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can not switch payment plans to another account so it is stuck on that until I get rid of spotify which will probably be soon."
58848,"Spotify",2016-07-09,5,"Great !!!!!! it is a great way of listening to music"
58851,"Spotify",2015-01-20,2,"Worked great Now almost unusable At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now seemingly out of nowhere it can not get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It does not seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps I.e. Pandora seem to be working just fine. I am about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"
58852,"Spotify",2017-02-16,5,"LOVE Spotify! Wonderful app better than Google Play or Pandora. It gives me a lot more listening options. I can select the artists or songs I want."
58854,"Spotify",2017-04-01,5,"Solid Works as advertised"
58855,"Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I do not mind but they pause and can not play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen . . . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park in the end numb and no more sorrow you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
58856,"Spotify",2017-04-08,5,"Get it if you are picky about songs. I love this app it is the best apps ever it is 1 out of the 7 apps I downloaded on my Tablet but if you are not patient then sorry every 30 minutes they give you like 2 or 3 adds no biggie. I am even listening to Paris on Spotify right now !!!"
58866,"Spotify",2017-06-29,5,"good Easy to use and does not limit music played like other similar apps"
58868,"Spotify",2014-07-31,5,"Best Music App ever. This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. it is beautiful chic and it has great sound quality.ignore old review of this it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads but they are not very common. Also it is has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you will ever make."
58871,"Spotify",2017-01-14,5,"A boon to music appreciation and musicianship. I have found songs I thought I would never find again. I even discovered a new favorite tune that if not for Spotify would not have. Spotify is a revolutionary development to today's music lover."
58873,"Spotify",2017-01-02,2,"While the ads are super annoying more annoying is the constant suggested songs I have the free version. While the ads are super annoying more annoying is the constant suggested songs ."
58874,"Spotify",2017-02-19,5,"Oh yes wonderful! Play while playing or working on your tablet etc. The beauty that is the music via Spotify is right here."
58875,"Spotify",2015-09-15,3,"I love the app but... I am in love with Spotify but ever since there are two problems I with the new update:1 You can no longer choose a certain song you must always click the shuffle button and skip untill you find the song you want to hear.2 If you are listening your own playlist the app now adds recommended songs on there too.Honestly I think this made the app a lot less enjoyable and I find it annoying. I think if they want to recommend you songs they should email you them like the old way."
58877,"Spotify",2017-02-21,5,"Crazy Song app Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that."
58882,"Spotify",2016-06-22,4,"Bruh ._. Okay so I update spotify and it says I have NO internet while I am clearly connected to the internet. I also hate how 3/4 of the options are only for Premium. This makes me an unhappy customer I am not going to waste my time buying some Premium when I could easily get my favorite songs from YouTube to mp3."
58888,"Spotify",2016-09-14,3,"Love this app but Love the app and how it works except for this device sharing I share my account with my mom who has her own playlist. When I would like to listen to one song in my own playlist and she wants to listen to a song in hers my tablet will play the same song she is playing on her separate iphone se and vice versa I can not listen to anything without it playing on her phone I do not like it. I have tried to turn it off but nothing seems to work please fix this."
58897,"Spotify",2015-11-22,3,"Ughh This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It does not continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it will play a song and leave a 5 10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it is the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it is a necessary evil."
58899,"Spotify",2016-10-01,5,"To all music bow downers... Love Love LOVE THIS APP !!! All the had music you. Could ask for ... As a music Lover the greatest music app I have ever tried!

No commercials and no data usage. it is not worth the higher monthly fee to me once the trial expires so at that point I will be cancelling premium and going back to the free version.

One does not need to sift through 'covers' or sound quality and the tracks are delineated with shuffling queuing communities following and such. Basic one is free or a monthly fee version with more features that are worth the expense is the upgrade."

They say it is the developer. The notice during the download says it is not compatible to the Kindle device makes no sense at all. Now trying to download to my android phone for at least a week and no luck. I would like to have a music selection without having to load up from my computer every dang cd I have. sucks!"

I hate this app because though it has a lot of music it does not allow for more than a few skips of disliked songs AND if I do not have enough songs on a playlist like more than five or six it forcefully adds MORE from other artists it THINKS are similar onto MY playlist. NOPE! I DELETED it and replaced it with Tunein and IHeartRadio which are much MORE user friendly in MY opinion."
59708,"Spotify",2014-08-10,1,"Could be better. can not skip songs."
59714,"Spotify",2017-05-23,1,"Try Amazon Prime Music Instead Not for me personally. Amazon Music is much better."

59751,"Spotify",2017-01-26,5,"A Awesome app!"
59755,"Spotify",2015-11-08,1,"I loved this app I loved this app! I used it everyday until the recent update locked all my songs and changed it to shuffle only. I have since then stopped using it and returned to youtube because I want to hear my own music. The ads never bothered me I would deal with them if I could relax to the music I felt like playing at the time. It used to be so simple to use and now it is not. This app is on my kindle and now it just has the phone version of spotify. it is awful."
59757,"Spotify",2017-01-08,1,"Terrible horrible awefull I wish I could give this no stars. I tried it on my Alexa app for my Amazon Tap. It will not work on the Alexa without going premium. When I try to delete it from the Alexa app it does not show unlink account from Alexa as instructions says. It only has link your account I guess the icon and premium connection is stuck on my Alexa app forever. Tried to cancel my account on Spotify website. can not do that either. Instructions suck there also. I just want rid of this account and removed from my Alexa app. UGH!!!"
59763,"Spotify",2015-07-25,1,"I hate it Spotify is the worst music app and I do not trust your new and number 34;fancy and number 34; updates with a new shiny play button and bug fixes. You people are liars now I am stuck with the update along with two ads playing in a row and the same bugs I got. Again I do not TRUST THE UPDATES!"

59770,"Spotify",2015-11-26,1,"Horrible This app is falling down the drain. The app once allowed kindle fire users to pick any song on command but now they have took away our ability to do so. We only are capable as working like a mobile device having to click shuffle play in order to play music even from our play lists. This act they have done is not fair and I vehemently believe we shall be able to freely pick a song on kindle fire tablets."
59774,"Spotify",2017-04-29,4,"Lies I hate how I am just trying to listen to my Twenty One Pilots but when I played it it said: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad free music. So I am like OK. So one three and a half song later it says: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad free music and three more ads after that. But it is still a good app because I can make playlists of my favorite songs."
59780,"Spotify",2017-06-12,1,"I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS AND IT SHOWED UP AS A PURCHASE IN MY ACCOUNT This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it. I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password."

59815,"Spotify",2016-07-14,5,"Spotify is Sensational Very versatile music app. You have the option of listening to radio stations choosing your own music downloading music...Putting together playlists are easy and all the music is cataloged in one app. Very user friendly also."
59816,"Spotify",2015-01-15,1,"lame It never loads to the screen.This is for something else for the maker of kindle fire. Why can not you guys put better apps on here I mean I got this kindle because I thought it be the best tablet for me. But I guess I was wrong. My phone has better game social music and book apps. What about games like clash of clans or all the new game apps coming out on Android or iPhone. kindle is lacking I would not be surprised if people went to get a different tablet. Step your game up"
59818,"Spotify",2017-01-29,5,"All my music all the time anywhere. Spotify is the best works with Alexa rock on. No lyrics on the app cent . Unless I am not seeing how. Still worth having premium though. I am visually impaired and I can not imagine life without having Spotify and the echo dot."

59824,"Spotify",2017-02-02,4,"Its really good but one thing I love it how i can have podcasts and any song i want in one playlist. Just sucks how you need to pay for offline mode."
59825,"Spotify",2017-02-23,5,"Amazing! One of the best music sites out there! I have been using Spotify for at least 3 weeks and I have loved it ever since I first got it. Definitely recommended!"
59829,"Spotify",2015-09-09,1,"Why did you ruin it for us?? Spotify was great for tablet users. We could listen to any song and only had one ad not too often. Then they added another ad the most annoying being for Spotify and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but could not and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems true but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app."
59831,"Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"My Spotify Experience Spotify is great. Here you can find so many great songs by many artists. Spotify definitely is worth every second of great music."
59832,"Spotify",2015-04-06,5,"Rockin wit the Spotify! Spotify app is on the money!!! I use the free version and I love it. I have found artist and songs that I haven't heard in years. Spotify is unique in that when you search for an artist you get that artist music only. If you want similar artist their name and music is to the right side of the page. No mixing if you do not want to mix.I love being able to listen to a specific entire albums of an artist and that is something you can not do on Pandora... And do not get me wrong I love Pandora."
59841,"Spotify",2015-09-26,1,"Useless if you have an existing account It will not let me log into my existing account. It keeps telling me that I already have an account with that email address duh but does not let me log into it even though I tell it to 'log in' as opposed to 'create account.' The effect is that this app is broken for me and is useless. Anyone from customer service reading this? Respond and help me fix it."

59921,"Spotify",2014-08-08,5,"Coolio Spotify is AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I would say it is much better than Pandora and iheartradio. You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too! You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify! at loviemonsters!"

I did not really like Pandora because you could not listen to the songs you wanted to listen to at that time.On Spotify I can listen to the music I want to listen to any time! I can listen to my favorite artists like Melanie Martinez Twenty One Pilots and Hasley! This is probably the best music app..........EVER!!"

60067,"Spotify",2016-06-27,5,"Perfect gift for my grandson! He seemed disappointed at first only downloading the app on his cellular phone but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."

60072,"Spotify",2017-06-03,3,"Great on laptops sucks mobile! Had the app on my phone would not let me play my playlists at all only on shuffle play. Like it better on Kindle and on a laptop no problems there."
60075,"Spotify",2015-11-05,4,"Eureka! Where have you been all my life? I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the Discover function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past and my past is pretty extensive. Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again and they are repetitious but since most of my music listening is via radio that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"

60093,"Spotify",2016-08-07,4,"No hotbar changer. it is great for people who have unlimited data.... My main issue is that there is no hotbar player for when the app is open. I do not enjoy having to go back from Silk to Spotify to skip a song. P.S: I am using a Gen 2 Kindle Fire that was purchased in 2012."
60095,"Spotify",2014-08-05,1,"sucks P2w bulls sucks m8"
60099,"Spotify",2015-10-25,1,"From an extremely angry user I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads did not bother me too much. Then the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi but now I just do not want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit is not an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I would rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I am really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you have lost many users to this and you are just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore so I will just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. you are Welcome Spotify"
60104,"Spotify",2017-06-16,5,"The best there is I have been using Spotify for several years now and I have to say it is my streaming app of choice. First of all you can find almost anything on it from music to even things like guided meditation or audio books. So it is the first place I search when I hear about a new artist or song. Or if I am looking for an old song or an artist I used to love but lost track of over the years. And lots of people from celebrities to critics will post special playlists you can choose from as well. I am constantly reading articles that send you to a new playlist worth checking out. I also love being able to use downloaded playlists offline if I am driving or flying too.The app itself is pretty foolproof though sometimes searching can be a little bit tricky. And you still can not alphabetize your playlists which gets messy. . Nothing else works as well or has so much to offer yet."
60105,"Spotify",2016-06-21,5,"Cannot Live Without This! There is nothing I can say about Spotify that has not been said a million times before. This program is simply amazing. For just over dollar 10.00 a month I can listen to any song pretty much ever created. I get the new radio singles new albums singles from weird indie bands I have never heard of customized playlists Sunday playlists for when I want to chill the ability to search by song artist or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to every day constantly non stop I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you do not have a membership get one ASAP. This is how music playing should be! I have it installed on my computer cellphone and Kindle so I have access to it from literally anywhere. Please and thank you!"

It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire. I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues. They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope. The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."
60115,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass. I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify you can go on any device log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I am not trying to sound like a commercial or anything I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So what I am trying to say is Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music new or old at all times. And yes it has commercials but only one every 30 minutes and apparently with Spotify Premium you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99 cent !!! I love Spotify."
60121,"Spotify",2014-12-30,1,"not using because of security warning I downloaded this app from the Amazon app store for my Kindle Fire HDX. At first it worked fine but then when I accessed it it displayed a dialog box which said: APP COMPATIBILITY: Unfortunately this app has not yet been updated to the latest compatibility or security standards. We have notified the developer and asked them to provide an updated version of this app. If you have any questions please notify our customer support team using the help app . Then it gave the options to either close or launch anyway. Considering the broad array of permissions that this app requires in any event I chose to close it and will not be using it until it is cleared by Amazon. Wait a minute they are the ones who sold it to me in the first place as an app approved for use on the Kindle. Confused yet? I am!"
60123,"Spotify",2017-01-30,5,"SPOTIFY IS FANTASTC!!!! Spotify is absolutely wonderful. I am in my 60's and really hate being exposed to do much of the electronic things. But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist yes and some new songs. I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
60139,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"ERM MEH GERD SO AMAZING Okay so I highly recommend this is you love music cause like you find all your favorite songs and make a playlist and just.. relax and listen to it all its awesome I read and listen to my playlists on spotify I can not even express how amazing this app is just... download it for yourself and find out!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!! :D also in. 16 so... If your a teen lookin for music and etc. This is soooooo for you!!! :3 :D"
60141,"Spotify",2017-09-02,5,"Great Amazing app"
60146,"Spotify",2016-11-29,5,"Incredible App I have tried Pandora... Jango... Sound Cloud... and quite a darn few other music apps... but Spotify had everything I was looking for... it is dollar 10 ten for the premium version... I do not buy the premium. And it is still an incredible app... I absolutely love music and this app has everything a music lover needs... Definitely a must have app."
60152,"Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"I like it. it is a pretty good app. The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed. It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps and I spend half of my time on the app waiting for it to load again. But I can create playlists which is a step up from many sites; not just I like this band play me their channel and similar songs/artists but outright putting songs in order on a listing with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites I could not find a few of the songs or artists I wanted and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts like Lady of Shallot which has 5 versions on this site none of which include the full song."
60155,"Spotify",2016-05-28,5,"Reviewed today Nice selections"
60156,"Spotify",2017-02-24,5,"love it I love how I can listen to whatever song or artist I want and still have radio stations that at are based on what I listen too."
60159,"Spotify",2014-09-05,1,"WHY Amazon will not you support your own device? I was excited after a long time of waiting to get a legit version of Spotify on my first gen Fire. I had to watch two new models in the line release and now that Spotify is finally on the Amazon store you will not support my Fire in running it!? I bought the friggin extended warranty too! How much money do I have to give you before you will uphold your end of the deal?!"
60160,"Spotify",2017-08-01,5,"Spotify Premium is the best way to stream music! I absolutely love Spotify and I use it all the time. I have Spotify Premium and it definitely worth paying for it. I use it everyday some day and almost all hours of the day. I also love he offline mode so that if your not on wifi you can still listen to the playlist you choose. With Spotify premium there is not ads unlimited skips and you can listen to anything you want to. it is definitely the best source for music streaming. Thanks Spotify!"
60166,"Spotify",2015-09-07,4,"Best Music App with Minor Issues This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion. You can easily access all of your options and it plays clearly with very few issues. One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online. I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track. Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play. I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song. Other than that I really like the app and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps Pandora IHeartRadio etc. out there."
60169,"Spotify",2017-08-06,5,"Amazing!!!!!!!! If you love a lot of songs and music well this is the app for you!!!! It has so many songs. You can make your own music playlist. It has some ads but they barley are on. Lol I suck at reviews. This also has radio. This is so much better than iHeartRadio"
60170,"Spotify",2016-01-20,5,"Better than Pandora for sure I love my spotify. I have the free version. I use it primarily when I am working on my computer for music background or working out or working. When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music you do not have to worry about turning the channel or hoping the next song is better. They are all great songs because it is your selection. You can make different lists too which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it."
60175,"Spotify",2017-01-25,1,"This app sucks I can not even click on anything!!!!!!!!"
60176,"Spotify",2017-07-24,1,"Sorry Spotify you lost me! I have been using Spotify for a few years both the free version and subscription. I stopped the subscription because it was too expensive for the amount of time I actually used it and now that I am back to the free version I cannot play any songs I want when I use it on my phone app. it is always on shuffle basically no control over my music and the ads are so annoying. I got the same skin disease ad all day over and over while sitting at my work computer SO EMBARASSING. I downloaded VIBBIDI free and it is WAY better I can actually choose the songs I want to listen to."
60177,"Spotify",2014-07-10,5,"Best music app for streaming discovery and sharing Spotify is my favorite music app by far. it is great for playing almost anything you can think of. You can search by song album or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created or make your own. The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it is own suggestions and there are several add ons last.fm Hype Machine Pitchfork Rolling Stone Recommends etc. that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what is new and popular. The social element is also fun. You can follow other users including artists and see what they are listening to and share songs and playlists. I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!"
60178,"Spotify",2016-11-22,1,"HOLY CRAP THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! THIS APP IS SO DAM CONFUSING!!!!!! I TRY TO PLAY A SONG AND IT WONT LET ME!!!!!!!! WARNING: DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS!!!!!!"
60184,"Spotify",2014-08-30,1,"will not install on my kindle fire The application will download and will not install on my kindle fire. It does not give any explaination it pops up a dialog box that says it cannot be installed."
60191,"Spotify",2017-08-11,1,"Secret Overcharges Horrible Customer Service First of all I have been a loyal premium user student subscription for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions as well the other features provided offline streaming Discover station etc.However beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription dollar 9.99 for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged dollar 30 more without the possibility of a refund DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.Second good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad your credit card MUST match the country you are in which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance payments i.e. 3 months or more so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow 24 hours to receive an automated email response and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly."
60193,"Spotify",2017-07-13,5,"... using Spotify for years now and I am in love with it I have been using Spotify for years now and I am in love with it. I used to have problems trying to find all kinds of free music downloader apps and apps like pandora... but Spotify really has it all! It is your one stop shop for endless playback new music radio options while being able to follow artists and your friends. I highly recommend this app if you are an avid music listener you like finding random music or for just about anyone else out there. It has something for all!!!"
60194,"Spotify",2016-09-13,5,"I love this! I love this!!! I can find almost any song I like and play it whenever I want. So much better that Pandora where you cannot pick the exact song you want. And it is free!!! I just can not listen without internet without paying. that is fine by me. I let this play whenever I am cleaning. I can skip songs if I am not in the mood for them but usually I just let my song list play. I picked the songs so I like every song that comes up"
60198,"Spotify",2017-10-10,5,"Caters to musical taste Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music and out of all of them Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clients' musical needs by providing a wide selection of music creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers Spotify is a great service to try out especially since they do offer free trials."
60201,"Spotify",2015-02-23,5,"Spotify beats Pandora Trust me on this one This is the best music app I ever seen! and you can even make a song playlist and make it so people can look at them and follow the playlist then....YOU! but that is only when if you make it publicAnd if your wondering what my profile is it is optical music and my old account is vikame anyways it has a lot of song and I mean a lot!!! You can find over 1 000 000 records/tracks and I am not lying!You can also share your playlist and you can even save songs that you like by touching a song and then touch the plus sign.There is a lot of different music genres like Rap Country Deep Web R and B And Emo but emo sucks so do not listen to it or you will kill yourself but I highly Recommend this app.SPOTIFY IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN PANDORA!!"
60202,"Spotify",2015-04-04,5,"beyond expectations I found this app on a vacation in France after Pandora told me I could not use out in Europe. Unlike leading music apps/radios you can create playlists listen to already made playlists or my favorite just search up particular songs artists or genres. Usually on Pandora our iheartradio you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app I have found absolutely every song I have looked for but one. It works great but like all others needs wifi or cell service. But it is still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!"
60206,"Spotify",2017-11-12,5,"The best it is better than Pandora to me at least... I love this app. Before i did have a couple of problems; but most likely because I did not know how to use it. But now I really love this app!!"
60208,"Spotify",2017-10-04,5,"Love this app Love this app. I have tried different music apps but this is user friendly in my book and can download so can be offline and listen anywhere. Has a huge selection of music which is great since I listen a lot to german music and no problem finding it."

Discover weekly slays pandora's lame attempts"
60213,"Spotify",2017-08-14,4,"Almost five stars Spotify is a fantastic service with great music content. I have used it for about 2 3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads which are always funny and interesting the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review."
60215,"Spotify",2017-08-08,5,"I love Spotify! I have their premium service and I ... I love Spotify! I have their premium service and I can listen to music offline I do not have any commercials and I can skip around as much as I like. I do not even need to try any of the other streaming services because Spotify has exactly what I need."
60216,"Spotify",2016-09-10,4,"Would have liked to give four stars ... I really would have given four stars to this had there been no ads. This is exactly the reason why I went from regular TV to Roku. I am sick of the commercials. I like that you are able to create playlists on Spotify so have been having fun with that. Also the browse feature is nice if you know who the artist is but forget the name of the song. All in all it is pretty good and I would recommend to all music lovers."

REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"

60253,"Spotify",2016-01-08,5,"Superior app This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended this will probably be your most used app yes even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."
60254,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best app for music playing especially with student discount. do not waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does apple music and more.

60269,"Spotify",2017-08-12,2,"Good concept continued weak execution Spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save. Downloads continue to randomly disappear forcing people to have to download again and again a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks. Also they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres e.g. Reggae. It has other functionality issues too. All of them seem eminently fixable yet they are never fixed."
60275,"Spotify",2017-03-09,5,"Great! Spirit is AWESOME! On the computer. On your phone you are very limited in what you do. Like you can not choose the song you want. You can only push shuffle play. And some times it chooses a different song that is in your playlist. A positive it is will warn you that the song is explicit. Very nice. Refined it highly because every single song is on it."

Yes it is the FREE version but with this version you can shuffle play channels and stations or artist related music which may include similar style songs from other artists but overall I really enjoy this app. Have not had any buffering issues over my wifi.

I just keep discovering more on Spotify. Love it!"
60297,"Spotify",2015-09-13,3,"Ok so ... This app has been the top music player up until the newest update and I would have rated it 5 stars until this update changed my mind very much . You see everything is mostly the same except your playlists . It used to be that you could go through your playlist and pick any song you were in the mood for.Now you have to shuffle your playlist until it comes to the song you want which is very confusing and difficult especially if you have quite a few songs on one playlist. I just think that it was perfect before the update without glitches and very few adds but this update upset me very much . I expected a lot more from you spotify ."

There are over 1 million songs and it is AWESOME"

I use it in my art classroom while students work and I listen to it while I work in my studio.

You can find different genres of music if you are wanting to listen to rock they spotify have multiple playlists of that genre if you like Indie music they have it pop rap love music acoustics etc. they have it all.

Spotify is heaven for people of all music tastes and I really thing it deserves 10 stars not just 5. Although there is one problem. Literally one. When trying to skip a song or two offline I have premium the song that I skipped to does not load and I have to wait to connect to WiFi before being able to listen to a different song really confusing because it says that I had premium. :|"

60435,"Spotify",2015-04-30,3,"it is Got Potential Yet another music streaming app. The app's front end is annoying and has interface issues with Facebook. Off and on it took me three months to get it properly working on all my devices. Help is community based which can be both a blessing and a curse. Obviously I have mixed feelings about this app. However it does have potential and because of that I would give it a slight nod over its main rival Pandora."

60441,"Spotify",2015-11-02,4,"almost all I want I used to listen to Pandora quite a bit which my son introduced me to. Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me and number 34;oh I do not even use Pandora anymore Spotify is much better. and number 34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application I haven't upgraded yet is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall I really enjoy it."

The only downside to it is that you have to pay dollar 9.99 a month if you want to listen to all your favorite tunes offline. Other than that THIS APP IS AWESOME. The variety of music makes it hard for me to choose what to listen to next and you can create your own playlists for free."

Songs with explicit content are constantly deleted without reason there is no enough music and the app version does not allow you to choose your song Shuffle mode I miss grooveshark so much spotify sucks big time. sad I hate the fact that the offline mode is only music stored in your cache memory and you do not actually own the song so it is not worth it to pay for the premium user because you are not downloading the songs you can not keep them recomendations are not accurate with what I would like to listen to and radios have always the same songs.Have been a daily user since grooveshark was closed actually I think spotify should be free because you do not get what you pay for."

I have found great music I did not know about by listening to others' playlists as well. The app is easy to use and the commercials are very reasonable in quantity and content."
61324,"Spotify",2017-07-21,5,"Awesome app!! Great app great quality music and everything"
61326,"Spotify",2014-12-24,5,"Best Music App I have Ever Seen I have used Pandora and iheartradio but neither of them are anywhere near as good as Spotify. On Spotify Free you can listen to any do not song you want and save it to a playlist. The only thing I would like to be able to do is download the songs without having to get Spotify Premium but I completely understand why the download feature would be for Premium."
61327,"Spotify",2017-04-07,5,"Excellent Excellent"
61328,"Spotify",2016-04-04,5,"Premium is worth the money. Am a premium subscriber family plan. Well worth it. Have it on my cell phone and my Amaozon Echo."

61339,"Spotify",2015-10-11,3,"Okay Something happened in the update that it only lets me play on shuffle and I can not pick just one song to listen to. And when I do not want to listen to a certain song on my playlist it only lets me skip a song 7 times and tries to get me to buy the full version of Spotify. So I only listen to Spotify when I am in a really good mood. It does not make sense HELP!"
61345,"Spotify",2017-03-20,5,"Phenomenal This is an amazing music streaming and downloading app! The fact that you can have a Premium 7 days FREE of ad free music and skippable music unlike I Heart Radio this is amazing!"

Great app overall. Highly recommended."
61350,"Spotify",2015-03-16,5,"Best Music App Hands Down Spotify is just the tits. I tried using the dollar 20 credit Amazon gave me for their app store but it would not allow it. I am using the free premium trial for now and will probably pay for it when it runs out. Just as an FYI: to make music available offline you MUST have the space in your phone. do not sign up for premium because of that perk without having the extra space."

61395,"Spotify",2015-12-23,5,"great app I love spotify so much. It works much like pandora in which you can create a radio station of an artist to discover new music. However you can also find a certain song and save it into 'your music' and play it anytime you want where there is WiFi for free. Overall it is a great app and definitely worth the download."
61397,"Spotify",2016-04-02,1,"good at first You have to pay money to actually pick songs to listen too. Otherwise you have to shuffle your playlist and risk having to listen too a random song they recommend. I am leaving this app alone till I get money. And you should too."
61400,"Spotify",2015-06-16,5,"A great way to get at the music you like. This is a great way to not only stay up to date with your favorite music stars/groups/composers but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones. The interface is busy but once you get used to where everything can be found it is very controllable and quick. A great experience."

61504,"Spotify",2015-11-21,2,"Spotify rocks but it has problems Spotify is wonderful but there is a huge problem. When enabling music to play offline it causes all downloaded music to be stored in your internal storage bank which fills up extremely quickly. The lack of option to move the storage to an SD cards means very minimal download space. I love Spotify but this is just a terrible side of this app. Hopefully they fix it soon."
61508,"Spotify",2015-10-23,4,"love this app So far this has been the best way for me to listen to music. I like that the have the offline mode for premium members it definitely saves my data when I am on the go. The only downside that I have found is the lack of songs available for certain artist but that is to be expected."
61513,"Spotify",2017-06-24,4,"Curate your daily soundtrack! Great platform for curating a play list and discovering new artists!"
61514,"Spotify",2017-07-24,3,"ok idk This app is the same as Pandora. I think you can listen free without WiFi but you need a premium account to do that . and I am pretty sure that costs MONEY. SO I STILL LIKE IT But you will not get to enjoy it for free. That is the.ONLY reason I downloaded this app because I thought I could listen for the dollar free.99 without WiFi. it is a little tricky at first. It slow too."

61527,"Spotify",2017-10-03,1,"Spotify is garbage Every time i try to create an account they are experiencing technical difficulties..."
61530,"Spotify",2015-03-17,1,"If it worked it would be great Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just will not play ever no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50 percent of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it but the other 50 percent of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself though.Return your Kindle asap buy a real tablet download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."
61533,"Spotify",2014-10-27,1,"No good on Samsung Galaxy 5 The app will not work on my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone. Spotify has tried to help me but this is a known issue on this phone. They want me to pull my SIM card but that requires me opening my Otter Box etc. and it is just not worth the trouble. I do use them on the computer and it works great. Really SAD that I cannot use this app on my phone."

In the meantime I keep getting dollar 9.99 for the last four months and I have nothing to show for it.. I do not listen to the station. I tried it couple of times and was not impress. I use Pandora. So I would be real careful about using this no support app. I have brought a radio station that is not user friendly mostly heavy rock offer. that is all I know and they do withdraw funds whenever they feel like. What does a music app have that Special for ten dollars nothing! BEWARE dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar"

61593,"Spotify",2016-07-03,5,"Awesome! A lot of people use Pandora but I prefer Spotify for its hands on song choice. it really gives a lot of options for making playlists from radios which are updated and random to choosing song by song. To whoever created Spotify: thanks and awesome job!"
61601,"Spotify",2017-02-03,5,"Great service and app I do not know what I would do without Spotify. I have it on my computer and two different mobile devices and they all work together flawlessly. The little bit extra for premium is the most worth while subscription I have ever had."

61653,"Spotify",2015-02-18,3,"A little better than Pandora Plus but twice the price. It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over unlike pandora but dollar 10 a month is bordering expensive if you like me like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."

When I first bought the app for free through the advise of my sister I was thrilled by the number of skips and how many songs you could download. But turns out these are really members for premium members. All of my downloaded songs were deleted and I was not allowed to skip anymore. What I wonder is why can easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money but I do not like this feature. Also. they play unrelated songs when your trial is over. You could get all the features you want but only if you upgrade to premium membership."

62324,"Spotify",2017-04-28,4,"App Suggestion Wish there was an option to watch music videos in a playlist listener designed rather than going to YouTube... want an app that is a one stop"
62330,"Spotify",2015-09-14,1,"Free is terrible. The premium is nice but the free version requires you to shuffle songs which would be fine if it played more than two songs of the album or playlist that you wanted to shuffle before playing nothing but suggested songs for a while and with only a couple opportunities to and number 34;skip and number 34;. So now you rarely listen to what you want which is the point of music streaming certainly rarely any particular song. You will be alarmed to try listening to Hozier only to instead become bombarded with suggested songs that you skip so that you are out of skips when and number 34;All About that Bass and number 34; inexplicably appears to assault you with no escape."
