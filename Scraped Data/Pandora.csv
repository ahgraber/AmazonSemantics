Pandora,"So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface",meme22,28-Dec-14,4,"Just getting started with Pandora.  So far I really like it, but have only scratched the surface.  Got an IHome wireless speaker for my Kindle Fire HDX so I can not have music I like wherever I like.  There are commercials, but are not terribly annoyin."
Pandora,Highly recommended,Buck Ziffero,5-Feb-14,5,"I have been a Pandora user for quite some time. I use it on all my computers at home and at my office.  I appreciate the fact that I can input the artists and style of music I prefer. If something is played I would rather not listen to again I can input that fact. I can listen to my playlist randomly, or select a particular artist/style to play.  I recently upgraded to a Kindle Fire HDX, and can now play music while I'm reading or anything else I may be doing on the Kindle.  I have tried several other downloadable music sites, and have found Pandora to be the most versatile and have the greatest choice of music as well as being the easiest to use."
Pandora,Five Stars,mike 1,1-Jan-15,5,awesome
Pandora,Five Stars,Mary M Reed,16-Aug-17,5,I love hearing my favorite tunes.
Pandora,Like it!,Adrienne Englund,4-Feb-13,4,"Panadora is one of my favorite FREE apps.  I use this app all the time when working out, and I love the variety of music they have for free on here!  I just downloaded this to my Kindle as my son loves music and now he can listen to it on the kindle as well!  Other than the ""Pop and Hip Hop Power workout"" station playin OLDIES (not sure why this is) I have no issues and love Pandora!"
Pandora,Pandora is a great app for music play,BRK,10-Nov-15,4,Pandora is a great app for music play. Upside is that you can create any list you want .... down side is that there is not enough different music added to your selected playlist type.
Pandora,All My Genre,Kludge,13-Sep-13,5,"This is really great sound.What a concept!  Just start a station off and it keeps adding same genre songs.Tired of that genre, start another station off and it keeps building, too.Tomorrow want some of the same, then maybe something different, start another station, or start an old one.Thumbs down those songs you don't want and they are gone.  Thumbs up those to tweak the selections of the future songs.Great deal, and no advertisements.I definitely recommend!"
Pandora,I like the service but find the app not very intuitive ...,Amazon Customer,16-Feb-16,4,I like the service but find the app not very intuitive in terms of use. Perhaps a link to instructions on how best to set up your own channels would be helpful.
Pandora,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain",Norman R,10-Dec-12,3,"I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
Pandora,Five Stars,Rodney Phillips,16-May-17,5,Just love it
Pandora,Five Stars,Vincent Frese,2-Jun-16,5,Very good
Pandora,Is awesome.. Its great to hear songs you remember ...,Alice B.,25-Apr-16,5,"Every song I choose or radio artist..Is awesome..Its great to hear songs you remember as a Rockin young person,and is just as fun now to listen!"

Pandora,love it.,William Ayres,3-Dec-16,4,"at first it didnt work right, cork left in bottle, however now it works perfectly.  love it."
Pandora,What happened?,Shannon R.,24-Aug-13,2,I've only had this app for a week and already problems! Worked like a charm until I had it exactly one week then it refused to load further than the blue Pandora screen! I completely removed it deleted the purchase and downloaded again for it to only do the same thing the next day! I hope this is just a bug that can be worked out because I love Pandora!
Pandora,Highly Recommended,Mortimer,20-Jul-16,5,"I have been using Pandora Radio for years, I love the stations I have created and I'm always surprised at the song choices they suggest, hidden treasures or forgotten favorites!"
Pandora,Music,Tom J Schill,15-Dec-16,5,I enjoy the selection of music gendra.  I turn on Pandora and listen all day to the music
Pandora,Great App,Blueyezgirlie,14-Jan-13,5,I use the app all the time. Works great on my phone and Tablet. Can't live without it! Easy to install and free!
Pandora,Simply Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!,Sukey,17-Nov-12,5,"Pandora app is the best!  If you love music and you simply want some relaxation music or want to get up and dance, Pandora has it all.  The sound on the Kindle Fire HD is simply a knock out.  Cannot believe that sound comes out of that thin piece of amazement!!!!  Truly, I recommend getting the full version of this app.  It is not much and is totally worth it.Thanks to Pandora and amazon.com."
Pandora,Pandora!,Hattsfam,29-Mar-13,5,"I have the free version.  Every now and then it asks if you are still listening and/or you hear a few ads, but I don't find it annoying enough to upgrade and pay monthly for it.  The genre picked does tend to play the same songs over and over, but there are many options to choose from and change the genre playing to change up the songs whenever you want. Can't beat it for free!!??"
Pandora,Good App,Got2bfree,3-Jun-16,4,Good App

Pandora,Best Music Player out there!,Mike Enriquez,26-May-16,5,I love that I get to listen to whatever I want whenever I want. The music quality is as good as I want to make it. PANDORA is EXCELLENT!
Pandora,What a waste of,Eric J.,1-Aug-15,1,"Stopped working immediately and had to call Pandora.  Next use was equal to one song at a time. After screwing with it for way too long, just changed to a different streaming program.  What a waste of time"
Pandora,love it,Ida Hudson,31-Jan-13,5,"well you cant go wrong with Pandora in the first place. Awesome music, the lyrics to sing by and easy to use"
Pandora,nothing evil in THIS box!,Bun-Bun Baxter,1-Aug-15,4,"Being able to pick ""stations"" for your favorite music means very little you dislike, though Pandora limits the number of pieces you can skip through, and there are ads unless you pay to avoid them."
Pandora,Five Stars,Mark Cusenz,27-Sep-17,5,"I Love It !!! Listen all day at work, makes the day a whole lot easier !!"
Pandora,I want to stop my subscription,juan,23-May-17,1,I want to cancel the subscription to stop the payment and it won't let me
Pandora,The internet music standard - for good reason,PghDrake,20-Mar-13,5,"This app has always made advances with internet radio and doesn't disappoint.  It's very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection (as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course).  You can set up your own channels and listen to everything from rock to classical to comedy bits.An excellent app that everyone should have, in my opinion.-D"
Pandora,Love using Pandora,Bethany,29-Nov-16,5,Love using Pandora. It has great variety and I am able to even hook into it on my cable box.
Pandora,Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like,Amazon Customer,10-Mar-16,3,Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like. The only problem is it has loading problems. It can take a long time to start the next song.
Pandora,Very Happy,C. Fernandes,29-Jan-17,5,I am a big fan of Pandora and listen to it often. The app works very well.and was free.
Pandora,Five Stars,Austin,23-Jan-17,5,"Fun to create your own ""stations"" and Pandora does well in selecting the tunes."

Pandora,Pandora Media,Vernell Sullivan,23-Jan-14,5,I have just applied Pandora and really do like it.  I plan to utilize this item to a great extent.
Pandora,Pandora with Bose Mini Bluetooth Speaker! Wonderful,mike toscano,8-Jan-14,4,Always enjoy my Pandora. Now that I have a mini Bose blue tooth speaker it's even better.I listen tall all my favorite channels at home and now at work.I have the premium Pandora with no commercials. It's wonderful.Mozart to Joe Walsh to Muddy Water. What a way to listen to uninterpreted music all day long.
Pandora,great streaming music...,Marc Albin,20-Feb-16,5,"I love my Pandora, it is the best next to amazon music... I use it all of the time, it helps me when I am cleaning keeps me going... Wide variety of music..."
Pandora,Ads cost Pandora a !!!,Amazon Customer,22-Nov-16,4,"Four stars because of advertising, would be better without ads and no charge to remove them !"
Pandora,Very Nice,suitedzombie,15-Nov-15,4,"Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)"
Pandora,Works But Nothing is Free,Amazon Customer,22-Oct-15,2,"You don't get something for nothing.  This works but I've read that it enables personal information to be sent to the company about your habits, contacts, pictures, etc.  I took it off."
Pandora,love it,Amazon Customer,27-Feb-14,4,"Awesome app. Really wish the kindle version didn't take off the sleep timer though. I miss that feature, can't fall asleep to the music anymore because I have to wake up to turn it off. Sigh. Other than that I love this for everything else. Music is in everything I breathe and Pandora almost always plays my moods."
Pandora,Five Stars,Lannette,18-Jul-17,5,I love me some PANDORA would not change for anything unless it's better.
Pandora,Wonderful!!!,Ardie,16-Apr-14,5,So enjoy the variety and easy of use.  I carry it with me and it helps me keep working. Thanks!!!!
Pandora,went wrong since last update -.-,Amazon Customer,3-Nov-15,2,"Last update does not allow you to stop playing your music, stop playing, skip a song, nor like or dislike it unless you are inside the app. Plus it stops playing by itself randomely."
Pandora,One Star,broron,18-Jul-17,1,Don't know they would not except my account.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,24-Aug-17,5,Good
Pandora,Pandora is awesome. It is free music,Trey,7-Apr-15,4,"Pandora is awesome. It is free music. Type in a song, album or artist and you get that plus similar music. And its all for free? I use it for Moon Hooch and Mickey Avalon radio. Better than radio, satellite and Youtube for music."
Pandora,The app does what it is meant to do,Benjamin Thomas Rath,25-Feb-15,4,"The app does what it is meant to, open a direct link to your Pandora account. It doesn't do anything else because it doesn't have too. You could accomplish the same effect by creating a short cut, but I find this slightly more convenient."
Pandora,1st app,Reader in the Midwest,14-Jul-13,5,This was my 1st app on my new KFHD & I love it. The device has good speakers & w/Pandora you can program your favorites. Wish there were no audio ads but the app was free so why complain?! I had to go to Amazon's Kindle support to figure out where it was on my KFHD once I downloaded it but that's not the fault of the app. Pleased to have it & esp at no cost.
Pandora,pandora,Nancy Weimer,29-Aug-13,5,I love the pandora.  It's easy to use and works great.  I would yell anyone that ask me that they will love it.
Pandora,Five Stars,Me,24-Aug-14,5,Greatest ever
Pandora,Really enjoyed the new app,William,17-Sep-15,5,"Really enjoyed the new app, as my wife has been using Pandora for years now.  I love the various categories of music which allows you to play tailor towards your favorites.  I waited too long."
Pandora,Pandora is amazing -- a huge value in my life!,Andrew Cohen,1-Jan-15,5,"I love their service of providing super music all the time.  I love these dedicated stations of mine.  The three main ones are early classical (when I'm working), piano jazz when I'm doing light tasks and driving, and classical guitar while dining."
Pandora,Great music,Amazon Customer,13-Sep-16,5,"Constant good music, always accessible, for all occasions! Makes it enjoyable to listen all day a and night."
Pandora,I liked the music but it took over my phone and ...,Marlenia P.,8-Apr-16,2,"I liked the music but it took over my phone and would not let me turn it off. I had to contact mayday to fix it, then I removed it from my phone."
Pandora,One Star,Amazon Customer,2-May-17,1,"Not available in South Africa, such a pity!"
Pandora,commercials,Tom M.,28-Mar-14,4,"Music is great, but nothing in life is free. A few to many commercials. Some times I struggle to find stop button. They call it quit"
Pandora,Pandora on Kindle is a great combination.,Bryan C Seymour,9-Dec-13,5,"Pandora has become my go to place to experience new music. I'm still old school enough to find an artist I like and then buy the CD (soon I'll be buying the vinyl). The Pandora app runs great on my Kindle Fire, so now I find myself doing more ""music research"" when laying in bed before I turn the lights out for the night."
Pandora,I love it,Linda K.,31-Jan-17,5,"Although I basicly stay on one channel it is awesome, they always play the best songs"
Pandora,I enjoy listening to the mix of music that happens as ...,Whits End,31-Dec-14,5,"I enjoy listening to the mix of music that happens as Pandora interprets my likes and dislikes.  It is very easy to use, easy to pick your own type of music, and easy to say 'I don't like that' when something is introduced that grates on my nerves."
Pandora,Not as good,Dennis M. Philpot,29-Dec-16,3,It used to be a lot better.  They still play good music but have too many commercials
Pandora,Four Stars,Marvin R.,7-Jan-17,4,"I guess after you get good with it, it may be good. Until then it is quite difficult."
Pandora,"Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many ...",Josh,5-Sep-16,2,"Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. There's way better options out there."
Pandora,Five Stars,Emmanuel Dada,3-Jun-16,5,Great
Pandora,"Great Music, more choices,",Charlotte Ragan,7-Dec-13,5,It works for me.  I love it.  I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music.  Some also use it.  I'm 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio.  There is less music on the car radio then ever before.  I like having choices and with Pandora you do.
Pandora,Freedom to listen to the songs you really love,Sunflower,28-Jan-14,5,"I like that I can select the songs and artists that I like to listen to, and I can give songs it ads that are similar a thumbs up or down.  Also I can listen to Pandora while I play games on my Kindle fire. Thanks to my grandson for telling me about Pandora as he also uses it, and he showed me how to use it.  Love it."
Pandora,Awesome customizability yall,Amazon Customer,7-Jul-16,5,Love this app.  I know its been around for years now but I just decided to check it out.  Love customizing my own stations.
Pandora,Pandora service,Little Al,1-Apr-14,4,I enjoyed using this program until they raised the price of the service. It is a one of a kind program  because I could develope the music folks I listen to most offen. Now I just stream the general music I like. The Pandora music program is still free to use but with advertising coming on every so often.
Pandora,Love it!,neffy,9-Oct-13,5,"I didn't realize how much I would enjoy the Pandora app. I carry my Kindle from room to room or out on the porch and have constant, great music that I like. No more tuning in a radio. Really like that it identifies the artist - there are songs I've heard before but didn't know who was singing. Just this app alone makes the Kindle worth it!"
Pandora,This is a really good product.,Louise Bishop,8-Jun-13,4,"I like this very much.  Its a little hard to figure out how to work it.  Are there any instructions?  Don't know where they are.  But the fact is once you get it started, its really terrific.  The music fits my choices exactly.  They know what I like better than I do. Very enjoyable on my Kindle Fire. Nice to make good use of really good sound on the Kindle Fire."
Pandora,Broken app no longer!,Pat Krave,8-Aug-15,5,Thank you for fixing.  We are going back to 5 stars.  PANDORA!!!  Have you even noticed the comments since your last update?  Hope you are working on a fix.  Thanks for bringing me music before that.
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,7-Jan-17,4,"love it so far, still trying to learn what it can do and understand how to do things"
Pandora,Best music station ever,Devin,22-Jul-15,5,I Downloaded Pandora on my Kindle and instantly fell In love. I work on the beach and this is my go to app for music from every genre. I love how it let's you create your own station. At anytime you can pick up my Kindle and Pandora will be on.

Pandora,Pandora gets 5 stars for classical selections!,Carol Wordsmith,8-Mar-16,5,"For Christmas, 2015, I received a great gift of a Kindle Fire tablet, as well as a really nice headset.. I recently discovered Pandora and was very pleased with the site. I e;njoyed exploring Pandora and setting up ""stations"" for future listening. I am most impressed with the classical selections on Pandora. I know I will come back to the site over and over to see what's new."
Pandora,It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable,Berniece SKinner,5-Nov-15,5,We listened to Pandora all the way from Oregon to Palm Springs instead of Sirius.  It was absolutely amazing and so enjoyable.  And let's not forget how much less expensive it is.

Pandora,"Pandora is a great app, although I prefer I Heart Radio, as it doesn't need Wi-Fi.",Leifur Castle,27-Jan-16,5,"Pandora is a great app, although I prefer I Heart Radio, as it doesn't need Wi-Fi.  I am able to create stations and playlists of my favorite music, which allows me to simply click on my favorite Irish playlists, and hear my favorite drinking songs!  I love this app!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,22-Aug-17,5,"So far so good with setting up, selecting, and playing."
Pandora,short amount of time,Vicki hartman,1-Jan-14,5,"In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy.  Now I just need the time to go back for more.  I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!"
Pandora,Pandora will not allow me to get in.,Amazon Customer,23-May-17,1,"Says ""unable to play music"" ALL the time.  Vary disappointed."
Pandora,Good stuff,jw,20-Nov-15,5,I live this .. I don't listen to the radio very much but this is wonderful to have. I can determine what will be my regular songs & what will be the songs I don't want to hear
Pandora,"Love, love",Phred Phlintstone,5-Aug-16,5,"Love, love, love having someone else choose music for me. I pick a style I want to hear, and Pandora does the rest."
Pandora,Pandora application for Kindle,Bill Phillips,24-Mar-13,5,One of the main reasons for buying my Kindle Fire was so I could listen to Pandora in my house through my stereo and also out in my shop through another stereo. It works very well. It is not quite as user friendly as the one on my Macbook but I think with a little time I will learn new tricks and shortcuts. I am very happy with it overall and very grateful to get it for free.
Pandora,All you need.,Frenchie ..thats all you get,13-Sep-16,5,"Almost anything you want. Even ...Mother's of Invention...best part.. No messing around start it ,it plays"
Pandora,Good buy,Eldon,6-Sep-17,4,Avail on many devices. Good selection of stations. Easy access. So far no problems.
Pandora,Overall,Jan Morrow,11-Sep-17,4,Overall - Great.  Could use a little more material.  Start to hear several repeats.
Pandora,Too many ads,adpanda,3-Aug-15,3,"Good music, like being able to select favorites and skip songs, but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
Pandora,Five Stars,BJR,3-Jan-15,5,"Really happy with this app.  Add stations then shuffle, couldn't be easier to customize the music."
Pandora,Five Stars,Takisha,2-Dec-16,5,I enjoy having music that I create playlist stations for at my disposal. Love this app!
Pandora,Great app,michelle mogavero,16-Apr-15,5,"Awesome app. Free version works great. If you don't mind the commercials every now and then, I see no reason to purchase the paid version. Great for getting to know similar or new bands that relate to bands you already know."
Pandora,good games or not,the AWESOME GAME EVER,26-Dec-15,5,This is technically an app but this is amazing if you like music and if you're always busy and want to listen to music when you're doing something.... I LOVE THIS APP
Pandora,Love it,Lovely Day,4-Sep-17,5,Love the selection of music
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,4-May-17,5,excellent music. use a lot.
Pandora,not what I expected,F. J. Goslin,9-May-14,2,I'm sorry that I couldn't make this any better but it doesn't do what I thought it was supposed to do. I wanted to make a play list with an artist. But all this would do is play one selection by the artist and then it started playing other artists that I never heard of...not for me any longer...
Pandora,Like Pandora BUT..........,Amazon Customer,7-Mar-14,3,"I have had a Pandora account for a longtime but had not used it in quite a while.  When I downloaded it on my new Droid XX, I found it very annoying because the ads out number the music.  I found the monthly fee to avoid the ads to be twice as high as it should be.  In the past I paid $15 for a subscription."
Pandora,Great site!,Elias Hane,18-Jan-13,4,"Great site with extended and complete information about songs and artist.Unfortunetly too much advertisment, but the service is excellent."
Pandora,Pandora,Paul,15-Oct-16,5,Like it a lot lots of music choices and really easy to use very happy with it don't change a thing
Pandora,Pandora Music App,Brian Clausen,18-Mar-14,5,This is an awesome App to purchase if you are looking for a music App that learns as you check whether you like the song it plays at the time. You can create individual band name folders and click thumbs up or thumbs down to make your selection for that individual band you have named each folder you are listening to. It learns as you make your selections and narrows the music it plays until it eventually plays nothing but the band name you picked for each folder. If you want to narrow your search even more you can create folders for specific album names for the band you select. I very highly recommend this App.
Pandora,Replaces XM radio,Buk Wyrm,16-Mar-14,5,This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm.
Pandora,Love pandora!!!!,Katrinka Rosado,17-Apr-14,5,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to Pandora. I can listen to any of my favorite artists anytime, anyplace day or night. It is such a great way to carry my favorite music with me anywhere. Get on board. Its' a must have.!!"
Pandora,Pandora plays great music based on your choice of performers,Janet Gray,24-Jun-16,5,I am a music lover. Pandora plays great music based on your choice of performers. Songs played that I hadn't heard in years.

Pandora,One good and free app from Amazon Market for BB 10,Sambosia,5-Nov-14,4,I used to have Apollo (Pandora Radio Client) on my Blackberry playbook and got used to it especially it got no advertisement.  Now with Pandora I got the same good music but ads are there.  It works great on my Blackberry Passport and I highly recommend it.
Pandora,Great App,Cyndi Nelson,26-Apr-13,5,This is a great app for those who love music.  Works great on any device and I is easy to use.
Pandora,Five Stars,Marcia Rocksund,3-Jan-17,5,NICE TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT I LISTEN TO!
Pandora,PANDORA APP for polaroid tablet,Amazon Customer,1-Dec-12,1,I use this app on all my devices and I bought a polaroid 8 in tablet for both of my children for christmas.  I decided to open one to test it out and this app doesn't work.  It loads but never plays the music. It just constantly changes the song and never plays.  I deleted and re-downloaded the app and the same thing happened.  I will open the other tablet on christmas and see if it works then.
Pandora,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,29-Jul-17,3,It doesn't offer what I thought it would
Pandora,Pandora is terrific,Troy L Pritt,14-Jun-16,5,I like the idea of selecting my own music. It is free. If I like an album I can buy it on Pandora. The variety is outstanding.
Pandora,it is so cool it is easyer then going to youtube when you are in a rush,Kindle Customer,2-Nov-17,5,I love it you should try it so time all it need in a phone and it is easy like 123
Pandora,Rock with Classic Rock on Pandora!,Amazon Customer,24-Jan-17,5,Pandora has my music choices and really like to send it on the bluetooth speakers.
Pandora,"Before You Buy It, Wait.","It is a cool game, well it looks cool At least, it will not download on my kindle fire and its annoying me.",14-Jan-14,2,I bought this by reading the great comments and every single time that I login and just keep it on I actually try to just click it and when I do it says loading and it won't go on. Multiple times I download it again and it works the first time and after that it does the same things. This is now my 7th time getting it.
Pandora,Five Stars,Henrietta Herriott,14-Aug-17,5,Great station
Pandora,Two Thumbs Up !,Caroline,18-Sep-14,5,"A big fan of free radio.  Could do with less commercials, but I love the customization options it offers.  One bug fix I would love to see though, is that on the Kindle Fire HD it won't work with other apps open, even the Silk browser.  Other than that, it's perfect!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Cammy,15-Aug-14,5,We love the variety of music and the ability to choose genres.
Pandora,Love my Country music!,Betty,26-Jun-14,5,Decided it would be easier to take my music with me this way versus a radio.  Downloaded the free app and listened to it on 3 nights to fall asleep with my country music.  I already have it on my Android smartphone but it drains my battery when I use it on there.  It works fabulously.
Pandora,Glitchy on the Kindle Fire HD...,P. Hartung,22-Apr-13,3,"Love pandora as a service and use across other devices as well, but this app needs to be smoothed out for the kindle fire HD.  It often won't shut off (or become mute) when closing the cover, and it also hampers the use of other apps while running simultaneously.It's free, and I trust they'll work out the flaws eventually.  Until then it gets three stars..."
Pandora,Enjoy very much!,GraceLee,29-Mar-16,5,Listen to every day.  Use the alarm clock to wake with music
Pandora,Blues Addict for life.,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-16,5,Love my Blues entertainment every night and playing it with my guitar.
Pandora,Music is so Universal!,Jenice,31-Dec-12,5,"I have an ecclectic taste in music and love my Budha Bar station and chill stations as well as, my New Age Instrumental and other things as well, like Ambient, Dance Electronic or Smooth Jazz. such good stuff!I am a soft skills and technical trainer and play Pandora during my participants breaks and through lunch. The class often asks about the music and where can they get it!"
Pandora,great music app,llindalu,9-Dec-14,4,Love the convenience and variety.  Wish site was easier to navigate however perhaps it's just me.  I have an old I pod on a player that now thanks to Pandora provides all the best music in my sewing room where good radio reception was not available.

Pandora,"I use it every day, on my phone and ...",Brittney Franks,14-Jun-15,3,"I use it every day, on my phone and on my computer at work, but it's gotten to the point where the ads are getting to be too much. I briefly considered going to ad free listening. But last year it was $3.99 a month, and now it's bumped up to $4.99 a month. Uh... no thank you."
Pandora,Great app,Tanya s.,8-Jun-15,5,I love Pandora.. The fact that I can choose what I want to listen to and subscribe for commercial free music for such a cheap price is awesome... Satellite radio is expensive and you don't get to choose anything

Pandora,Can listen to my favorite songs!,D. Roach,7-Nov-13,5,Love it because I just type in an artist I like and it somehow knows what other artist I like and I can listen to it without many ads at all. I can shuffle my stations and listen to all the music genres I like together . The only thing I don't like is it plays too many live versions of songs and I'd rather hear the studio version.
Pandora,on all my devices and Roku too!,Glen T Roberts,7-Jul-14,5,"Love my Pandora radio! I have several radio stations I have created that did t my changing desires in music.

Pandora,Lots of music fun!,Ollie,16-Jun-13,5,"Fast download and used right away. It immediately played songs that I love and new songs to add to my favorites. I appreciate the option to ""like"" and ""dislike"" songs so that Pandora can track what kind of music I want to listen to and create better playlists. Commercials are not big deal. How else would you get this great music app for free?"
Pandora,Perfect,Stephanie,19-Mar-14,5,I love Pandora as i can customize my own station.  I can also make multiple stations for those days when I want to listen to Country and the other days where I need a little spiritual music in my ear.

Pandora,Music your way,Javan W. Marks,4-Aug-13,5,"It deserves a 5 star rating because there is nothing out there like it. could there be some improvements now that i have experienced for years now, yes. but they are very small.

Pandora,"Good, but unfortunate commercials",AHW,13-Mar-14,3,"I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I don't like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear.

Based on my keep or reject choices, Pandora will then send me a song according to my interest, If I don't like the next song I reject it and they won't ever play that song again. Eventually you build your own station and can share your music with others. It a keeper"

Pandora,New listener,Ed,7-Apr-13,5,I enjoy the freedom of listening to music types I like through my cellphone or computer. Overall I enjoy listening to the artist I choose and the simular artists. I would prefer though a little heavier emphasis on my chosen artist within the mix. I was introduced  to Pandora by my daughter a few weeks ago and have very much enjoyed the listening experience. Thank you.
Pandora,Works great on the Fire TV Stick,Ryan,17-Aug-16,5,Works great on the Fire TV Stick. Less complicated to use than Pandora app through my tablet and Chromecast.
Pandora,"Good, but has a mind of it's own.",Kindle Customer,10-Aug-16,3,"I love that I can find the stations I am in the mood for.  It's easy to use.  The reason for only 3 stars is that I have it installed on my phone, and sometimes it kicks on by itself.  It doesn't matter if I'm at work, or school or in the middle of the night.  I won't be using my phone and all of a sudden I start hearing music. Since I always have my volume up so I can hear my phone, when Pandora comes on, it is loud!  If that were fixed so it wouldn't randomly start playing, I would give it 5 stars."
Pandora,_Ÿ˜Å,Amazon Customer,26-Jun-16,4,I already loved this app. Only problem I have with it is when it keeps losing signal when it's sitting in the same spot.

When I want easy listening, that's what I get.  I choose thumbs up or down for each piece of music, and the station gives more of the type I want.  There are commercials, but they are fewer than a local radio station."
Pandora,pretty good,bingo girl,2-May-15,3,"I find it fun to listen to. It does use up your battery pretty fast though. Also, is regularly skips songs when I don't want it to. Also, it signed me up for pandora one all by itself and I don't know how to get out."

Pandora,Not as useful as I'd hoped it would be,Liz,9-May-14,3,"This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I'm out I'm more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I'm at home I'm more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it's easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I'm out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app doesn't get much use on the Kindle."
Pandora,great music app,bobbie jo hogue,29-Aug-15,5,Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before.
Pandora,How annoying. I used to love this,demi lauren,20-Aug-15,2,More and more commercials. Put on ambient music for my infant and the commercial came on and startled him because of how abruptly loud it was. How annoying. I used to love this application
Pandora,Don't mind it!,a person,25-Nov-14,5,"The only negative thing, to me, about this app is that I don't get exactly what song I want, but I don't mind it! It makes think about new music! I love it so much! I would recommend this app to all people who love music and like to break molds!"
Pandora,Great Music (because you choose it yourself),Elizabeth,10-Oct-12,5,"I have a very eclectic mix on my station (I subscribe to PandoraOne, but the app is a free download); you can give a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" on any song, and, if you don't like it, will probably not hear anything too much like it again.  I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."
Pandora,Pandora alows yo to hearb YOUR music!,Barry  Gates,15-Jul-16,5,Great way to get a great mix of your music anywhere!

Pandora,"Great idea, not so great execution.",Oliver Wu,16-Nov-13,3,"I like Pandora a lot, but it tends to shut down or freeze frequently. I does on my phone, iPad and computer. To be honest I am looking to replace it. I think the layout is awesome and they have a great concept but the ""bugs"" are annoying!"
Pandora,I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal),Mark,13-Dec-14,5,"I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL"
Pandora,hard to access,purpleswan,17-Jan-14,2,I love being able to listen to music but the program is very difficult to understand how it works. There are not very clear instructions on how to get the type of music I like and put it all into a stream so I can listen. I don't want to have to have a tab for each song but rather a stream of constant music.
Pandora,Nice to have when doing my projects around the home-just ...,James T. Duke,23-Nov-14,5,"Have used it at home for quite a while, now I use it with my Fire phone and Bluetooth to a Bose wireless speaker.  Nice to have when doing my projects around the home-just pick what channel I'm in the mood for and let her play the tunes. .  . ."
Pandora,I've had Pandora forever but am just getting acquainted,Lucylollipop,11-Apr-13,4,"I'm in love with this app!  I've got it on my phone, my tablet, the laptop and the desktop!! I shuffle my playlist and that's all I need to do.  I plan to cancel my Netflix subscription since I really don't use it as often as I've been using Pandora and subscribe to Pandora to get rid of the commercials ( they're not bad but I just prefer to be commercial free)"
Pandora,Pandora Review (free version),WR450f_09,31-Oct-13,4,"Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.Pros:-free-offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in-there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations-easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button-they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes-if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons:-commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded-not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener-rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."
Pandora,Four Stars,Alexa gross,20-Dec-16,4,Love Pandora. Wish that you could skip more songs when you want to though.

Pandora,Pandora,Confused Southpae,29-Dec-12,5,"Maybe I'm being too generous. I've had no experience with this app on other platforms, so I can't make comparisons.  I just know iWork's as advertised, much better clarity than normal radio, and less commercials. I think the options for creating your own stations are great, and I've been introduced to new music that fits my selected genre that I never would have found on my own."
Pandora,it can be better,awesome,7-Aug-15,4,"I got this app and it works great, but once I get on the app I have to wait 10 min for it to load!! I would recommend spotify, because you can litsen to music you actually search for, and Pandora when I search for a song the real song does not come on it is a completely different song then what I search for therfor  GET SPOTIFY"
Pandora,Great addition to PC and Kindle,Jen,1-Oct-14,5,"I enjoy listening while I work on my desktop PC, and also on my Kindle.

Pandora,A radio station to fit every listener,Arledio Martins,20-Aug-13,5,"A very sophisticated way to listen to music. We can choose a style, a composer or a singer and listen at our own leisure. We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!"

Pandora,well...,Avid Reader,11-Aug-14,4,"Let's keep in mind this took FOREVER to come out. So, the time it was being established doesn't meet the all the bugs.

Pandora,Can't live without Pandora,Leah Schmidt,20-Feb-15,5,I credit my genre of music range to Pandora. Absolute genius. Users complain about limited skips and I see it as a benefit - sometimes you have to listen to the whole song to relate to it. I will forever follow Pandora.
Pandora,"I'd give it 10 stars, if I could.",Deborah Howard,10-Apr-15,5,It's user-friendly. And just the best thing ever.  My stations are the most diverse collection of artists you can imagine.

Pandora,Three Stars,JMurwin,23-Sep-16,3,It doesnt play a good variety of the artists i selected. It plays some songs a lot.
Pandora,it WAS awesome...,Fizzle Exmortus,7-Apr-13,4,"ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWCurrent version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs.  You have to register via email to use it now and It now has double the ads and they come in audio AND video form, usually in pairs or threes.  Recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month.  This means that, although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day, you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want.  This change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re-download it.  They also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile, facebook, and twitter.  You still won't get that perfect song in one go, but you won't run out of time waiting for it to queue up. It's still 3.99 for unlimited ad free music. I can't give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of Ads (I understand they have to do so to provide music for free, but they are going overboard) and the need to email register an account with them (sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming), but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn't mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks (like we used to do with the radio, before lime wire and kazaa)ORIGINAL REVIEW:It has a great selection and variety, almost no bugs, and tolerable ads.  However, recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month!  I could see an hour a day, but if you listen as often as I do, this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month. First week, tops.  This would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then, but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station, so you won't get that perfect song in one go, and if you wait to hear it you'll run out of time for the month.  Of course you can buy the 3.99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay .99 when your times up to keep listening for the month, but let's face it, this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer. Meanwhile, I'll be finding a new app."

Pandora,I like this much more than I thought I would,percy,3-Sep-15,5,"I like this much more than I thought I would!  I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly.  I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides.  Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data  that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data.  There are a ton of visual advertisements!!!  But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them.  I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."
Pandora,"Better than Slacker, in my opinion.",CopperHead,4-Dec-13,5,"I like this so much better than the Slacker app.  It just seems like Pandora is a lot better at picking music that I like instead of Slacker.

Pandora,Love Pandora on my Kindle,Granny O,18-Sep-13,5,I am really enjoying my Pandora App on my Kindle.  I love being able to choose the music I want to listen to and to have such a huge variety of artists and songs available to me!  Anyone that enjoys music and in all setting would enjoy the Pandora App.  I found Pandora very easy to navigate and make my choices.
Pandora,Radio your Way,Keywester,12-Jun-14,5,I like Pandora because you can use radio stations other people have set up or set up your own.  You can specify the artists and make a single radio station for that artist.  For a nominal fee it's a great tool and you can have fun making your own radio station available.
Pandora,Hell yeah,Stacey Bowling,20-Mar-17,5,My favorite app
Pandora,Pandora,W. Hutchings,9-Jan-13,5,"I love Pandora for my personal use.  It also offers great kids clean versions of songs, must be supervised by an adult of course as they can see what's in their parents favorite stations as well.  The only improvement I would like to see is being able to have a kids only version so if I'm not looking they can't accidentally select something inappropriate."
Pandora,I no longer download songs,Elisabeth Clements,20-Mar-13,5,"Since I started using Pandora on my phone 3mo ago, I haven't had the need to download any new songs. I feel like I have a Genius playlist that's great at mixing it up. I love also how I can customize my stations. The ads really don't bother me either so I wouldn't bother wasting my money for an ad-free experience for 3.99/mo or whatever it is."

Pandora,streams great,Amber,22-Apr-13,5,"I love this app. it has every kind of music you can imagine so no one will be unhappy. The quality of music is great. It works very well on my kindle and my android phone. The only draw back are the commercials and when it asks me if I'm still listening, which I understand why it does that. But with it being free I can't really complain."

Pandora,"Great for Gatherings, On the Road or Everyday Listening",C Grant,9-Dec-12,4,"Pandora is a great music player that allows you to play a variety music by genre, artist and even theme.  The functionality and ease of use are top notch. The only knock I have against it are the very intrusive audio ads.  These ads are the only deterrent to me listening more.  Even the pesky pop up ads are more bearable than the intrusive audio interruptions."
Pandora,I love Pandora than any other music app,Delicia Hudson,14-Jul-14,5,I love Pandora than any other music app. I have Pandora on my Tv and phone and I never have a problem with uploading to hear my favorite station.

Pandora,Its OK,Alaskanadian,9-Apr-14,3,"There are a lot os station formats, but you hear the same songs on a lot of the.

Otherwise, I really like Pandora."
Pandora,Wow it is radio my way!,Sheena Jennings,28-Jan-13,5,"Pandora is wonderful I have it everywhere, kindle, Directtv and iPhone. They are each geared to what I want on each one according to the location I use my units. I have tried similar apps and they were time consuming and took more patience than what I had to learn and use. Pandora is great, if you don't have it get it today! You will be glad you did."
Pandora,Great!,Marlene,4-Mar-13,5,I love pandora radio. first I love that its easy to use. Second the music is great you can put a artist or genre & it plays the songs .. what I also love is that you can search music from a certain time for example the 70's and it plays music exactly from that time only. I have found so many songs I have been looking for using pandora! Love it!
Pandora,Only thing we really listen to anymore,D. Mossor,5-Jan-14,5,"I found Pandora in 2008, and loved the idea so much I signed up for Pandora|ONE as soon as it was released.

Pandora,Awesome App!,Suzy Wegner,14-Jan-13,5,"I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD 7"", my Droid X smartphone and also on the computer.  It is the best ""free"" radio app on the market in my opinion because the more you listen and like certain songs that they play the more custom of a radio station you end up with. There are also not a lot of repeats which keeps things from getting boring."

Pandora,A decent way to get individualized music...,BORN TO READ,25-Oct-15,3,"Pandora offers a way to individualize songs you enjoy listening to while on the computer, phone, or tablet. It's easy to set up and use but I think Amazon Prime offers a better product; one reason being that they offer entire albums as well as individual songs to Prime members. You can't beat Amazon Prime!"
Pandora,app works well,amandahkr,24-Mar-14,3,"The app's function is fine. I've always loved Pandora, but it seems like over the last year or so,there are more commercials than music.

My one complaint is that to skip or pause songs you have to return to the app, possibly losing your place is you are doing something else.

Pandora,Pandora Media,Amazon Customer,27-Dec-12,4,I think this is a fabulous way to listen to music.  Love the radio station choices geared to one;s personal preferences as well as the cross references that lead from one liked singer or group to a similar one.  The only criticism I have is that the search mechanism does not include song titles.  It is necessary to know who recorded the song to find it.

It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app .

Pandora,Best music app,Scuba,7-Jun-13,4,Pandora is the best music app out there. Easy to understand and plays great songs. The one bad part is they limit ur free listening to 40 hours a month.

Time goes by so much quicker when you have music you enjoy listening to.  I get to decide if today will be pop, soft rock or country, or just music similar to some of my favorites.  I really enjoy picking the all 80's or all 90's stations and easing through my day with great music.  Pandora is SUPER and I am glad it is out there for me to enjoy.  And I am just now learning how extensive this media is and I look forward to hearing it ALL!"

I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is, $36 a year! I signed up, noticed the advertising gone, but more, since I had put some cash on the line, I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station. How do you go so seamlessly from Dixie Chicks, through Norah Jones and Steve Winwood, to Journey, with perfect song selection from each?! Really invigorating! I'm hooked!! Thank you Pandora! What a concept so well fulfilled!"

There will be ads telling me about the ""ad free"" listening I'm taking part in and I'm sure I don't have to explain why this irks me. There are also ads almost every time I skip a song or switch stations. Otherwise I love this app.  I have a station for pretty much any mood I have and a variety to cover whatever else I'd enjoy hearing. Favorite part is it's free.

Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing.

Pandora,Pandora -- not user friendly,MikeM,6-May-13,1,"I downloaded and installed Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I created a station and everything seemed to work fine. However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE."
Pandora,Five Stars,betty westermeyer,9-Oct-16,5,"i love it, can get all the really old songs , i am in 7th heaven"
Pandora,Sooner...,Elissa,16-May-14,5,"I don't know how I had ever survived without Pandora! I was a satellite radio fan until I moved to where I could not install the antenna properly to receive it. I was waiting for the right time to compile an MP3 collection, for years. But I was always more in love with the spontaneity of radio. You know something is really one of your favorite things if the only regret you have with it is why hadn't I discovered it sooner. I could have had so much more fun and so many less boring drives and so many less years of wondering when I was going to have the time and money to develop an extensive MP3 collection that would be able to come anywhere close to the # of my favorite songs that exist in the world. The thumbs up/thumbs down feature really is what you should pay attention to, because that is what really personalizes the station for you. You will be surprised how many new artists/songs that you might like that you may never have heard otherwise. I didn't even know i was interested in new artists until their style so logically followed my other old favorite styles of songs & artists. It's an ingenious system. So fun, so little work"
Pandora,Five Stars,theresa tirpak,9-Aug-16,5,"It's great ... I'm using it all the time..work, on the road and at night"
Pandora,It still great even if you don't pay,D.D.V,7-Mar-14,5,Pandora is amazing even with the fact if you skip a song you don't like it play a short ad but hey maybe those song might actually be good.

Pandora,You can't pick songs.,Daniel Allen,10-Apr-14,3,Good sounding music but you can't search for music you want to hear and play it.

Pandora,"Great music, hate the commercials!",Kindle CustomerSteve,9-Jun-16,4,The only problem is the stinking commercials. Other than that I like the program.
Pandora,Very Good Music Source,DenverJohn1,27-Mar-16,5,"Well it's Pandora. Works with many devices, always the music you create for a personal music experience."
Pandora,Pandora,Patscats,31-Dec-12,5,"I have had Pandora for about 4 years on my Internet Radio, Roku box & now on my Kindle. I am still amazed at the flexibility of Pandora, by  simply using the feedback system of ""Like or Dislike"" I have music that is truly my own. I have access to many radio stations through my Roku box but Pandora is always my first choice."
Pandora,I really enjoy listening to my music choices through my Kindle,Mary W. Plante,2-Nov-14,5,I really enjoy listening to my music choices through my Kindle. My music taste differs from that off spouse and that is putting it mildly. As long as I don't sing along it is all good when I use my ear buds.

Pandora,Enjoyable!,P. Williams,9-Dec-13,5,"Excellent so far, we are enjoying it.  We are using it to build a Christian Christmas station, and while it occasionally throws in an unusual offering, most tracks are right on target.  Our family is having fun with it, and the commercials aren't too frequent or annoying."
Pandora,very good but to many adds,honest helpfule feedback,10-Aug-14,4,To many adds I have deleted and waited for an update that would down grade the adds to ever so often I have muve music on my phone and I can download free music anytime with no adds so I like Pandora but to many friken adds.
Pandora,Nice,Jeffrey Busby,20-Jan-14,4,I really like the Pandora player.  The channels are very good at finding similar bands to the one you are searching for and plays a nice selection of music.  My only real complaint is the very limited number of skips that you get for the day even if you subscribe.
Pandora,Don't get,Daniel,21-Aug-16,5,It is good but it's like radio stations almost Spotify is better
Pandora,Interactive app. It learns as you go. In ...,Bill Yelley,8-Jun-16,5,Interactive app.  It learns as you go. In time you have a station for every mood.
Pandora,Freezes up meaning it spools to much,kelly,29-Mar-17,1,To many ads and spooling I'm sticking with Spotify free that has very few ads and no spooling
Pandora,Horrible,keante cooks,22-Mar-13,1,"They make it how you have to pay, going str8t To I Heart Radio, making you have to pay for OLD SONGS that they keep repeating please, that's why you don't hear about them anymore. I don't  understand people buying those ad free the premium? Doesn't make sense half of the songs i heard are in my car on a CD?!! Useless!"
Pandora,Four Stars,David,2-Aug-17,4,Pretty good music app.
Pandora,Works Greattt~,Kimbo,29-Dec-13,4,"The music plays even if I'm not in the app itself, which is great. But it's a pain to have to go back to the app to pause the song playing. But other than that, no problems besides that sometimes Pandora can't load all the way so it makes itself freeze for some reason"

Pandora,Wonderful program,ml,29-Jan-13,5,"If Pandora doesn't ruin itself by including too many commercials, it will remain one of the most important items in my life.  I love having Pandora.  And I know I have purchased a lot more music since I started listening to Pandora.  Yet, so much for free.  This program is an essential for anyone who loves to listen to music."
Pandora,Very Welcome addition to a great device,Robert K. Johnson,28-Mar-14,5,"Nearly Free, Great music. Perfect in Almost every respect eve  on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9""...I just wish I could pay as I go instead of the ridiculously low price of (I think only) of $99.00/year...But I live on my retirement SSI and $100.00 all at once is more than I can handle... So I feel slightly guilty listening... just slightly even though the commercial breaks are to my taste better than the usual ones... No Fund Drives either unlike the ""Commercial"" Stations or Public Radio that always hit between SSI checksGreat feature would be a senior account, Howeveri can see no way to void the inevitable fraud that is going to appear... Perhaps a select few stations, Classical and perhaps easy listening...R K. Johnson Sr.Robert K. Johnson Sr"

Pandora,Great music; Annoying ads,LaDeSpa,14-Apr-15,4,"Great music, but annoying ads unless you want to pay $4.99/month. Also, no directions, so can't figure out how to turn it off on my tablet without turning it off completely."

Pandora,Big Pandora Fan!,Debra Potts,14-Jan-17,5,"Love, love, love my Pandora.  Yes, I'm too cheap to pay for it, so I have to suffer commercials from time to time.  The subscription is not bad though.  I think it's around $5 (at least it used to be).  I love having this on my Kindle.  I can play it while I'm reading my online books.  I also frequently listen to it as go to bed.  It has a sleep timer which will shut it off so it doesn't play all night."
Pandora,So Awesome,frog lover,1-Sep-13,5,"I love this app! Listen to your fave artist! It has pop, rock, rap, country, you name it! You can play games at the same time too. Play  anything while listening to your tunes. Dance and sing to any artist on the planet!"

Pandora,bass/terb,Maddie,17-Mar-14,4,Ok so I think this all is like sooooo awesome but what it realy needs is some bass / terb positions cause on some of these songs I am all like this would sound so cool with the bass up or the terb up so I think it would make an already cool app cooler

Pandora,pandora equals awesome!!!!!!,Anastasia,18-Feb-13,5,This app is awesome .but if you only like a certain kind of song or songs this app is not for you.to get songs you'll probably like put in a band or person you most like the most. If you are getting this for your kid be warned some of the songs aren't in clean version so they will cuss.this app works great on kindle. :)
Pandora,Pandora,jcreece,5-Jun-14,5,"I love listening to Pandora and use it everyday, especially during my commute to and from work. I love that I can change the genre of my music.  I have not upgraded to the ad free yet, but would not mind having it without commercials."
Pandora,Two Stars,robert,25-Oct-16,2,"Would not down load into my NEW 8"" HD Fire"
Pandora,Awesome,Jessica,28-Sep-12,5,"I have no idea why everyone doesn't use this. It's an amazing way to create your own radio station. Far fewer commercials that traditional radio. You also get mostly the artists you ask for, but they will also throw in new stuff you've never heard before. I also like hearing some older songs that aren't played on the radio very often anymore."
Pandora,Best Internet Radio,ehall1972,30-Dec-12,5,"In my opinion this product beats all. I like the fact that I can select a band that I like, to create a station. Once it is started only bands that are in a similar genre are played. To be fair, the only other one I have tried was Slacker, and that was before I found Pandora. Once I found it I didn't need to look anywhere else."
Pandora,It's Pandora. What else can I say.,Shannon,20-Jul-15,5,It's Pandora.  What else can I say.
Pandora,"Good, but far behind the iPhone version.",Steven Porter,26-May-17,2,"This app is a joke compared to the iPhone version. Very little functionality is offered compared to iPhone (making playlists, streaming select songs, etc) This is the same as the current iPad app, which also lacks the new features."

Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,13-Jun-17,4,Great
Pandora,Great Radio app,Pbrk,15-Mar-13,4,I use Pandora on a few of my devices. I really like to use it when we have functions. The continous music with a commercial advertisement is still better than FM Radio in my local area.I can not upgrade app to latest upgrade for some strange reason.
Pandora,Pandora V.S Spotify,Oscar Cruz,18-Mar-15,3,"I think Pandora is a great app! Pandora has all the music you would want but, there is no playlists or personal music. In spotify you can create radio channels, you get recommended music, you can go to different genres of music and find specific music that you would enjoy. You can also save music to your own playlists and listen to it anywhere for free with no internet!"

Pandora,Pandora Rating,Ted Carpenter,18-Mar-14,5,"It was recommended by a friend.  I like to be able to mix/shuffle the stations in my list.  Would like to be able to listen to just one artist, but just haven't taken the time to sign up for the next level of Pandora.  Thanks for a great music site."
Pandora,Pandora is user friendly,Ann,19-Jul-16,5,"I've been using Pandora for 7 months. I've tried others, but the reason I like Pandora so much is my ability to tell it what kind of music I want to listen to....Some may say another internet radio station does that....well, if they do, they are user friendly enough for me to figure it out."
Pandora,Five Stars,Frank Bello,10-Aug-16,5,Pandora I like better than Sirius...cancelled my subscriptions.
Pandora,After the love has gone....,Dominique Tate,18-Jan-14,2,"When you first meet Pandora, you get a light headed feeling.  You think to yourself, ""Wow, finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of.  You two meet frequently; multiple times a day in fact.  You start dreaming of all the flexibility and new music you'd get introduced to.  You mess around with different combinations of songs, artists, themes, etc, until you realize something strange is happening!  You start to think the worst...is this too good to be true?  Have you been taken for a ride and abandoned in some place known as the loop, where all the music you clicked ""like"" to is constantly being played, even on stations that you would not expect to hear them on?  You start to panic and say, ""Well maybe the ""free"" version has limitations.  So you vacillate between paying for this somewhat weak service in the hopes of strengthen it or just abandoning it all together.  You take the plunge--pull out your credit card and go for broke, only to be deflated, dejected and sent into a downward spiral of self-pity and regret.  Why? Why Pandora Why?"
Pandora,I enjoy all the great music and opportunity of choice,Amazon Customer,5-Dec-15,4,I enjoy all the great music and opportunity of choice.. Ilove it and I recommend it to all my friends...thanks so much!

Pandora,Pandora is like the most popular radio station in the whole world ...,Kindle Customer,31-Jul-14,5,Pandora is like the most popular radio station in the whole world and it has all of my favorite songs on the app but the only thing I don't like about Pandora is that you can't skip how many songs you want there's a limit.
Pandora,Thoroughly enjoy Pandora.,Fred M. Turbeville,20-Aug-15,5,"Love Pandora!!  I've listened to it for past few years, and have multiple stations set up.  The occasional commercials do not bother me at all."
Pandora,The best radio app out there!,DKD,19-Dec-14,4,"This is the best radio app ever! Great music, you can mix-and-match songs. The only thing is that it does not have the latest songs, a lot of the songs are the older ones but still very good!!!"
Pandora,Music app not what I would use again,Len J.,18-Mar-16,3,"I understand developers want money. It's business. What I want is some reasonable privacy when I run an app. I like music. There are FREE apps that do a nice job, some with too many ads but many that certainly don't need my email address or login to operate. Pandora isn't one of these. It might well be a premium music app but in terms of what it wants... it's not for me.Slick interface that installs smoothly and runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. Fast download took forever to install. Why? TUNE IN is just as effective, annoyingly too many intrusive ads, but free and no login required."
Pandora,awsome,Jamilette Rivera,30-Jul-14,5,i love to lisen to music and pandora does the job for real i know what  not in and what is because its a radio and i put on sreach station and u put todays hit music and that will keep u up with the music today just awsome
Pandora,Love Pandora. I love all the choices of stations,Amber,19-Aug-14,5,"Love Pandora.  I love all the choices of stations, artists, genres and the ability to mix and match etc.  The only thing I wish I could do was listen to it in my old car, but I only have unlimited streaming at home. :("

Pandora,Four Stars,Deborah Clark,17-Jul-16,4,Great selection but they have started repeating songs too frequently
Pandora,LOVE IT!,Ms Thea,31-May-15,5,Oh I am so happy with this service.  I can create my own channels and use my phone to listen in the car.  I thinkit is as good or better than the paid services.
Pandora,A little more annoying then useful,Tm,27-Mar-14,3,"I wanted to be able to make my own personalized music experience, but end up skipping around a bunch to get to a decent song, or just going to Youtube instead. It seems when I choose an artist for a channel, that artist gets played like once a day. Sometimes I get music I don't like and that aren't even close to the channels artist, and when I down vote them I keep getting more of their songs. The ads are annoying too, to say the least. It could be much better, but they have to pay their bills somehow. I will from now on just buy my own songs instead.Pros: free music, a variety of music, introduces you to new songs or artists you may like.Cons: very limited, not very big on custom tuning the channels to your preference, intrusive ads every other song, irrelevant songs often."
Pandora,I wouldn't give one star if I had the option,Christina Burklund,7-Dec-14,1,This app will start to play a station then it will have another music station overlapping the first. I tried updating. Did not work. I tried un installing. Not working again. This app needs work.
Pandora,Best free music available on the web,Ted A. Mcelroy,12-Aug-14,5,Best free music available on the web.  I have it now on my smart TV's and my Smart Phone and computer.  Who needs to pay Sirius XM over $100.00 per year to hear their choices when you can select your choices at Pandora.
Pandora,What did we do before Pandora!,Sandra Anne Riva,4-Apr-13,5,This is an amazing service - You are not limited to a certain style of music and have virtually every type of music at your finger tips - Therefore Pandora is suitable for any age group or taste in music. . . One can even have numerous different stations depending on your mood of the day . . . . .Bravo Pandora!

This only improvement I can suggest it to let you have the option of build a radio of ONLY your favorite artist(s) like I tunes does. Paying for that feature would be fine.

I use pandora on my media box at home and I love it so I was really hoping to use it on my kindle. :-(
Pandora,It's better with subscription,parkranger,26-Dec-13,5,It is so much better just buying the subscription so no commercials are played and the sound quality is awesome. I play it just about anywhere I can. i did love the sleep setting but the last update has removed it (Or I just can't find it on the new home page).
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Tabitha  Larson,17-Jun-13,5,"Love Pandora. Sound quality is great! If you already have a Pandora account, you will be able to use this with ease. If not, this app also makes it easy to get started creating stations based on the types of music or artists you like. And all for free!! Who can argue with free. Would recommend!!"
Pandora,Limited,Liliana Piegari,1-Mar-16,1,I had to use Spotify instead because it didn't let me download the app in Argentina. Ridiculous.

Pandora,Don't get it,debbie,16-Aug-13,1,"I really don't get this app. While trying to listen to music, different songs would start playing and I couldn't shut it off. Very dangerous, if you have kids don't let them use this app, as you don't know what song will turn on. I immediately deleted this app minutes after buying it."
Pandora,Four Stars,Stephen Mitchell,13-Oct-17,4,Loving the music!
Pandora,Good as far as it goes,Bill,8-Dec-13,4,"Good selections tied to one's choice of artist, although one would like more controlafter a first extended listen.  A thumbs up for a song tends to spread the choices even more, asit increases the branching ""links"" rather than narrow the range."
Pandora,Easy radio,Whitneyfer,16-Nov-16,5,In my opinion Pandora is the best radio place to have. I use it more than my actual phone music.

Pandora,I love that amazon has apps to download,LuvMyAmazon,2-Mar-16,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download. The  apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"
Pandora,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,18-May-16,3,"Pandora needs to play more of the artist that I choose, not only random people"
Pandora,slow uploading,Winfred crowe,23-Aug-13,5,"I have Pandora on my Roku box for my tv and I enjoy it very much, on my Kindle I can't get it to operate, ther doesn't seem to be any instructions.

Pandora,"Love the music, but wish the ads were softer",Joules,30-Jan-16,4,"I love being able to play music at night while rocking the baby, but I hate that the volume of the ads are so much louder than the music that it wakes him up. The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me.  Just how loud they are.  I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies.  That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."
Pandora,good alternative,Amazon Customer,31-Jul-15,5,Good alternative to SiriusXM and if using a bloothtooth speaker you can stream through your phone using wyfi; cost is just to charge you phone.

I love this app because it saves your stations so when  you come back to it you can continue listening to your station, or change it to a station you've saved before, or easily create a new station! This app is great for the whole family! My kids (12, 10, 4 & 2) all love music and use this app frequently. It's easy to use and easy to change stations so even my 2 year old knows how to turn on his favorite Disney music. There are unlimited stations to search for so anything the kids want to hear they can find very easily. We even have different profiles set on each device so we can monitor what the kids can or cannot listen to, I love the parental controls so I don't have to worry about my  kids listening to bad music. We love everything about Pandora and will always use this app!!!"

Pandora,Serious problem with Kindle Fire HDX after installing Pandora,C Huson,7-Apr-14,1,"I don't install that many apps on my Kindle.  (I currently have Yahoo Mail, Adobe Reader, NewEgg, and U.S. Presidents installed.)I installed Pandora a week or so ago, the first app I installed in a couple months, and more as a lark than anything.  I love Pandora, and have it on my iPhone and my computer.  I listened for a few minutes, then paused it, went to the home screen, and then forgot about it.A few days later I opened my Kindle; Nothing happened.  I assumed the battery was drained.  I pressed the Power button a few seconds: it gave a little chime, nothing else.  I closed the Oragami case, hooked up the charger, and let it sit for twenty minutes.  Then I tried opening it.  Nothing.  I pressed the Power Button again, a little chime.  I waited half a minute and the lock screen appeared.  The indicator said 64% charged, so it had some charge the whole time.I tried unlocking the Kindle.  Nothing happened for about twenty seconds, then the unlock icon slid left and after a few more seconds the PIN screen appeared.  I entered my PIN, nothing.  Then after a few seconds the dots appeared, one a second or so, and the screen unlocked.  I pressed the Home Screen button, and after a few more seconds the Home Screen appeared.I got to the Apps section, and uninstalled Pandora.  I rebooted the Kindle, and everything was normal.  I have had no problems since I uninstalled Pandora.Maybe it was an interaction with Pandora, or maybe it runs in the background and got confused when I left my home WiFi network.  I am not sure what happened exactly, but when something radically unexpected happens I have to think it was the most-recent change that caused it, especially since my main use for my Kindle is reading books."
Pandora,Music,Everett A Slavey Jr,31-Dec-13,5,"This is a great concept for listening to music.  You get to pick the format, no DJ wasting time amusing themselves, and if you don't like the song you can reject it without having to change the channel!  You are completely in charge and it's FREE!"

I'm going to school online (while living in transitional housing), so I listen to Pandora as I work.  The music is from years gone by (and from movies I've watched [i.e. Dirty Dancing to name one of them]).  The other day I was listening to my music and heard a song that I used to love, but haven't heard for years.  It is music that makes you want to dance or just move to the music."
Pandora,Great way to listen to whatever you want,Allisa J. Wendland,2-Jan-14,4,Pandora is a fabulous way to listen to whatever type of music suits your mood for the moment.

Pandora,Pretty good,Amazon Customer,14-Jan-14,3,Pandora app is much like the website and it does sync to your account. My only dislike is the new alarm clock function does not work on the kindle Hd. It will not start playing until you open your kindle so it will never actually wake you up.
Pandora,Great for massage therapists,KelsieRB,23-May-16,4,No commercials. Provides relaxing music for my massage business.

Pandora,Pandora Lives On...,~L~ Par-Mer,23-Feb-15,4,"Pandora searches not only for that particular artist/ music you seek, finding this and similar.  Often the reward is music new to you and or some you've forgotten."
Pandora,Amazing!,Kayzy.18,11-Feb-15,5,I love it! The only way it could be better is if it didn't need wick! I listen to music almost 24/7 so that would help. But other than that AWESOME!!!!!! â˜…â™ªâ™¥
Pandora,Hard to beat,Ginnyspal,28-Dec-13,5,"It's hard to beat getting to choose your own style of music with the ability to ""dislike"" a song to never have it play again.  I have several ""stations"" set up to match the mood I am in whenever I want music on in the background."
Pandora,would be five stars but...,Charlie,10-Mar-16,3,It keeps stopping the music but it isn't pauised and it says it is still playing

Pandora,GREAT MUSIC,Pat ORourke,16-May-13,5,"I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO PANDORA BEFORE, BUT HAD NOT HAD MY OWN DEVICE.  I LIKE THE  WAY I HAVE CONTROL OVER THE MUSIC CHOICES.

Both have an option to turn off explicit content and limited commercial interruptions in both. Great joy to listen to
Pandora,not the best,someone,25-Dec-13,1,This thing didn't even come up for me. You probably shouldn't get this. I even let it load for a while.
Pandora,Pandora,Rosemary E. Green,30-Apr-14,5,"Better than a radio, because I can have a say in what plays. If I don't like what's playing just give it the thumbs down and it stops right away. I have rediscovered many old favorites as well as found some new favorites."

Pandora,Music could not be any better!,Girlie,9-Jan-14,3,I highly recommend this for u music lovers out there who just like free music. The only set back is that u can only skip so many songs a day and that u have to pay to get it ad free. Those are the only to reasons that I rated it with 3 stars.
Pandora,Five Stars,Frances Clark,24-Aug-16,5,I love that you can play anything you want
Pandora,Pandora,Mike,28-Aug-16,5,Great way to listen to my favorite music.
Pandora,"stream away, but on your Wifi!",Cat Scratch Fever,10-Jan-17,4,I  Love Pandora. I love listening to it when I am cooking in the kitchen. I like having it on to turn on random songs why I am running or walking. The only thing I don't like about it is it's streaming and using up your data on your phone. And it uses a lot of data.  But the stations you can make up and you can add other artist to the stations you can make up is pretty awesome. I have the Neighbourhood radio station. Do you that I added Calvin Harris. So I can have dramatic songs and happy dance songs all at once. It's kind of like having the best of both worlds.

Thank you, Pandora for getting me through my workday one week a month. I only wish we could spend more time together. For free."
Pandora,Superior digital music feed,Dave Parker,12-Jan-14,5,"I have the free subscription,and I love it. I have enjoyed Sirius FM in my Ford Escape,but cancelled it because of cost.  I am 80 years old, retired 21 years,and watching my expenses.Sirius offered a half-price deal for six months, which I accepted. When that expired, I cancelled again.When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted.  Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

Pandora,Great free radio service.,N. Day,30-Jan-13,4,"No complaints on the app itself. I wish they would have a feature to ""scrobble"" (like last.fm) tracks from iTunes to get better tuned stations. However, I find the stations based on artists generally bring me new music that appeals to me for similar reasons as the original listed artist does."

Pandora,Pandora,Allycat149,3-Jul-13,4,"I love Pandora! It is the best radio for my kindle.  The only thing I would change about it (and I hope they do), is that if u have the free version you only have 40 hours per month of listening time. So when I get up to 40 hours, I start listening to my iheart radio."
Pandora,It is free,Derek DiMeglio,19-Jan-14,5,How could you hate something that gives you what you want for free. The only thing I would change is there is no ban artist button. which I would love. If I get an artist I hate I just push the thumbs down button really fast! hahaha

Pandora,Pandora,Harry Hamburger,7-Nov-12,3,"Pandora is a good value for money with one major problem.  After you listen for a while it pauses, and then asks do you want to continue.  This is a real pain, as I am capable to telling the stupid site when I am done listening, and do not need them to baby sit me.  This is why I consider it only average."
Pandora,Pandora One upgrade? More like Pandora NONE!,Amazon Customer,25-Apr-14,1,"Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. (never received an error message before upgrading)it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer.  I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all.Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

Pandora,"Good, but limited to the west",Kindle Customer,4-Feb-16,4,"Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
Pandora,"Pandora is ""Tops""!!",Richard McPherson,26-Feb-15,5,"Easy to get to and great selection of all types of music.  Now that I'm retiring I can take my tablet and listen to my ""faves"" anywhere, anytime."

Pandora,Problems with compatibility,Amazon Customer,12-Mar-16,1,"Just downloaded this, having several problems. Freezes up, has crashed"
Pandora,"Good, could be great",vinnyf,11-Mar-17,4,"Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"

(One thing I do wish is that you could listen to a song again, or somehow store it on your device - but I understand why this can't be done.) It is easy to use and plays what I like a majority of the time. I will say: UPGRADE TO PANDORA ONE. Commercial free, it is SO worth it. I will gladly pay the $36 a year to not listen to annoying commercials and see continuous pop ups. This is by far one of my favorite apps."

Pandora,Awesome,KittyCatGirl,21-Feb-15,5,Pandora is so fun to use but it sucks that it needs WiFi to actually listen to it. The people who made Pandora need 2 fix that little itsy bitsy problem.
Pandora,If you hate ads then buy the ad-free version.,George V. Sintz,26-Dec-14,3,Spend the extra 3 dollars so you don't have to keep getting the annoying advertisement pop-ups. That is the only reason that I have for the less than great rating.
Pandora,AWESOMENESS,Grace,3-May-14,5,"This is wonderful and plays a lot of good music.You can comment on songs,like them,share them,follow people,comment on people's profile.But you have to be 14 or older to log in.Still I love it"
Pandora,Top of the heap!,trader,4-Dec-13,5,A new paradigm in music enjoyment!  It already has a substantial library of music to satisfy my listening pleasure. Now i probably get 95% of my music through Pandora.
Pandora,My musical brain,Ashlyn1111,9-Aug-16,5,A few thumbs up and your on your way
Pandora,Love Pandora.,Laughingtigress,22-Mar-14,4,The app is easy to use and has a good layout.  The only thing I didn't like was how close together the rating and skip buttons are to each other.  It was too easy to tap the wrong button.  Everything else worked great.
Pandora,I've rreally enjoyed Pandora this weekend,shedrick young,2-Mar-15,5,I've rreally enjoyed Pandora this weekend. All the songs were great. I didn't need a Dj for my party. I just selected my music and it played all night.
Pandora,Music love,Lauren King,7-Mar-13,4,"i personaly have pro and cons of this app but I overall I like it and use it frequency.I like many things: ""liking"" a song, sharing via social network and creating custom stations.Con: repeative, sometimes slow, adds and the hated skip button.Overall I enjoy pandora!"
Pandora,good,imedina151,10-Jun-15,5,this app is exilent. I use it all the time and it is so easy to control. And I really love the fact that it has a timer and alarm.
Pandora,Awesome!,Robert A. Licause,31-Mar-16,5,"Awesome music, excellent to listen to anytime, again just awesome"

Pandora,pandora music app.,julien p.,14-Jun-16,5,A good music app. Lot& lots of music. To choose. From
Pandora,glitches,that person,9-Nov-13,3,The update is cool and all but lately its been glitching. Every thing is easy access and all but when listening to a song and to hear glitches every five or so seconds is annoying.

Pandora,Pandora Needs Better Customer Service/Customer Support...Music Selections Are Fantastic,KayteCanDo,26-Mar-16,5,"I love the stations and feeds on Pandora but if your bank changes your debit or credit card number...you are in for many phone calls to Amazon and emails to Pandora...you can not contact Pandora directly by phone. Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it's not broke don't fix it. Sometimes I can't connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing."
Pandora,Love the music while I am scrolling through my emails,Anon,4-Jun-15,5,"Love the music while I am scrolling through my emails! Anything I feel like hearing, I just create my own radio station. Wonderful!"
Pandora,Nice and convenient,Jennifer Michael,6-Jan-13,5,I use Pandora everywhere I go! They seemed to have cut down on the commercials lately. If I weren't a full time student I would totally pay the price for their membership. They have a great selection of streaming music. Just remember you have to be connected to the internet or Wi-Fi to use it.
Pandora,Great way to discover new songs and artists,Linda in Del,4-Mar-14,4,"Through Pandora, I've discovered new artists and been reminded of old classics I wouldn't hear anywhere else. Sure, I wish the free version didn't have ads, but I understand they have to make a living like the rest of us."
Pandora,Five Stars,Davina Cortez,3-Dec-16,5,Fantastic

Pandora,Love this app.,Amazon Customer,5-Dec-12,4,"i would love it better if i could replay a song. The app itself runs great and I enjoy how the lyrics are provided for most songs. I have two friends who have paid for the app and they say its buggy and doesn't do what it claims to do so I""m hesitate to pay for it. A trial period would be nice."
Pandora,It is easy to use,Anita,2-Jan-15,5,"Pandora is my ""go to"" choice when wanting music.  It is easy to use, the choices are very good and I can't imagine not having it available when I travel."

Pandora,Can't live without it.,Sonya Hamby,14-May-14,5,I often try to remember what life was like without Pandora. Then i remember i just surfed radio stations constantly to find a song I want to listen to. Pandora is much more convenient and never has static :)

Pandora,Five Stars,Fred Damon III,23-Dec-16,5,good
Pandora,LOVE!,31Mom,31-Dec-13,5,"Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"
Pandora,Five Stars,mark cook,2-Oct-15,5,compatability
Pandora,Countless hours of enjoyment!!!,Texas Ted,16-Jul-13,5,"Pandora finally allows my music tastes to be satisfied in a way no radio station ever could!!!!!

Pandora,Thank you,Renee',10-Aug-16,5,I'm glad I have this! No problems.
Pandora,Performs as expected,Bruno C Valdes Lopez,12-Apr-13,5,"As music stream services go, this is a good one.  I only use the ad-supported version, and I have seen the ads to be very wela placed, and don't interrupt the music so much.  The app has helped me find artists I have never heard about, and their music has been a joy to listen."
Pandora,Is this for real?!,"TnForest Park, GA",7-Apr-14,5,"Okay, so I'm late in this whole online streaming thing in my 40's, But I was highly impressed with Pandora. Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy.  I was hooked instantly.  When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."
Pandora,get rid of the commercials,Dr. Gayl,29-Mar-14,1,The commercials suck...I want to hear music...also directions for creating a station from songs is very unclear...I'm going back to iHeart
Pandora,Five Stars,Scott Freitag,26-Jun-16,5,LOVE IT. Listen whenever I am on my computer
Pandora,Music,Mary Ellen Mohla,31-Dec-13,5,It's great being being able to specifically listen to exactly what I chose with little to know interruption ! It's like never having to flip a record or turn over perpetually to hear all the same artist 's music!! It 's priceless!!
Pandora,stops often to check  R U listening  YES.  i WANT overnight radio.,chrissy,5-Jan-14,3,"I like to listen to all night radio.  This keeps asking me, R U still listening.

Pandora,GREAT APP,CLAUD H BENSON JR.,7-Aug-14,5,This is a wonderful app if you are a music lover such as myself. All you have to do is pick an artist or genre of music you like and it will play music for you that you will like for hours.
Pandora,Best App I Have,Mike Brosnan,8-Oct-13,5,"Since starting to use Pandora, my listening has broadened so much.  Rusted Root, Hayley Westernra, Fun....not on my radar before Pandora.  Reminds me of the Napster days...people can share their musical interests and help other listeners.  Great."

Pandora,The oldest streaming audio player I've loved,Elby & Matt,25-Aug-13,5,"Their database to ""map the music genome"" is impressive, they've been working on it for at least 6 years and although sometimes I get frustrated with a couple songs that end up in the mix, they really do share a lot of qualities that I wouldn't otherwise bunch as similar to a specific artist.One of my favorite things to do with Pandora is very similar to spending time on wikipedia... You find one artist you like and make that a new station... soon you are 7 stations away but enjoying every step of the way!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Dawn R. Landron,26-Aug-16,5,Get to listen to radio all day
Pandora,NOPE NOPE NOPE,mike borror,19-Jun-15,1,Horrible app. Cant search for just any song. Seems to always play crappy music. I un installed about an hour after installing.

Pandora,Pandora At Top Of Its Game,W. Vacca,3-Sep-13,5,"Pandora is a great free internet streaming radio service.

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,16-Jun-16,5,It's fantastic! Thank you whoever invented it!
Pandora,Raelly impressed!,Anna May,3-Mar-13,5,I have never used pandora before and downloaded the app because someone recommended it to me.  Was suprised how I typed in an artist of genre and I got exactly what I wanted. I got current music that is hard to find on other websites and is not even heard on my local radio stations.
Pandora,excellent!!!!!!!!!,Tim,16-Nov-16,4,works great
Pandora,Four Stars,B,12-Nov-16,4,love the app
Pandora,Four Stars,Pat Maliska,16-Sep-16,4,Still learning to use it.
Pandora,Pandora FAN!,DatDCFrancochick,3-Nov-13,5,Oh how much do I love Pandora? I listen at work and I listen at home. If I had an unlimited data plan I would likely listen to it more but I use it on my wireless without a problem. I can mix my stations and add songs. I am a fan of Pandora!
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,20-Sep-16,5,Great no problems so far
Pandora,adds,Old Cane Lane,31-Jul-15,2,Adds get in the way I mean it's nice and all but the adds give you a reason to just download music I mean it gets old
Pandora,Music you grew up with.,Singleshot,28-Dec-13,5,"I have a mp3 player that you cannot hear while cutting grass. I bought the Samsung mini S III, installed the Pandora app from Amazon and now I can listen to music of my choicePandora music is liken to comfort food, its great."
Pandora,Five Stars,wood chippie,25-Nov-16,5,Great app
Pandora,Four Stars,Heather,30-Jul-16,4,Love this app.  Use it all the time.
Pandora,Great...but not Genius...,Hipstr62,13-Jun-15,4,Love this radio's quality sound. Just wish it had a more involved way to input choice in artists...such as in Mad Genius radio.
Pandora,it's cool,deealcatcher,26-Apr-13,4,"It's really cool cause the music is free but one problem is you can only listen to Pandora for 40 hours per. Month, and you can only skip 6 songs per hour but other than that Pandora is awsome and very convenient."
Pandora,super app,Paul S. Frank,29-Mar-16,5,"awesome selection of music.....whenever, where ever you are...."

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,6-Dec-16,5,awsome
Pandora,Not Great!,Andrea K. Smith,29-Jan-16,2,"Not the greatest.  Sometimes it plays songs that have nothing to do with any of the songs/artists that I have ""thumbed up"".  In fact, it does that a lot.  The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle."
Pandora,Loveblove love,Tina Ragnone,5-Jun-16,5,Love the music stations and the choices you get!
Pandora,Five Stars,kowabnga69,18-Jun-15,5,Greatselection and music.
Pandora,Suprisingly Amazing,Carla,14-Apr-14,4,"Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you're looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."
Pandora,Love,Genesis,14-Jul-14,5,Its free music who wouldn't love it! One request though is there any way you can make it to where you have an option of listening to just the person you want instead of having many other bands.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,6-Mar-16,5,Love this app for my music selections. Better than others out there!
Pandora,Create your own virtual radio station,Bryan Cass,16-Feb-16,5,"Pandora is a great app if you like to play music based on your mood or your environment.  You can create multiple 'stations' that play what you want to hear by selecting a few artists or songs that you like, then the app will choose other songs that fit that style.  They have spent a tremendous amount of time categorizing and analyzing every song that plays, noting the rhythm, chord structure, key, tempo, harmonics, instrumentation, etc.  By analyzing the songs you pick, it can then go to its library and find songs that match similar features.I don't believe it will play every song on a given album/CD though.  There must be certain tracks that the record label allows them to play.  To hear the rest, you have to buy the album of course.  ;-)"

Pandora,Music radio,Namaste*,15-Jan-13,5,"Pandora is a product that allows you to control what is played. It is good to have this after work to unwind. One word of caution, if you listen on the computer or your Kindle using a Hotspot, Pandora will use a lot of data. Don't be surprised if you have a larger bill than usual."

Pandora,Music with a bang.,Carmen &amp; Milan,19-Dec-12,4,"I chose this radio because of its great diversity in music choice. Ive only used it a few times, but the artists available are aplenty.I do question wether or not one has to rate each song like other online  radios, for the music to continue its playing. That gets a bit tedious."

Pandora,The best way to find new music you will like.,Jim E. Murphy,9-Jul-13,5,"Pandora is my all time favorite source of music.

I am not exactly gadget literate so I was pleased that Pandora is easy to use and the sound is very good as well.  I've already read one book on my Kindle and enjoyed that as well.
Pandora,Love Pandora,Dorothy,21-Apr-14,5,"I use my Pandora App all the time. I can change the stations, shuffle them around for a different mix. It is very easy to use and I can set the tone for what I am doing with the music that is playing."

Pandora,Review for Pandora.,Parker Yancey,30-Dec-12,5,"free music= awesome. you can make your own music station based on artist, genre, or even individual songs. You have a limited number of skips, though so use them wisely. I recommend making many stations of the same kind of music and switching between them to minimize on skip usage."
Pandora,free music app,jrosshbg,6-Sep-13,4,"I don't mind the commercials but wish it would stop asking if you want to download the free version Pandora One.  I like the service otherwise, particularly because it includes lyrics for many songs and it learns what type of music you like."
Pandora,newest update fails,Jiralacat,10-Dec-13,2,"This was a pretty good app before this most recent update. Now, it won't load past the opening screen on my Kindle Fire. Tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the program, but no luck. Fix and I'll change my review."

Pandora,Having trouble navigating and also expensive,ALICE H. WILSON,14-Jun-13,3,"I am new to my kindlefire.  I am just realizing that some items I can get on it cost money while they are running, as opposed to the books when once purchased do not require internet use.

Pandora,It's ok,R.C.,15-Jul-13,3,"Although this station has a wide variety of music to choose from and best of all, it's free, I only gave it 3 stars beccause it freezes/pauses quite a lot and sadly, you only get so many songs per month unless you upgrade,which imcludes a monthly fee."
Pandora,Satisfied,Gloria Bennett,23-Apr-15,5,"I love listening to Pandora!  It plays the kind of music I want to hear, when I want to hear it with no commercial interruptions!"

Pandora,love it,Forte,25-Jan-14,4,"I've never had a problem with Pandora. I use it at work, home, in the car, between multi devices. Would be five stars if they'd add the alarm clock to the kindle version. I charge this more reliably than my phone..."

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,15-Apr-16,5,Good quality app. Doesn't buffer throughout songs.
Pandora,Good for test driving music,Sheila R Goodson,5-Mar-13,3,Primarily designed to try before you buy.Limited options for listeningFound this while trying to figure out how to use the kindle to meet my kids MP3 player needs.  They weren't too impressed because of the limited number of times they could shuffle in a day.
Pandora,Best Stress Reducer Ever,Anne E. Blanton,7-Feb-13,5,"I love Pandora Radio!! I can play music to suit my mood or even change my mood.  If I need a lift or need to calm down, I can change the music to suit me.  I've discovered new music that I love and rediscovered music of my youth.  I can't say enough good things about Pandora"

Pandora,Fun. Easy to use,Julie Healon,24-May-16,5,"Neat app. Fun. Easy to use, and download."
Pandora,See Songs in Other Apps and Stations in Shuffle,Jessica,18-Nov-15,4,"I love Pandora, and I probably listen to it at least 6 hours a day. However, there are 2 problems with the app that I have.First of all, the app used to display the song and artist as well as a pause button in the drop down tool bar on the Kindle Fire. It would be nice to have that back. This way I don't need to be in Pandora to see what song or artist it is.Second, when the stations are on shuffle, it doesn't say which station the song currently playing is coming from. This is a problem because I can't like or dislike songs for fear of them being on the wrong station.Other than thos  two complaints,the Pandora app is awesome!"
Pandora,Fire on my Fire,Robert,29-Jul-16,5,Great addition to my FIRE!
Pandora,Pretty good music box,Amazon Customer,6-Sep-14,4,"Pretty good music box, as i call it. Can't really understand how to chose music that I like.  Very interesting because I really like music.  And I like all styles of music."

Pandora,Love it!,Cynthia,21-Jul-13,5,This is awesome! It was recommended by a friend. He always has me listen to new artists and I asked how he found that he liked them and he said Pandora. Apparently it will play artists comparable to the artists you choose to listen to. Great radio!
Pandora,Love this app at work,Terri,15-Oct-13,5,"It takes a while to load, but it uses less battery power then if I play the music that is loaded onto the device.Has a good shuffle, but can get stuck on a genre for a while, but its music that I like so I'm not bothered by it."

Pandora,would like fewer other performers in the station,CathyT,8-Jan-13,4,"Example: I just created a Les Miserable station. Now I'm having to listen to unrelated music because it morphed into including non Les Miz music. I understand the need to incorporate other titles, but those other titles then bring in other unrelated music to the original topic."

Pandora,The Best,Niko,9-May-17,5,"The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The Best The BestSeriously, though this is an awesome application that helps me through my workouts and my rough days. The variety of music never lets a day get stale and I even sneak these on during my 12 hour work days. The premium version disables ads and at least on the home version gives you higher quality audio. Audio quality is not noticeable on earbuds or low quality headphones, don't worry about that too much."

You can pick your artists that you like and then it will recommend music from what you've liked.  You can make your own ""radio stations"" and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs.  It also puts them into categories, which I like (country, alternative, etc.)  For example, in his country, he has the ""Lee Brice"" station, his rap the ""Eminem"" station, etc.  And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc."

Pandora,love it,Madiaon Richard,21-Dec-15,5,It is so good it's just that I have to lesion to other music besides the one I want
Pandora,"A great app, hindered only by ridiculous amounts of advertising",Gabe,13-Dec-12,5,"I love Pandora on my laptop, and now I love it on my Fire HD, too! It works great, but be warned that there are way more (visual) ads on the tablet than on the PC version. At least, that's the way that it seems, but perhaps this has something to do with the much smaller screen. I can certainly forgive these ads, however, since the radio stations that Pandora creates for me are so fun to listen to, and they need to make their money some way. If I grow tired of the ads, I can always upgrade my Pandora account, so as to eliminate them for a fee. However, I don't spend that much time even looking at the tablet when this app is in use- and as a nice bonus, the display darkens after the app has been running for some time, so as to conserve battery power (the speakers will still play the music, of course, and the app continues to run)."
Pandora,One Star,Tara,25-Jul-16,1,Don't like wouldn't work
Pandora,Pandora is great....,Robert J. Aquaro,3-Feb-14,5,"I like the variety, the fact that you can ""like"" or ""dislike"" a particular song, and the overall performance. The occasional interuptions for a message are not that frequent and I like that too."

Pandora,Five Stars,Julia Garay-Daniel,11-May-16,5,The music is great. Excellent selections.
Pandora,Great app for a music afficionado.,Xanadu,29-Sep-16,5,"Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that."
Pandora,horrible,ixela,16-Jun-15,2,It is bad because i have been trying to sign up and it gets out of pandora and goes to the front page of my phone

Two stars.UPDATE 10/20/14: Ads have become progressively more obnoxious and intrusive. Today I had one lock up the entire Kindle - I couldn't even power it down. One star - unacceptable.

Pandora,Okay,Alexis Irvin,7-Oct-13,3,This App only works half of the time. Sometimes I have to shut down my kindle just for it to work. I don't like that you only have a specific number of times that you can skip songs. That's why I rated it with three stars.
Pandora,"Love Pandora for any genre, any day, anytime.",Lucia M. Cunningham,7-Mar-14,5,"Love Pandora for any genre, any day, anytime.No Matter what my mood from spiritual to my country rootsor just a stroll down memory lane, I can find it and hear itall on Pandora."

Pandora,Eh...,Kurt M,24-May-14,3,Well you can hear the music fine but what I don't like is that I can't search a song for it to play. It also needs to have a loop button so you can listen to a song more than once.
Pandora,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,22-Aug-16,3,thank you
Pandora,It's Pandora...,Kindle Customer,3-Jan-14,5,"I've been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
Pandora,Five Stars,Ryan Woythaler,4-Mar-16,5,Works perfect.  No issues.  Highly recommended.
Pandora,wonderful streaming,Amazon Customer,11-Feb-13,5,"Always user friendly. Wonderful music I couldn't choose it so well for myself if I tried.

Pandora,First and (still) the Best,G. Biggs,27-Feb-16,5,"I love Pandora and I'm fiercely loyal to the service. Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe (didn't know about they offered a subscription service). The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent (some don't even have bios yet) or established artists you've never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - don't know, don't care. It's Pandora for me."

Pandora,I enjoyed it from start to finish,Jo Elin DuBois,25-Nov-14,5,"If this is a referral for Pandora by Anne Rice, then I definitely give it 5 stars.  Pandora describes the life of a Roman woman of the upper class 2000 years ago.  It is thorough in her descriptions both of women and and the soldiers of Caesar's armies. I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Pandora is one of Anne's vampire books but like all her vampire books, the characters are much more than just vampires and she develops them so that the reader sees them as human as well as vampire with the human still dominating their lives as they struggle with their new identities."
Pandora,Its the greatest!,Carol B.,13-Jun-14,5,"I love Pandora.  It lets me select from many favorites, I especially like the songs from the 60's  70's.  The best part is that I can play it on my smart phone with ear plugs."

Pandora,Variety is Great,Diane,23-Feb-16,5,"I have been using Pandora for years now.  I listen to it at work and home.  One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity.  It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting.  I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office.  But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down.  Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."

Pandora,Pandora is the best!,Paula Strom,17-Jul-16,5,I Love pandora.
Pandora,Great app,Pyroki,6-Oct-13,4,"If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you.  I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app.  However, there are a few problems:40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week.  That's a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you don't listen to as much as I do (I'm almost constantly listening to music)Ads: not too bad, the limit is what gets me.  What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.Sure, they give a couple good solutions.  The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that's just for a month.  Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right.  If you have access to a computer, that's the best option in my opinion.  However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer isn't on and ready."

Pandora,nice to listen to!,Lacy Engel,26-May-13,4,"I love pandora, and personally, the ads don't bother me (I  mean, I'm not going to pay to get rid of them, so it works for me). I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!"

Pandora,Music Rocks,MKRay,22-Apr-13,5,"I love this app.  It is easy to use and lets you choose what ""channel"" you like listening to. It wlll give you a variety of different ""Like"" songs to the type you requsted.  I don't like that you can only skip 6 songs in an hour and it MAKES you listen to those you don't like.  I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the ""no commercials"" aspect, which I have.  Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM""  what the ????I mean really?  They pay?  No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me.  But again the music is good and I do like the app."

Pandora,Great music app!,April Pahl,17-Jul-15,5,"What can I say, who doesn't love Pandora? You can make your favorite channel by picking your favorite song, your favorite artist, your favorite genre or just add the already made channels by Pandora. You can also give each song you hear a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down"" which helps to train the station to play what you like. If a particular song comes on and you don't feel like listening to it, you can move ahead to the next song.It really gives a good mix of music and I really enjoy listening to it.I have found this app to be quite reliable. I never seem to have a problem with it crashing.I have it downloaded to my phone and tablet. In the car, I hook up the phone to the car's speakers before I leave the parking lot and using my 4G, I listen to Pandora as I drive around. It is so much better than listening to local radio that plays whatever it wants instead of what I want.I am very happy with this app!"

Pandora,Cool,ChrisG,15-Jul-13,3,How can you go wrong it's free and you can program it to play only what you like and after a while it understands what your preferences are. Instead of buying the music you can simply create your own station that you want to hear.

Pandora,Five Stars,G.A.,7-Nov-15,5,Let's you listen to music on my fire like any other device.
Pandora,The Pleasure Of Good Music...Pandora,Nora,5-Jul-14,4,"I have listened to Pandora music for over a year now, and I have enjoyed the freedom and variety of music offered through this app. It syncs well with my laptop and I know that it keeps a record of all my favorite ""thumbs up"" songs. I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on.My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it."
Pandora,Five Stars,Kindle Customer,20-Feb-16,5,"It's an App, it is for Pandora. That's what it does."

Pandora,Pandora is a fine way to listen to what you like in music.,Bob,20-Apr-15,4,"I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows  what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"

It is easy to use, and setting up a new station takes a few seconds.  Couldn't be easier."
Pandora,Love it,Pamela,2-Jan-13,5,"I love Pandora.  I only use the free app., and still its awesome!  The commercials are rare, and I don't mind them anyway.  Commercials allow the program to exist - just like television.  This is a GREAT way to get all the music you could ever use!!"

Pandora,Like it,Nell,13-Nov-12,4,Not bad for a radio app. Plays music I haven't heard in years. it's not Spotify but since I can't get it on my tablet Pandora will do. The one thing I dislike is I can only skip 6 time in any given hour so I just change thru my song list to switch songs.
Pandora,"fantastic on kindle, awful on tv",A. Fuller,17-Oct-15,3,"This app is great when I want not-awful music to listen to, when I want to have control over the sort of thing I want to listen to but have no idea what it is exactly what I want.But it is terrible on the newest fire tv. It takes at least five minutes to load a song, something I thought was a fluke when I first installed it on the Fire tv but seems to be literally every time. Still works fine on my kindle and laptop and phone and that's why its still got three wtaes, but goodness it's awful on the Fire tv (which I give a resounding no-star review for). I hope that's fixed soon."

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,10-Mar-16,5,Cant live without Pandora !
Pandora,Great source for free music,Yasmin,15-Sep-13,5,"Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better!In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"
Pandora,love it!!,diane oliver,23-Nov-14,5,enjoy the music. easy to start stations. the price is free. ads are very few and not distracting. well worth getting the app.

In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain.

Pandora,Pandora,bobone,25-Feb-14,5,I enjoy listening to music and Pandora allows me to create stations according to my musical taste. I also listen to Pandora on my cell phone and Sonos. I recommend Pandora.
Pandora,Typical of most Amazon Apps,Anahita,18-Jul-13,2,"I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music.  I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it.  The Kindle, that is.  However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right.  Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers:  the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid.  Pandora is advertised as free:  download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE.  Not so, of course:  if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements.  If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever.  Ads pop up all over the place.  You can't see the album covers for ads.  Oh, but wait:  just pay the price, and the ads will go away!  The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad.  What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay.  I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle.  The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words.  The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time.  As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."
Pandora,GREAT.,Gladys Menefee,14-Feb-14,5,"This is a great program. My husband is learning  how to work it,  and many things on it and how to work it. He says it is the best thing I ever gave him.(JUST KIDDING)......."

Pandora,amazing,Amazon Customer,1-Apr-12,5,This app is just as I titled it a very well structured app. I also like how you can create your own stations and then be able to erase it if needed. The best part of this app though is that it plays all the music you like and so far as I noticed it doesn't freeze or go blank.

Pandora,Pandora Radio,Matthew Hayden,2-Jan-14,5,"I enjoy Pandora because it offered the experience I wanted in a simple manner. I wanted to listen to the things I like in a radio fashion without having to select each song individually. Pandora offers that, just type in the desired artists and songs and listen to just them or click shuffle and get a bit of the whole group plus some recommended related groups. The component of liking or disliking the song that is playing is another fantastic feature that ensure only the enjoyable stuff gets repeated."

Pandora,For all music lovers.,Lee Callaci,25-Jun-14,5,I think Pandora is a great service. There isn't anything I dislike about it and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys good music.
Pandora,Pandora is not a free service!,Jim Gordon,7-Jul-13,5,"The app itself works farily well and has most features you would want. Pandora is never free! You either pay $36/yr for Pandora One with no commercials on the screen or audio, or you pay with your loss of time, self dignity and sanity by allowing Pandora to force feed you audio and video ads between songs. Far from free. Yes, I know millions of Americans have been conditioned to tolerate intrusive advertising in their daily life but there is a cost to you. It has conditioned you to make compromises in your quality of life for no legitimate reason, just the corporate greed trying to leach upon your every moment of the day. Don't let them do it. The 'free' Pandora is a preview service only for your introduction to the concept. Pay the $36/yr for Pandora One, sending a clear message you value your time and dignity too much to be force fed advertisments. Reviews here keep saying there is no way to turn it off but on my Kindle Fire HD there are at least 3 ways I came across with only a minute's effort. You can hit the pause button during a song to stop it. You can explore the icons on the screen and find several ways to log off. Of course this means you must re-enter your email and password later so I just hit the pause button. If you don't like the occasional prompts that ask if you are still there, send the following message to Pandora Customer Support: ""I don't care what you pay in royalties, just charge us what you must to provide completely uninterrupted service like other services and satellite radio offers.""  Take charge of your technology, don't let your technology take charge of you!"

Pandora,"Customize your own ""Radio Stations""",Kittykisses,25-Jul-13,5,"This app is a nifty program! I was looking for an all-in-one app (something like iTunes-but they dont make iTunes for my device), and this one came closest to the mark.You can listen three ways:--Upload all your own music--Purchase music from Pandora--Listen to unlimited, free music in the form of ""radio stations""The feature I like the most is the Radio Station ""maker"". You can make custom lists of songs that Pandora will play in sequence, and it does NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy.For example, if you like a specific genre of music, you can choose that search feature, Pandora will go out and grab music that falls into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it brings in a song you dislike-you click on  ""skip"" button and it will be discarded from your station.You can also rate songs so the app will learn what interests you.You can make other radio stations (and keep the many different stations you make in a library) by using your own music or by combining yours with Pandora's.You can make radio stations of a single band, specific genre's, or many other different ways.It's a great app to find music you are thinking about purchasing and listen to all of it first, or to find music you haven't heard yet from a band you love, and even find other bands you've never heard before based on music you like.The app comes in a free, ad-based version (the ad's are NOT annoying and relentless), or you can get a paid app. The one I use is the free one, and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercials.Great music listening software!"

I stream it on my phone at work, in the car or on my bike and pretty much anywhere I go.So far, so good. I like the way Pandora chooses music for me based on my selections. I've learned of lots of performers I didn't know before that are a lot like my favorites. Most of the time it chooses well, but if it doesn't I can unlike that track and the program learns better what I do like. It's a great alternative to regular radio stations because I don't like commercials or annoying DJ's.After signing up for a month of Pandora, I've decided to opt for a whole year so I won't be without it."

Pandora,Five Stars,J Buczacki,9-Sep-15,5,Excellent source of music to hear where ever you are.
Pandora,"Pandora ""Box"" is great",Kindle Customer,29-Dec-12,5,"I have Pandora installed on my older model computer and had trouble with smooth streaming.  With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear.  I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"".  After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre.  If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station.""  If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc.  Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora."
Pandora,Quality app performance,Sara,24-Feb-16,5,Always worth it.

I like music to be playing when I'm working,and Pandora is not the easiest to get going quick, but they also play songs by the artists I select that I don't even have in my extensive collection. I like the fact that you can select artists and they create a whole station around them and artists that are similar. Their picks for extra artists are generally very good--many artists I like are already included with others I've chosen. The few short commercials are hardly a bother, and they play long cuts uninterrupted."

Pandora,Love it,Alan,23-Jan-16,5,A great selection of music.
Pandora,"Use Spotify, it's better anyway",Christopher,24-Mar-16,3,"The issues I have are with the app itself for a Kindle Fire, not necessarily for Pandora as a whole.  There are certain ads you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch/listen to.  If you don't Pandora just stops, doesn't play any more music, but stays open.  There isn't any way to skip or pause the music unless you, once again, physically open the app.  You can only see what song is playing and the band who performs it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu.  There are some minor issues with songs randomly pausing half way through and then skipping unannounced and without prompting to the next song.  The ads on this version of the app are longer and more frequent than on my Android phone, iPod or laptop versions."
Pandora,Five Stars,Michael J. Wallace,24-Feb-16,5,Excellent

There's just one HUGE problem; the music won't play. That's right, even though that everything else works, the music, the #1 reason why this was made and why people bother using this is that only one thing that doesn't work. It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track won't play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait. There's one more thing that doesn't work; it's the search engine for music stations, which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review, I really don't recommend this..."

Pandora,Love the New Music,Philip S. Keat,20-Sep-13,5,Pandora introduces me to new music that I might never have heard on local radio.  Keeps my musical listening current and fresh.  I listen to hit while hiking and working out.
Pandora,"Good, but I don't use it much",p pouncey,29-Dec-13,3,"This app sounds great, but I don't really use it much since I have the Sirius/XM app installed.  I would use it more if I didn't have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about:  1) Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2) when I select an artist to start with, it seems they don't play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited.  For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I'll hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes.  In the meantime, I'll hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others.  So maybe this app is not for me."

Pandora,Pandora App,Autumnrayne,25-Mar-14,4,I really love Pandora! It's basic but sometimes that's all you really need. Love the playlist & artists you love all at your fingertips.
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Shane,6-Aug-15,5,"I think Pandora is the best option for listening to music, other than maybe the actual radio. The commercial breaks aren't that long, and they aren't ridiculously frequent. You can control exactly what kind of music you listen to, and there's no limit on how many channels you can have. There's the skip button for when you hear a track way too often, although there is a limit on how many times you can use that. Of course, there's always the alternative (and unlimited) way to skip a song: just change stations. All in all, I can't think of anything bad about Pandora, other than the fact that if you don't have internet you can't use it. But, most devices have mobile data and/or a personal hotspot, so if you REALLY feel the need to listen, you can. I love Pandora!"

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,29-Nov-15,5,Works well!
Pandora,A great app,Poorkitten,19-May-14,4,"This is a great app if you want to discover new bands. It has a radio system for bands and genres. Each station has about five bands that are similar to the main band on that station. It mixes songs from those bands in with the band you know, so you hear songs that you might like. This app helped me discover 5 new bands that I really like. The major problem I seem to have is that even if a band has 6 albums, I constantly plays the same 10-15 songs. This really annoys me because if I look on youtube for songs from said band, I see all these songs I never knew existed and I very well might like better than what i hear on pandora. I know pandora has them in their library because if I look at the album information, I can get 30 second samples of songs. It doesn't seem that hard to just randomly pick any of the 50 songs that a band might have."

Pandora,(Update) Looking for Exit...,Dxer,15-Nov-12,4,"Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD?  The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might ""Misbehave""  haha..  It's already misbehaving!!  While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can ""quit"" instead of forceclosing, thank you.A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.If the ads bother you, it's easy to fix, just get the paid app.After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you aren't it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."

Pandora,not defective after all,C. Quinn,14-Dec-13,4,"I downloaded this app and was pleased to see that it has a sleep timer and other features not offered on my nook app.  However, as one reviewer mentioned, it seemed to just lock up when I tried to open it for the second time.  What I did was to remove it from my device and reload it everytime I wanted to use it.  That was a bit of a hassle, I thought, but yesterday I realized in frustration when it came up with the pandora screen and I just tapped that screen, it opened.  Boy, did I feel silly! In my defense, I am over 50 and what is supposed to be ""intuitive"" to many isn't ""intuitive"" to me.  Anyway, I'm thrilled that I figured that out and am now able to listen to all my channels on the great speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would have rated it with 5 stars except that there are more adds on this free version than on my free nook app."

Pandora,"Pro-rape tracks allowed as ""comedy"". Free speech needs better limitation.",StilettoFiend,28-Sep-16,2,"The service is an amazing idea, and I used to enjoy it. However, they let so many violent and pro-rape tracks slip through the cracks. I wrote to them, and, of course, the representative had to defend free speech and their policy on their ""comedy"" selection. Freedom of speech is an essential component of our culture, but companies and individuals must take responsibility for what's clearly right and wrong."

Pandora,Who Doesn't Love Free Music?,Eric A. Burr,15-Jan-14,5,"I've been using this app for years. These days, many people seem to be turning to Spotify. But Pandora does not hammer you with so much in the way of intrusive advertising. The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I'm very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and don't like (respectively), over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I'm an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."

Pandora,Pandora,Margo Wagner,27-Dec-13,5,Downloaded quickly to my device.  Very easy to use.  Love the customizable abilities of Pandora.  Looking forward to lots of good music.
Pandora,"Pandora Was My Favorite, Edited Songs, Limited Library, Repeat Songs",B. Good,27-May-13,3,"I have used Pandora since around 2006. It seemed at that time (in my experience)Pandora was one of the only services offering free streaming of music based on user input. I have Pandora One and I am disappointed that despite changing my settings to allow explicit content many of the songs are edited. It seems that the same songs are played several times over, even within a few hours. I still use Pandora Radio but I am losing enthusiasm fast. There are now many other similar services that offer a much greater selection of songs. I have tried several of the other services and the music has much more variety on many of the other services._Bottom Line_ I would carefully compare all services before committing to one. There are now so many to choose from and each service has its limitations. Each service also has its perks too. Do some research and find out what fits best. Yes, I still recommend Pandora Radio to friends but I no longer recommend paying for the service. This review is based on my own opinion, individual experience, and style. I do not believe this is a one size fits all."
Pandora,Love Pandora!,ROB,12-May-14,5,Love it. Easy. Fast.  Great taste. My favorite app by far. Introduces new artist's and revisits old. Get it you.

The only reason Pandora gets four stars instead of five is that I'm reserving my five star rating, in the area of music streaming services, for a service that has a genuinely global catalog.

Artists, Songs, Genres are easy to find and use - especially for those of us who are technically-challenged. My little complaint is that I can't always ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" a song...what is equally nice and sometimes frustrating, is this app allows you to listen to music while doing other things on your tablet. Minor quirks aside - I'm very happy with this app and would recommend to anyone!"

This rating is for the application only.

She's able to listen to her Pandora music even while she uses her Kindle to read a book.  I would have been happy if this app had to open with no other app running, providing it worked.  But this app goes beyond and has earned the 5 star rating hands down.  My wife is VERY happy with this app.Works well on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9."

Pandora,Wouldn't want to live without it.,Helen Crow,12-Dec-12,5,"Teaching the folks in my office to use Pandora on their individual computers has saved me from overhead/overall radio music (so not my taste) all day every day at work.  Now, we each hear what we want to hear and nothing else.At home, we stream Pandora through an iPod using BlueTooth into the stereo that plays throughout the house.  That has saved us from getting bored with our own (extensive, but too familiar) music collection.One of the most fun things we have done with Pandora was to pass the iPod around at a party for friends to start new ""Pandora radio stations"" for us by selecting musicians who were new to us.  Found a world of great music that way.LOVE Pandora."

Pandora,Four Stars,lynwal,20-Feb-15,4,"I give 4 stars, the only thing are the ad pop-ups."
Pandora,"Alright, but doesn't beat Spotify.",Jacob,10-Jul-15,4,"This is an awesome application as everyone knows. It works but too many apps. So if you got 5$ a month to pay for add-free music go ahead. The only bad thing about this service is the limit of it's music. It only has only 1 million songs. (It's true; search it up.) Meaning that after a while of listening to a station for so long you start noticing the same songs coming on. Easy product but it's limited.This is why I use Spotify. Spotify has 20 million songs. So pay 5 dollars for music that you can't really look for specifically or pay 10 dollars a month for no adds unlimited listening and search and play exact songs. Now I just sound like a Spotify employee lmao. Anywho, Spotify is better."
Pandora,Five Stars,LLb,31-Aug-15,5,"LOVE, LOVE!"
Pandora,So good I listen for hours,authorncr,15-Dec-13,5,"I'm a late-comer to Pandora. I subscribed about a month ago and have told my friends about it because it's made a big improvement in my life.  That sounds melodramatic but it's true.  I have always been a music lover and studied classical piano seriously when I was young. A few years ago I developed a physical condition that required me to quit working, limit my driving and avoid crowds.  I'm living on a shoestring.  And I live way out in the sticks.  There's no cell reception, cable or public transportation here.  On Pandora I set up six stations to fit my taste in music.  The first day I set up a station combining piano jazz and classical piano.  I listened to it day in and day out until I felt satisfied.  Next I went to blues and folk. Yesterday I listened to my favorite rock + roll for hours and learned about music that is new to me.  That's part of the reason I like Pandora so much -it combines what I know with new choices. Also, the quality of Pandora 's sound is first rate.  I took the upgrade right away - it's an inexpensive way to get rid of ads."

Pandora,They need to fix this.,ThePlasticDolphin,27-Feb-14,4,"I love Pandora... but recently, it's not as great. When I start it up, it takes 3-5 tries to get a song to play. After a few songs it stops playing. It's disappointing to know such a great app can have so many glitches.It's not like I don't like Pandora, because I really do. I like how it's free but of course, free is limited... but to be honest, you can do lots of things users that pay them can. For once. It's great to know that I can listen to certain music instead of a mix.Overall I love it! :)"

Type in the artist name and hear their music plus others like them. I'm a fan of TuneIn and I find Pandora a nice alternative. If you enjoy a variety of music then download this app. The down side-it cuts off after a while if you're not a paid subscriber. Not a deal breaker but me personally, I have a problem paying for radio. Lol...maaybe I'mjust getting old but hey, I remember when the radio use to be free."

I like to be organized, so it be nice if I could organize all of my favorite songs in a ranked order. Thanks."

Pandora,My personal views on Pandora,Dennis j ryan,27-Apr-14,4,"I just recently signed up for Pandora and have not had the time to give you a fair, evaluation of what Pandora has to offer, at not monthly cost to me. Several of my friends have subscribed to other stations that offer what Pandora offers, but at monthly charge rates that can add  up over the course of a years time.I have chosen several programs, on Pandora that meet my listening needs and have added peace and soothing my mind over sometimes stressful  times and also offered me music of many music artists that I grew with when I was younger and are much more soothing than much of what I hear, on the general FM stations today.I look forward to listening more to Pandora in the future. Keep up the good broadcasting services you now are offering.The world today can be a hectic environment and peaceful music is more than appreciated by me and others that also carry many of the portable devices, like a Kindle Hd or I Pads.Thanks for your current music services.Dennis Ryan, Tampa, Fl"

As a older user I enjoy the feature that shows you similar  artists that you have never heard of or only recognize by the music that you hear. I have added many channels that feature artist/groups that I learned about on Pandora. I have Pandora One which for $ 4.99 a month keeps me up with the new music that is out there. This is really great when you around younger people and you name groups that they all like....hmmm keeps me young and is saying ""Cool"" still Cool? I sure hope so, but if not I guess I could say "":Sick""  and know that might be cool??? Dancingron"

I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy,  playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay!  Download today!  Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)"

Pandora,"which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly",Zorro,13-Jun-15,2,"Meh. I'm tired of clicking thumbs down on the music of Kenny Baker and Joe Venuti, which I hate, and having them bring it up repeatedly, I suppose because they have some kind of deal with them. What about the deal with me, a paying customer? Won't renew. Incidentally, these are just examples, not isolated cases. On stations with older music, their variety is quite limited--baroque, for example, or several of their classical stations, probably because they're focused on a young audience."

Pandora,Meh.,killermist,8-Feb-16,3,"Good music player... for things not on the local device.  Everything is streamed.  For some, this is awesome.  For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.Then, there's the randomness.  You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline.  And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.Not horrible.  But plenty of room for improvement."
Pandora,Awesome on Kindle Fire,Jeremy,16-Jan-13,5,I switched to Pandora after Slacker failed me on the Kindle Fire.  Loving it at the moment.  It does have the occasional glitch/spazz out but nothing serious.  I think this is about as good as it gets for free Internet Radio.

It keeps giving me R&B type songs for some reason, and it won't let me skip them or give them a thumbs down after just a few. I also wish there were fewer live versions of songs. It is frustrating when you hear the same song in three versions in an hour. Again these are my only complaints. Other than that I love the program and much prefer it over My Heart Radio."

But for me there are three major glitches to work out.1.) It won't let me log back into Pandora without removing from my device and redownloading it.2.) Half the time it won't let me listen to music, it'll say that it can't find anymore related songs to change the station, but it does that on every station and hasn't gotten any better, it's done that to me very time this week I've tried to listen.3.) When the warning first popped up, it said I had 48 hours of free music left, so I logged out wanting to save it for long car rides, but when I logged back in a couple of days later it said I had no free music left, even though I hadn't listened to it at all.So Pandora, I'm willing to give you two stars for excellence in music, but I won't go any higher than that because of the glitches, I'd appreciate it very much if you would fix them, then maybe I can give you five stars."

Pandora,For BlackBerry OS10,Larry S.,23-Dec-15,1,"Works well enough and like many Android native apps lacks the feature set for BlackBerry.  That said, audio quality is excellent.Not a 4-star product because it nags with emails to the hub!  Would be 5-stars if native for BlackBerry and also not nag to emails.---UPDATE: June 30, 2017- At some point, after an app update, Pandora's audio stream became flaky and unreliable resulting in frequent herky-jerky audio and frequent error messages upon attempt launch ""Pandora not responding"".  Used to be able to use hihj-quality audio stream, but now even with lower quality stream problem is very frequent. Interestingly, all my other live-stream apps function great 99% of the time that I experience problems with Pandora.  So, if it is related to weak cell signal, it certainly is rarely effecting other live-stream audio apps (music and voice).- Pandora used to allow users to increase buffer size to workaround such issues but no longer.- Downgraded to one-starNo guidance from Pandora on this issue and referred to generic Android troubleshooting tips which were useless."

Pandora,A little disappointing. :(,Anya C.,28-Jun-13,3,"I love rock music like Led Zeppelin. I tried to type in Led Zeppelin and my favorite song, Stairway to Heaven, but it shows a lot other music that you don't want to listen to. Â·You can type in The Beatles then Jimmy Hendrix could show up. You only get three skips to skip a song you don't like. Total rip off. You can't listen to the music you typed in; only random music of that genre. Â·Also, it doesn't even let you make a playlist of your favorite music. You will be lucky if you get a few songs by that artist or the one song you typed in. Sometimes even if you don't get the song you want, you can listen to others that you might like. Â· Another flaw is that you can't listen to the same song again after you listen to it once. You cannot replay nor can you rewind or fast forwarded songs.Waste of time for those of you who want to listen to certain music.I give this 5/10."
Pandora,best music app device,Monica J.,11-Aug-13,5,Pandora has a trillion songs on on  station I can listen to it all day  bio wish it had a rewind  just like the fast forward

Pandora,I AM IN LOVE WITH PANDORA!!!,"nightowl - Rome, GA",30-Nov-13,5,"A friend introduced me to Pandora and I immediately fell in love.  I love all types of music so being able to pick a station that will play classic country today and Hip Hop the next is wonderful.  You can even see the song lyrics while the song is being played.  I just wanted the free version and not have to pay so for this feature you do have to listen to ads.  I don't mind because it is worth it.  Pandora is so great that I went online and ordered two portable speakers so I can really hear my music as loud as I like.  I can hear it on my iphone, Kindle, laptop and now on my computer at work.  It's great to have your favorite music playing in the background while you work.  No radio to have to keep up with and find a empty outlet.  Pandora you rock and this is from a 63 year old grandmother who loves her music!"

Pandora,Easy access to fresh music,B. Kopenhaver,20-Dec-12,5,"A pretty solid app, especially if you drop the 36$ for a yearly subscription, it allows continuous play of music based on your input. Like a song or band or genre? Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it won't play it again.It's not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."

Pandora,"Love, Love, Love This App!",LissaLeeAnn,15-Jan-16,5,"First let me start by saying I think this has been improved from a few years ago because I had it on a previous phone and it did not always work properly.  On my latest phone, I have not had any issues whatsoever.  I love the fact that a person can create their own stations and I feel that Pandora does a good job of choosing music based upon my likes and dislikes.  Pandora is used all the time at my house.  I do have the free version, which has occasional ads.  However, the ads are few enough that it does not bother me.  If ads do annoy a person, then an ad free version of the app can be purchased."

Pandora,Great ap for selecting the music you like and deleting the music you don't. Wide variety of music choices.,Mary Maple,29-Oct-15,5,"Wonderful choice of on-line music that allows you to add favorites to your playlist and delete forever songs that you don't like.This is a wonderful choice for those who do not want to listen to secular music with bad language and adult themes but get tired of listening to Christian radio and limited song choices.It's free to use and you can customize, see lyrics and select the music you want to hear. It really does not get much better.We played the Christmas channel while wrapping holiday gifts and it was perfect. They will occasionally plug in a short commercial which is not very intrusive and does not last long or occur too frequently, but for a free service, it is well worth it.It suggests songs for you based on the ones you have already listened to and you can set playlists that allow you to listen to the BGs and the Beatles on the same play list."

This will help us enjoy worshiping the Lord, and having our minds focused on Him. 2. ) I suggest that you have more song selections for an artist, instead of switching to different artists on their radio. For example, if Phil Wickham has more albums out, could his station just play more of those, instead of just one or two? That's my thoughts. Otherwise I would give it a five star rating because of its easy access, availability to access different stations and the  superb bookmarks as well. Thanks for your free service Pandora, I will have to say though that your Christian stations are the best! :)"
Pandora,Greatest music app,David L. Bruce,4-Nov-13,5,"absolutely the best ever,i get to listen to all the music I love and hear stuff I haven't heard in years"
Pandora,Great App,JR,13-Dec-12,4,"This App is great on my Ipad 4.  Not sure what the paid version gets you other than not ads.  But at $3.99 a month, I can handle the ads once in a while."
Pandora,okay,Mia,14-Jul-13,3,I don't like choosing an album and when you click on it you are lucky if you get anything from the artist that you picked.
Pandora,"My music, catered to me",Beth B.,17-Sep-14,5,"Love this app! I have a smart tv, so I get it right on my tv, and it's nice when I want to clean or not be distracted by tv shows. It caters to my musical needs, gives me songs that I like. So no need to change the stations, just know that the type of music I like will be played. I plan on making more stations, so that I can listen to a variety of music. The only thing I don't like is that if I want to change stations, I have to exit Pandora and start over. Would be nice if it gave you the option to change stations in the menu."

Pandora,No Regrets Downloading,Mary,2-Feb-14,5,"I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."
Pandora,Music while you whatever!,R. Stanley,13-Aug-13,4,Good mix of stations that have the genre that you choose. It introduces me to more talented artists and their music.

Pandora,How wonderful life is with Pandora in the world,theperson,26-Jul-14,3,"I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments  which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke$ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too!:)"

Pandora,Pandora is AWESOME!,Jenn R.,15-Jul-15,5,"Okay, I admit it, I am addicted to Pandora now.  Before I got it I didn't understand what the hype was....Why not just listen to the radio?  I love how I can tailor the station to the types of music I like and thumbs down the music and songs I don't like.  There are also very few commercials, unlike with the radio where you can get 5 minutes worth of commercials at a time.  When I get in the car I put on my seat belt, start the car, and set up Pandora through Bluetooth.  It has become part of my driving routine.  I also connect it to a stereo so I can listen while cleaning, doing yard work, or swimming in the pool."
Pandora,pandora radio,Caramel7,14-Jul-13,5,I love the fact that I can customize my own radio stations on Pandora! And that they can change with my mood. Thank you
Pandora,it's okay,Bernard Whitfield,1-Mar-13,3,way too many ads.Bookmarking is useless. when you bookmark a song you then only get a few seconds of the song when you go back to it.

Pandora,How did it know that?,Jacob Huelstrunk,20-Sep-13,4,"It's very easy to get in a musical rut, playing the same album, playlist or group over and over. Pandora combats this. What first seems a shortcoming, limiting the number of songs from a given artist it can play in a time period, is actually it's best feature. Pandora does a good job of selecting other music similar to your original criteria. What's really amazing is, as you give more feedback about what you like and don't like, it does an uncanny job of selecting tunes that appeal to your taste.  I know Pandora advertises this proprietary feature up front but I'm really amazed at how well it works.On the down side, the Windows interface is great, clean and user friendly, but I find the Android version on my phone a challenge. Part of the problem is my big fingers, poor eyesight and penchant for bright sunshine. Still, I think they should take that into account in a mobile app."

I love it on those increasingly rare occasions when I want to listen to music, the variety is great, and I hear songs I had forgotten about.

Pandora,excellent product,KEITH D KIEFFER SR K.D.KIEFFER,10-Jan-13,5,PANDORA HAS AN EXCELLENT SELECTION OF ARTISTS AND GENRES THAT COVERS A WIDE VERITY OF MUSICAL ARTISTS AND A VERITY OF CLASSIFICATIONS OF MUSIC.
Pandora,Try before you buy,Mike C.,4-Feb-16,1,"Personally I do not like Pandora it doesn't have enough songs I like. I listen to EDM and their selection is quite limited. I used to use an online station called shoutcast and it was awesome, completely free and no advertisements. Pandora follows the free to play model where you get a decent taste with the free version but frustrating enough that your basically forced to get the paid version."

Pandora,Frustrating,pearlgirl,22-Feb-16,3,It is a great app. You get to listen to a variety of music and it's free. But it is really frustrating how often it reopens after just pausing it. I often pause because we like the song and something is making it hard to hear and then there is no way to get back to it. It also happens when it disconnects from a blue tooth device.  It doesn't just go back to playing from the phone it closes.

Pandora,It's alright...,First of all never purchase anything that has something to do about justin beiber,24-May-13,3,"I recently downloaded this app thought it was awesome at first and then it said I had to start paying because I went over the amount of hours. So I was pretty upset about that cause I really like Pandora but I guess I can still use it on a regular computer. Honestly I think a great app for a kindle fire or any tablet would be Iheartradio because its free,you never have to pay and it's somewhat similar to what Pandora gives you and also you can listen to your favorite radio stations. But overall Pandora is an awesome app it just sucks it's not always going to be free."

Example, when I accidently bypassed the correct 'time' setting, it took me 2 days and hours of internet research to find how to reset.

It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however."

When it does it plays a few songs until commercial then locks up again and you get to start over. Constantly reconnect reconnecting. I have better things to do.

Does the same thing on desk top, laptop, tablet and phone.  Need I say more."

Pandora,You prepare your own playlists,Charlie,5-Jul-16,5,"Works exactly like the PC version. In fact, this app does pick up your PC playlists. Very clear sound. If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."

I open it while at the computer, turn the music down low and am comforted while doing whatever on the computer.  Learned the ""hard way"" Pandora uses cell phone data.  Some kind soul advised me to connect to my in home wifi and I would not incur data overage.  One is able to set up their favorite music, Gospel, 60s, 70s, etc. and choose according to their mood which to listen to.  I am probably preaching to the choir.  A nice feature is Pandora is a free app.I am told it can be connected to one's computer.  Haven't tried this yet."

Pandora,Pandora rocks!,Lady Daewyn,9-Jul-15,4,I've been using Pandora for quite sometime. I love being able to customize my stations with the music and bands I want to hear. If I could change one little thing it is to automatically remove Holiday music from my station after the holiday is over. Otherwise it continues to play and I have to thumb it down and add it back manually later. I think it is really easy to use. Some songs will even have lyrics available which is nice if I feel the need to sing along and don't know it well.
Pandora,Four Stars,Noe Alambar,16-Oct-14,4,Love the app !

Pandora,from excited to sadness in minutes,disappointed,9-Jul-15,1,So my BlackBerry did this &#34;major mandatory phone update. So when it finished I has happy to see all these apps that I can't got from the BlackBerry store. This is the 3rd app that I have downloaded and it failed to say why. It opens even but totally unusable. I have been wanting Pandora back for like forever. It would really be a cool thing to do if you opened the app store and it have an option that you could click on that you were either an Android user or a BlackBerry user. I've only downloaded 3 apps and had to just delete thm. A little help Amazon.

If you just want music like a certain artist you might be luckier."

Pandora,Five Stars,LaTia Bernice Moore,18-Jul-14,5,Luv this app I get any music
Pandora,it's always running,Robert Hewes,18-May-14,2,"I like Pandora.  When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc.  When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire.  This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days.  The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated.  I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used!  Some apps never stop running.  This seems to be one of them.  I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that.  If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem.  But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."
Pandora,A+ app,E. S. Moeller,27-Aug-15,5,"This is a great great app! I actually found some people I never even heard of, like Jasmine Thompson, Avril Levigne, and (ikr) Meghan Trainor. They are now some of my favorite singers. The only problem are the ads. They aren't super bad, it's just that they happen at all. It's just a commercial off and on, or ""tap the banner below to go to blah blah blah "".My advice : just don't skip every single song. It makes more commercials! Also, when you skip, you eventually use up all your skips for an hour. Other than that, it's a great app!"

Pandora,Doesn't work on Kindle Fire ???!!?,Jason,3-Oct-15,1,I subscribe to Pandora radio...but I subscribed through GooglePlay 6 months ago.I downloaded the app onto my new Kindle..logged in...and no music.It shows the album art and everything like normal....but not a sound. Maybe because I originally got it through Google??  This is not cool.I'm starting to see this Kindle as a waste of $$ and just as an electronic sales pitch from Amazon. My Pandora works fine on everything else except this Kindle.So 5 stars for Pandora...1 star for whatever reason it won't play on this thing.

Pandora,"Love, Love, Love",Customer,17-Nov-14,5,I have Pandora on everything I own which the app can be added to. I absolutely love it. You can create your own stations to listen to your favorite artists. The only thing about the free app is sometimes they play the same songs over and over in a station but probably wouldn't if you get the paid app.

I want to leave it on all night but it stops playing."

Pandora,Am I the Only One That Finds the Categorization of Music on Pandora Strange?,Ella Brand,14-Dec-16,3,"Great for a free app. I wish there were more ways to extrapolate lesser known artists as opposed to only the obviously famous ones. I feel like I spend more time fast forwarding through songs (which you're only allowed to do so many times before a commercial break) than I am listening to actual music. I also have a problem with how some of the genres populate their songs, artists, etc. I disagree with how a lot of the music winds up getting categorized."

Pandora,"Good, but extremely glitched",Emily,25-Oct-13,3,"I love Pandora, and this app is no exception. It is great to be able to just log in and have a personalized radio. It also exposes you to different music that you would have never thought of listening to. However, that's only when it works. Unfortunately, this app very rarely functions properly on my Kindle Fire HD. It often freezes up, and refuses to do anything except close, and it is also prone to just completely not opening. It is ridiculously annoying. But still, it is a great app, when it works."

Pandora,better options out there in my opinion,Howard B. Mcclain,2-Dec-15,1,"Can only speak to the ""free"" version. Frankly, at the price (free), it is not even close to a bargain.Whatever parameters they use in selecting the music for your personalized ""stations"" are sofar off it is ludicrous. No idea what you get when you pony up their fee, but I sure hope it is anupgrade. There are other, better options out there in my opinion.

Pandora,Beware of commercials,SFDirect,4-Apr-14,1,"The free version has a ridiculous amount of commercials. Initially it wasn't too bad, but the more Pandora was played, the more commercials were played. Also, many of the the pop up ads have an adult theme to them, so beware of the commercial/ad content. I'm sure their idea is to breakdown the user by having so many commercials that they'll download the app with the monthly fee. Boo! :("

Pandora,Like It a Lot,R. Smith,26-Jun-13,4,"I've been a Pandora subscriber for about 2 years.  For me, it's well worth paying for and it's taken the place of our defunct stereo system.  I don't use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music.  I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group.  Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to.  The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music.  Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.  I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that doesn't work for me.  So far, It's a perfect solution for me."

Pandora,&#34;You do not own this app&#34;,Janice White,27-Mar-16,3,My Pandora app has been glitching ever since that message started popping up about a week or 2 or 3  ago (i don't remember exactly when)So I've uninstalled and then redownloaded the app at least 4 times from Google play and twice now from Amazon app store and the message still keeps popping up when I try to use the app. I'm not buying it but I will use the free version in the app stores. So why does it say I don't own it and therefore can't use it [glitch free]?
Pandora,Five Stars,Natalie M.,14-Mar-17,5,thanks

Pandora,Hostage.,frankie,1-Sep-16,1,"Aweful! Worked well at first but it seems the service just gets more annoying the longer you go without upgrading. I can barely get one song to play with out it freezing up, and it not a speed or equipment issue as it does the same thing on several devices and at any speed."
Pandora,Love it. I don't mind ONE commercial here and ...,PITA HEREDIA,30-Nov-14,5,Love it. I don't mind ONE commercial here and There. My only comment is that once in a while you have to uninstall and re install from device or devises even wen you have it regularly updated still tilts from time to time like twice a year. No biggie since it's free and great app.
Pandora,STUPID,Lenita A Moatz,11-Feb-16,1,When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001% of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes. I really love Nightcore and Meghan Trainor Radio but I can't listen to it with all of this happening. _Ÿ˜©_Ÿ˜©_Ÿ˜©_Ÿ˜©_Ÿ˜©. Please fix it and I will raise my rating. Thank you!

Pandora,"TERRIBLE for Kindle Fire HD, works on other Android tablets",C. Russell,18-Jul-13,2,"I use Pandora often on my computer, so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire HD and my daughters' tablets.  While it works fine on the Android tablets, Pandora is a nightmare on the Kindle Fire.  It takes forever to load (and usually multiple tries); it often stops playing for no apparent reason in the middle of songs, and may or may not resume at any given moment; and even if it does play well, when I try to turn Pandora off it won't shut off.  I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit.Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire.  Two stars because it does, in fact, work on other tablets.  DO NOT get the app if you have a Kindle."

Pandora,Awesome,Guillermo Parris,9-Dec-12,4,I listen to all the time and its like having your very own DJ.  I am very pleased with it!
Pandora,Pandora ROCKS!,Tina,6-Aug-15,5,"Have been listening to Pandora for years. I love that I can plug in a 'vibe' I want and get all kinds of music I've never heard of. Have used it for Halloween parties, holiday get-togethers, and my go-to station for work is one of my favorite motion picture score composers. I use Pandora as a way to find other similar artists - this works especially well in classical music. I don't mind the ads - a lot of times I get value from those, too, because the ads are for local deals and specials. Love that I can listen to Pandora on my Kindle while reading, I can access it on my iPad while working out, and I can bluetooth-stream it through my car. I'm always just a click away from my favorite music!"
Pandora,Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and ...,Kindle Customer,18-Mar-15,3,"Pandora is great until I search a Relaxing & Sleep sounds and upon falling asleep, I was startled by an Advertisement announcement.  Well it took another hour to fall back asleep.  I found that to be Add Free, Pandora will accept a MONTHLY FEE of $4.55 not a small one time FEE.  So no more sleep sounds.But Pandora is nice and ok, but I rather use my Kindle Fire and IPhone for my Music Videos.  Oh forgot to say, you have commercial adds even when your Pandora music files, just walk away and you will not see any ads."
Pandora,Pretty cool!,Amazon Customer,2-Nov-16,5,I have only used it for a few days but it seems realy neat.  I can just pick an artist type the name and teh musci from taht artist plays.  Pretty cool!
Pandora,Won't Accept me Signing Up!!!,Harley,2-May-16,4,"So, I got this app and signed up. After I entered my info, it wouldn't let me sign up! I tried new passwords, but to no avail!

Pandora,It's ok,Sandie Toms,21-Dec-12,4,"When i listen to it, it is ok. Don't use it often. This site is new to me and it is ok"
Pandora,Love it!,Kindle Customer,26-Dec-13,5,I heard Pandora playing at someone's house several weeks ago. I decided to sign up for the free version to see what it was like. They do have ads however they are few and far between. There is no comparison to regular radio which bombard you with so many commercials it seems that there are more of them than there is music. With Pandora you can also choose your favorite genres. Most radio stations have a theme but Pandora is much better I think. I will never listen to radio again if Pandora is available.
Pandora,Pandora=awesome,JAMv,26-Dec-12,4,"My music when i want it and i dont have to download it, what can be better. I love it"

Pandora,Needs Improvement,M. Herman,14-Feb-12,3,"It seems the phone app seems to drop songs quite often, not sure if this a Pandora issue or phone, otherwise it's alright."
Pandora,Plays some music that does not match the station name.,Nancie Sayre,4-Aug-16,3,"At first I loved this  and still love parts of it.The issue that I have with it is that when I listen to a Station that I have.They are supposed to play music similar the the title of the  station I am listening to.... it tends to play music that has nothing to do with the station that I am listening to.For example. I have one called ""Loretta Lynn Radio"" She is classic country music .. I have female singers from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline,Kitty Wells,etc....SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music. ??  That is one of the songs that they played on the Loretta Lynn Station."
Pandora,must have,J.R.T.,6-Sep-12,5,"A must  have for anyone that loves music, or for any one who likes to  make  the time past better."
Pandora,excellent,Kindle Customer,10-Jan-13,5,I love the fact you can make your own station. It plays the songs you like. It goes with you.
Pandora,Use it daily! Best app across platforms.,James R. Purcell,12-Dec-11,5,"I have no idea what others are complaining about.  I have pro subscription so I don't get ads, but runs great on all my devices."
Pandora,Where did the sleep timer go?,Rachel Van Court,13-Nov-13,3,"I saw that a sleep timer had been added, but with the new update it is gone again. What happened? The only reason I put this app on my kindle was so I could fall asleep to relaxing music."
Pandora,FREE And Less Commercials Than Radio; Streaming Doesn't Count Towards Data Usage On T-Mobile,MyBeesWax,6-Feb-15,5,"I got this app for my Kindle and Android phone and now I have music everywhere I go. It's much better than radio. ""Reception"" is crystal clear and it has less (a lot less!) commercials than radio. Commercial interruptions are tolerable and the content of the commercials are even relevant sometimes. And if you're willing pay a monthly subscription fee (currently 4.99, up from 3.00 when it was introduced in 2009), you get  advertising-free music. Last, I shouldn't forget to mention that if you have T-Mobile (I do), music streaming on Pandora doesn't count towards your data usage. SWEEEET!"
Pandora,Music to my ears,Brenda Ringler,6-May-14,5,Love it!
Pandora,Pandora Music Service,BigTSpear,15-May-16,4,"Pandora is a great music service. Free version of App has minimal commercials. Primarily interruption free listening. Create account, preferences, get recommended music. Account accessible from any device. Listen anywhere. Definitely would download again."
Pandora,Interesting concept,MBW,12-Apr-14,3,"The obvious good is that I get to choose which songs I want and I can create several different stations for different types of music.  The part I don't like is that it seems to want me to continuously interact with it to tell it what I like and don't like.  It also tests my patience by throwing in songs that I do not want.  I don't want a radio station that I have to babysit.  I prefer music to just ""be on"" in the background.  The best time to set up a Pandora account is on a long car trip, so that I had several hours to fine-tune my stations."
Pandora,good Android radio app,Dalt,19-Nov-12,5,Just a great free app for music on my global two Android. Good music at a great price. That's plenty.
Pandora,I find the loop of music too short. I ...,Vivian deGeorges,29-Nov-14,3,"I find the loop of music too short.  I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which shouldn't be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there.  Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens.  Yes, I'm on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I'd hear at least a lot of that music.  But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction.  I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I don't mind them.  I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I'd get a longer time between repeat songs, but that's not what no-ads means, so I'm not sure that would solve the problem."
Pandora,amazing,kroberson,11-Jan-12,5,the best stream radio i wanted one song i love but instead it not only gave me that song/artistubut many more just like it
Pandora,Very nice.,Amazon Customer,24-Oct-11,5,"I can't stop using this app. Very enjoyable. No problems so far. Who doesn't like having music of their choice anytime, anywhere?"
Pandora,LOVE IT and HATE IT,John Smith,16-Sep-16,5,"Love every purpose intended.... but like when I run out of skips it happens to stations I have listened to in days. And a few times every time I skip it sometimes plays the same song back to back three times in a row. Other than the stupid, small flaws.... I love it"
Pandora,great app,JXP,21-Jan-12,5,why is everyone crying about free music???? this app is awesome Works great plays exactly what I want to hear every time.
Pandora,annoying,Kindle Customer,2-Feb-17,1,it keeps coming on when I'm doing something else on another menu. I can't get rid of it unless I completely close down my device.
Pandora,Pandora: Nothing Better,Tom Dennett,14-Apr-13,5,"Pandora is the best app (or internet site) out there. Your music, all the time with only a few short ads every 10 songs or so (they have to make money some how). I am a child of the 70's so my Eagles Radio gives me all the classic rock I could ever want. The pre-programmed stations are great too.  Gotta love a little disco from time to time on 70's radio. And sometimes I even like a little country. Listen at home on the internet, on your smart phone, tablet.. and of course Kindle. Wifi or 3 or 4 G.  Make your own station based on any of your favorite bands.  The more music you ""like"" the more customized it becomes. thumbs down and you never hear it again."
Pandora,Five Stars,mary gergel,23-Jun-16,5,love it
Pandora,Not the best version,FOX,25-Jan-13,3,It plays well but I feel limited in how it plays. The screen is clear but not easy to use.
Pandora,It's okay,DR,20-Apr-14,3,okay
Pandora,it's been acting up,A. K. Portillo,2-Jan-14,1,I love Pandora but lately it's been refreshing in the middle of a song and starts a new one. It also just shuts down if you are on silk for more than couple of minutes. Like maybe two songs at most. I know that if you don't like a song for a while it will as you if you are still listening but it's not like that. It will just shut down completely. I like listing to Pandora while I'm browsing the Internet on silk but now I can't. Please fix
Pandora,Poor Qualtiy and Selecton,Joseph Sarazin,13-Feb-15,2,"I find that when you create a radio station that the same songs play over and over again.  In my case I created several 'radio stations' based on performers such as  Simon & Garfunkel.  I know S & G have recorded many songs but only heard three or four of them along with a lot of other performers music that was of only marginal interest to me.  If you skip too many songs - you get a message that is not allowed as often as you like.I also found over the two months I tried using it that most of the music was from albums recorded at  'live' events, I prefer the higher quality studio songs - I don't seem to have any choice in the issue.  No longer using Pandora."
Pandora,self-explanatory Pandora app,Joan Barylski,16-Feb-15,4,"It's free! With adverts. And you have to create a Pandora account or sign in with an existing one. :P And you can only use it while connected to the internet, which makes sense, but is a bit of a bummer. No airplane mode with this one! It took me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it's fairly simple, so I think I've got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet. I think it's best suited for people already familiar with Pandora, but I recommend it for anyone who's online and wants some music!"
Pandora,It is Ok,Debbie Lucksted,13-Jan-13,3,I like I hart radio better. I have only listened to it once. . . . . . . .
Pandora,love it,Cooki,8-May-12,4,Ok so I discovered Pandora and fell in love with it. I like that I can change and create my own stations.
Pandora,hi,richard,12-Jan-13,4,it is not that good but it a app what can u do lol so get it or dont haha
Pandora,Love Pandora,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-13,5,"Works great, easy download and streams well.... .. . . . . . . . . . . . ."
Pandora,very good music variety,scott from fl,2-Apr-14,5,"Put this on my Kindle and also my computer as I really enjoy listening to music.  When you enter an artist, you get a mix of that artist along with similar artists.  You can put in multiple artists and put the music on shuffle and it will go back and forth between artists/genres.  Although not significant, I have found that the information/lyrics are sometimes incorrect.  For example, I can't remember who they said wrote the song OHIO, but it was not the correct artist-it was written by Neil Young.  Not generally a big deal or problem.  I have opted to not pay the 3.99/mo to get Pandora commercial free as they are all less than 30 seconds and for me are not bothersome."
Pandora,review,randyjr,17-Mar-12,3,its ok but needs better options for phone. your music genre is next to none. volume control would be awesome.
Pandora,yes I am so new at this...I love being able to find my favorites.,Twilight Young,23-Jan-13,5,I would recommend  this to anyone that I know that has Kindle.  I was surprised at the quality of music on my Kindle.
Pandora,this an awesome app,N.Sciortino,4-Feb-12,5,best app i downloaded for my tablet. if you want to listen to music when ever you want i HIGHLY RECOMEND this app
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,28-Sep-16,5,I like the fact I'm able to pick the songs i like
Pandora,My favorite app!  I use this every day!,Weez,26-Jun-15,5,"I absolutely love Pandora!  I choose to add the monthly subscription (it's like $3.99 a month) and the subscription is totally worth it.  Regular Pandora has occasional ads that you can't skip but with the subscription there are no ads.  I use this app every day, I have all my favorite stations trained to play my favorite songs all the time.  I have even found new artists and songs I didn't know existed as Pandora will occasionally add a random new song or artist into the mix."
Pandora,"My account shows that I have this app, but ...",Heather,25-Sep-16,1,"My account shows that I have this app, but I don't - Every time I click on it, it says my 'session has timed out' (although I just tried opening it) and other times it says that 'an account cannot be set up for me at this time' (or words to that effect)."
Pandora,Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want,Kathleen molitor,8-Nov-15,3,I have a complaint. . . My Elvis Presley channel plays one to two of Elvis songs in a hour. I hear more Waylon and Johnnie cash than Elvis. The same goes for all the other channels I set. Why set up your favorite artists when you play what you want?
Pandora,auto closes before i can start uses,lance pettitt,24-May-14,1,Another ap that won't open just goes back to home screen of the kindle. Very annoying.  (But hey that's what my droid and iPod are for.....right?)
Pandora,User unfriendly,JD,10-Mar-15,1,"Pandora used to have a nice interface.  Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed.  You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program.  It doesn't support the menu button.  It turns on and off randomly, so you can't let it idle in the background.  Perfect,  now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car,  leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and  blare music.  When I'm  in a meeting or library.  Awesome.... Fix your app,  Pandora.  There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance.  I know that I would never pay for premium  these issues."
Pandora,what was the point???,Moniquevt,16-May-16,4,"I love the app but one problem: the comment section.  People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand  post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information.  And I keep saying, "" do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen."". And people are just being inappropriate.  So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."
Pandora,Dont like their official app,Rye Guy,20-Feb-15,1,Too many ads
Pandora,Free music,Tamara Woods,6-Sep-13,5,I use al the time instead of playing my radio at home and in the car. This app is a must have.
Pandora,starting to hate ...,Scott Smith,22-Nov-11,2,why all of a sudden it only play 1 minute of every song but plays complete commercials??????? Get this fixed ASAP!!!
Pandora,Great,Kindle Customer,4-Sep-16,5,"Love this! However, too many and too long pauses. Guess I'm having trouble with streaming. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
Pandora,got the droid x update,Kris,24-Feb-12,5,Got the droid x update and now it doesn't shut down on me anymore! Love it! Works better than slacker imo
Pandora,Music I like at my fingertips,Lynn Nelson,30-Dec-13,5,"My neighbor helped me sign-up on Pandora.  We were able to listen to great, instrumental Christmas music.  Now I can listen to many different varieties of music that my wife and I enjoy.  Mostly easy-listening.  I have a wireless speaker that I can take to any room I want and the music is right there.  What a treat.  No more crap radio."
Pandora,awesome but ......... adds,Kevin Mauser,24-Jun-15,5,"I give this a 5 star rating because I am really stuck to music, and it is free!!! I can create new stations. But the big deal is adds. Every song I play, I leave my fire on my bed and listen to an add, and another one comes on. UUUUURRRRRGGGGG!!!!! So I almost put a 4 star rating._Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜ . But my _Ÿ’œ (heart) told me not to. So I didn't. I told my mom last night I wish that there were NO adds in the world. But I have really great station's like Dove Camron or Ariana Grande."
Pandora,Same Songs,Amazon Customer,14-Nov-16,3,"I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I sometimes hear the same songs over and over again - in the same order. It's getting a little aggravating, because even though I like those songs, I don't want to hear the same ones in the same order every time I listen to a station. I've only noticed it happening on the Pop Rock radio I have, thankfully. Pandora often offers me a new song when I first click on the station, but it's usually a song I don't like (and I'm not holding that against them, of course). So I'll put a thumbs down. But then I get the same songs all over again. It's quite frustrating."
Pandora,No Remedy,Glenn S Sales,3-Sep-15,1,"Worked great for 4 months, but now will not play at all!  This is the second phone (HTC ONE M9) that this has happened to. The other phone was a Galaxy S4, the situation could never be resolved on that phone either. I have been a paying subscriber for a long time now, but that ends today. Too many people have the same problem as I do and Pandora's solution does not work. I hate to say goodbye to Pandora but I don't feel that I have any choice. Thank you."
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Piazzashell,18-Jul-16,5,I have been using Pandora for years now and I absolutely adore the service! I must have 15 custom-created stations on it . Not only do i enjoy music I know but it also gives me the opportunity to hear new music and artists I have never heard before.
Pandora,Tired of it taking over my camera....,Lora,6-Apr-16,1,This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone.
Pandora,Disappointing,D.I.Y-Lila,6-Jul-17,2,"I am 10 and I have no idea what a zip code is! I can't sign in! I thought you just get to hear music, but no! I uninstalled because I don't want to go though all this stuff... Darn it :("
Pandora,Good music app,Alani Scott,4-Oct-16,4,Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are looking for a good music app this is it.
Pandora,Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in ...,David D.,10-May-16,3,"I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the $15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they didn't have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
Pandora,No...,Serenity23,4-Jun-16,1,Took it off my tablet almost as soon as I put it on.  Not a huge fan of Pandora and didn't like the way the app worked.
Pandora,I loved how there was a programming bug at one point ...,S. PARKINSON,2-Aug-15,3,"Pandora app works as intended, however having a video add literally every 2-3 songs is a bit excessive. I loved how there was a programming bug at one point of time that caused AD interruptions, however seems like that has been since fixed. The only other thing I can think of is how it recommends like artists for your playlist. Very redundant on songs, little variety. Some recommendations are complete outside the genre that you are listening to. Songs that I have downvoted still play, it is a very broken system. If Grooveshark wouldn't have been shut down, I would definitely not be using Pandora. Needs improvement for sure."
Pandora,"Excited, and then...",Jose Guillermo Luque Sanchez,8-May-14,1,"I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and...  It didn't work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it doesn't work everywhere. It just works in the US.Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I couldn't even use it, so, what's the point?Thanks, and put useful to this review, please.Oh, I think you'd like hotspot fm. Look for I, it's free.Thanks"
Pandora,I Love this App,Hollie W.,29-Oct-16,5,Love this app. I can listen to all my favorite artists and it selects music according to what I have listened to. Only downside is you can only skip 5 songs at a time and then you have to listen to what they have chosed.
Pandora,Love Pandora,S. Granados,14-Nov-16,5,"I love this app, and will continue to use it even with the other apps out there. Pandora will forever be my favorite one. I wish it was free from ads, but I guess that is why you have the option to buy it without ads"
Pandora,pure amazing!,HayHay Hamrick 2000,3-Jun-13,5,This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!
Pandora,Pandora created a day spa station for me!,Teri E.,30-Jul-15,5,"Pandora makes it super easy to assemble music of the same genre. I have created a lot of radio stations, but when I made a station from one particularly relaxing track (by David and Steve Gordon), Pandora found more music like it than I ever expected to find. I love discovering new titles and learning about the artists. This station is like being at a spa every time I hear the selection of music that Pandora plays. I hope Pandora will always be around."
Pandora,Pandora Great,Bus Driver Bill,5-Mar-12,4,Great i love it you can mix your music to the way you like it and its all free.Did i say free.
Pandora,SMOOTH JAZZ,Sweet Tee,4-Feb-16,5,"I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......A+++++++"
Pandora,MyPandora,CDub775,24-Mar-17,5,I rated this app 5 stars because of how im able to personalize my stations and how wide the variety of music is I LOVE PANDORA!!!!
Pandora,Great software!,Steve Craig,6-Nov-16,5,"How can you not love Pandora? Whatever music you want, when you want it."
Pandora,Pandora,Vicki Ling,18-Jan-13,5,It is a great way to hear your favorite music when using your Kindle for another app. I also like the fact I can listen wherever I can use my Kindle.
Pandora,Could always be better,Andrea Lindauer,23-Jan-14,4,"I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."
Pandora,Pandora is the best music program we have ever experienced.,ezboomer,9-May-14,5,My wife and I chose this app. after we purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The variety of music with Pandora isthe best we have ever heard. Many of the album cuts by the artists you choose and others are cuts wehave never heard and it's always a pleasure to hear a song by a favorite artist for the first time.Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I aren't looking.We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Roku and Smart TV's.We highly recommend Pandora for all music lovers and the variety it brings to your life.
Pandora,I love it,Adama66,6-Dec-13,5,nice
Pandora,Better than listening to the radio!!!,Kohaku,5-Mar-16,5,I purchased the Pandora One subscription. There are several things I enjoy about Pandora. I have been able to check my favorites list when I wanted to check out a song I've heard for the first time I liked. Being able to give a song a thumbs up or down helps control which songs I want on rotation too. You can use the free Pandora with all the same features too. The only difference is the free version contains ads.

Everytime I  hit ""uninstall"" on my amazon appstore the appstore completely closes. Very dissapointed"
Pandora,Music Made My Way,Betty B,1-Mar-15,5,Pandora is one of the greatest inventions to come from the internet.  Thank you to the creator!  I love being able to put on music customized to my specific likes and moods. This is a must have for everyone.  Who doesn't like music?!  The commercials every so often are annoying but I'm too cheap to purchase ad free listening.
Pandora,Great app for phone: pandora,Barbara,16-Jul-16,5,I've been a Pandora subscriber for years and only recently added this app to my phone.  The same channels I created for my laptop/desktop automatically are there with phone app. No set up or cumbersome issues to get started with app
Pandora,Beyond Awesome!!,Lori9898,24-Jan-12,5,I got this app for my T301 and it's AWESOME!  I can jam to the radio all day long for FREE!
Pandora,Waaaaaaaaaay too many ads and limitations,DigitalMD,1-Dec-12,2,"Used to be ok, but now is loaded with ads you have to watch or listen too and limitations , they try to force you to subscribe at $5 a month.  No thanks,  Removed."
Pandora,This is ridiculous!,miranda,26-May-14,1,I didn't even get a chance to listen to music on Pandora because it will load on my Kindle for literally 2 seconds and then it says it timed out then goes back to the home screen. Seriously! It timed out after 2 seconds! I would rate this 0 stars if I could. I love Pandora the app works on my phone but why not this. I am uninstalling and reinstalling and hope that it is fixed.
Pandora,"hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you ...",Fran Reyes,13-Nov-16,5,"This site enables you to pick that one singer that you want to hear more of and create your station, voila, there you are, hearing your favorite singer, you can create as many stations you want, I have 7!!"
Pandora,Alarm clock feature broken,Derek,16-Dec-16,1,"Whether it's Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
Pandora,Would get 5 stars if the buffering wasn't so long!,Cameron K.,10-Jun-16,4,I like this app but the buffering is driving me crazy!I have a Kindle Fire and the app buffers like crazy at the beginning when you start to use it.Once it starts and you get the station or music you like its ok at that time.
Pandora,PERFECT,William B.,13-Jan-17,5,"Absolutely LOVE it......I am 57 y/o and completely new to this .......... for 1st day after getting first BT Speaker for working out n shop SO  The 1st day I tried that Heart station and within less than 4 hours started getting repeats and it was like having a short mp3 playlist ....got irritating and boing Real Quick...........DAY 2  Broke the HEART  and installed Pandora, clicked Jack Johnson station and  BLISS,  eclectic mix  and  it has been 3 days now and if there have been repeats I have not noticed because I am TOO Busy dancing and Loving it 100% !!  PERFECT"
Pandora,Pandora Music,Gudrun Greetan,11-Aug-16,5,Best music app - listen to it every day.  Option to block explicit lyrics is genius. Thumbs down on a song means you never have to hear it again.  Thumbs up and you get more songs similar to that one.  Absolutely brilliant.
Pandora,Love Pandora!,D_Thorn,28-Oct-14,5,"I use this for when I'm working on the computer or reading.  A lot of different channels, but I tend to have a core set of about 8-9 that I listen to all the time.  Also appreciate that Pandora can be set up to play when my Kindle is in sleep mode --  helps save on the battery.  It also doesn't seem to interfere with the other applications -- although it will occasionally distort slightly (not all the time) when performing certain actions on a game or pulling up e-mail."
Pandora,Most used app I have,Peaches H2oman,25-Mar-17,5,Used everyday at work to listen to music makes work more bearable

The commercials are brief and few , so the free version is still very good . It was very user friendly and simple to navigate through . I think this is a good app ."
Pandora,Pandora Media Review,Z. C. Wilkins,22-Jan-13,5,"I really do like this app.  My niece turned me on to this app.  It is a great music media app, it to me is one of the best apps for music.  I really do like the different genres for music.  The music really sounds good on the Kindle Fire HD, because of the dolby audio sound system.  I could listen to it all day long.  I would and have recommended it to friends."
Pandora,Best music streaming app.,Faith G.,14-Feb-14,5,"I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available.  They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres.  Great job Pandora."
Pandora,It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request,Amazon Customer,9-Nov-16,5,I'm impressed.  It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request.  No complaints.
Pandora,Just my honest option on this app I prefer utube,Trisha saler,16-May-16,1,I didn't like this app because when I used it I didn't see video w it unlike utube it was boring just starring at my tablet watching the bands picture.i guess this is for music when ur on the go not for viewing
Pandora,LOOOOOOVE,Taryn C.,11-Nov-16,5,"I love Pandora. It doesn't repeat songs over and over, it has almost evey artist younwould want. Love this, a total must have. Except for the fact that you habento pay for premium, but whatever."
Pandora,Five Stars,Jacqueline Kennedy,4-Nov-16,5,I love listening to my gospel music on this station
Pandora,Gteat idea just needs a little more development.,John Bund,31-Oct-16,3,The idea of the program is great. But there are problems. One that occurs routinely is the loss of signal. The program will need to buffer. When that happens I need to open the application manager to force a program stop. Then when the program is reloaded it works again. Until the next time. A little more variety in audio programming would be good
Pandora,Music Major,raddad51x,1-Mar-13,5,"I love music. I love all sorts of different music.I love that I can go anywhere in my home, like the basement, garage, bedroom or take a shower, and still have the type of music play that I am in the mood for.From the '60s to Spanish Guitar to Eclectic, I have it all.I love the portability of it on my Kindle."
Pandora,Spotify it better!,Meglis family,23-Feb-15,1,"Now Listen,Spotify is better because you can pick what songs you want to here! on pandora ypu have to wait until you find a song you like,Trust me spotify is better because when you get the game you can get a 7 day trial that lets you listen to your songs where ever you want (Without WiFi) and it gives you better quality and NO ADS (Even know there is not a lot of ads and it only has ads about GOOD songs) and Pandora gives you an ad after every song! And you can get spotify Premium but its like 10/20 dollars every Month witch is not that bad...But dont worry spotify is already good!And on spotify you can change the quality in your settings.Oh yeah i forgot to tell you on spotify right after your trial runs out you might need to reset your profile because it well start to not let you listen to your music (Maybe) and i hate that ad on pandora about Jim Carlyles.com its so annoying,But anyways i don't recommend this App unless you want to hear an ad after every song!"

Pandora,Awesome App!,RandiMarie23,8-Apr-14,5,Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great  was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying.
Pandora,Perfect. I have to chuckle every time I realize ...,DottieDear,27-Feb-16,5,Music just for me.  Perfect.  I have to chuckle every time I realize that the new station I just set up plays some of the songs from my old stations.  Apparently I have very consistent tastes in music.
Pandora,music,B. Woollen,23-Jan-13,4,It plays good music but it isn't very loud when the vol;ume of my kindle is on high.  I would play it more if it was louder.
Pandora,play what I want ...not pandora,steven juzwak,31-Mar-15,3,"The fact that Pandora continues to add ""stations""  turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that's what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great."
Pandora,Not for me,Novelist,7-Feb-15,1,Didn't care for it. I never was able to assemble a good play list. Too much repetition of songs I didn't like.
Pandora,Pandora fits the bill,Big Daddy,25-Jan-16,4,Love Pandora radio - good variety of stations to choose from or make up your own.  Pick a band you like and Pandora will create a station with your band of choice along with other singers or groups that fall into the same genre.  Overall its a quality listening experience that you can take anywhere.
Pandora,music,goldie,23-Aug-13,5,ok
Pandora,I've discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to.,John E.,6-Jun-16,5,"I can't live without my Pandora now. Takes a little patience to develop the perfect playlist (like a couple/three sessions of thumbs up or down), but it's SO worth it. I've discovered a lot of new music I might never have otherwise been exposed to."
Pandora,Never downloaded,Valerie Banta,9-Dec-16,1,Was never able to download it so how can I review it?
Pandora,"sometimes good, sometimes not quite",Amazon Customer,17-May-16,4,"Works well and introduces you to new music similar to the station you choose. sometimes good, sometimes not quite. Still, a good way to learn and appreciate all the great music there is.  Just wish in the Classical stations they would play the entire piece rather than movements or excerpts.  Guess listening to something longer than a few minutes is very old school."
Pandora,Love it!,cinderella47025,22-Apr-14,4,"I'm still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. It's nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"
Pandora,love it,Kindle Customer,28-Jan-17,5,"Great app, works well only droid maxi."
Pandora,Problems with pandora,Maryann Cole,9-Oct-16,5,"I like Pandora. I would like you to do something for me. I have cerebral palsy and I like the best of Ronnie dove, and dusty Springfield.

Thank you for your attention."
Pandora,The best!,Dianna L. Gutoski,28-Feb-15,5,Pandora is the Best invention to happen to music!  Where else can you Create your own radio stations according to your mood and the artists you like!  I listen to them every day as much as possible.  Amazon radio does not give you the choices. And it gives you information about the artist as it plays.  An awesome way to discover new music and artists.  Who needs old fashioned radio anymore?!  Get it now!You won't be sorry.

Pandora,Also the UI isn't super intuitive i,VS,12-Sep-16,3,"Not sure how to Close app on my Kindle (no 'x' top right to close). Other issues (delay, long silent pauses) may be due to my device, or cable connectivity (10GB), not the app, but I'm unclear.

Pandora,Great to Find New Music,Sean in LI,19-Dec-15,5,"Pandora and their patented Music Genome Project tech allows them to play new music to you based on your listening history.The recommendations are almost always perfect, allowing me to hear new music I never would have encountered without Pandora. I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste."
Pandora,I used to love Pandora.,brandi perugini,9-Feb-17,2,"I used to love Pandora.... however, recently the variety is limited and with the free version the ads were unbearable and way too frequent. Uninstalled, I now use the YouTube music app. No ads, and free with as much variation as I want."

Pandora,If You Love Music - This Is For You,iamjazzy,14-May-16,5,I have been listening to Pandora for many years - I first saw it advertised when I was on the AARP internet page on the computer which belonged to my job - which I have retired from - it was advertised as Pandora Jukebox. I have it downloaded on my computer at home and my iPhone. I like that I get to choose the music I like to listen to - and I get to rate it. If I don't enjoy one of the songs that they are playing - I can stop it and go to the next one. I recommend Pandora to anyone who loves music as much as I do..

Pandora,Please do not get.,therese gill,5-Feb-13,1,"One time I was listening to it (once it logged me properly) and I exited out. For some strange reason Selena Gomez was still singing. I logged into Twitter, still singing. It went to the next song (Jessie J, I believe). I shut it off and Jessie J continued to sing. I had to hold the power button down for 20 seconds, let go, and hold it down for 3 more seconds (that is how I re-boot my Kindle). I deleted the app the second my Kindle powered back up. I told all my friends and family about it, and now I'm telling you. Please fix this."

Pandora,Internet Radio at its finest.,kayetee,28-Jul-15,5,"Its the evolution of broadcast radio, but better.  I knew Pandora was available online, but I was delighted to find an app for it that works with my KindleFire. The sound is incredible. This app easily plays in the background while reading an e-book or surfing the web.  I program only the types of music that I want to hear and it provides the lyrics to most songs, allowing you to become familiar with the artists, the titles and the albums of the songs you are hearing for future purchase, if you so choose."
Pandora,AWESOMENESS,Alyssa,5-May-14,5,"This is a really great app. I find the type of music that I want to listen to and go search, play games, or do whatever. Also it has free music . If you have a kindle fire (which i have) then you will love Pandora most of the songs on Pandora (that are good) are free and if you go on the buy music on Amazon it cost money but here on Pandora it's just FREE MUSIC. Tell me if this review helped. Well that's it hope you have a great time on Pandora. BYE"
Pandora,Why I switched to Spotify.,joe sengir,28-Apr-16,3,A frustrating app at times. It will occasionally pop up an overly that demands you either give the song its showing a thumb up or a thumb down. The only way to regain control of the app with out giving a thumb up or a thumb down is to exit the app and restart it. Very annoying. Paying for premium does not give unlimited skips like Spotify does.

Pandora,Beyond a radio stand in; still the best music discovery tool,Yasue,24-Mar-17,5,"I love Pandora and have been following it since the beginning. I told my dad that it would be everywhere one day and, I'll be darned if it isn't standard in a lot of cars and TVs now. It still beats all the new services, like Spotify, since I think the system of music ""DNA"" they use is better at creating channels that introduce you to new music."

Pandora,Great App But.....,puppylover,17-Nov-14,4,This app is really cool for like parties and get togethers but most of the time when you done like a song as soon as you go to skip the song a ad pops up and you end up clicking the add and it lags your device. One thing I really like about Pandora is that when you give a song a thumbs down it says that they will never play that song again. I don't know if that's true. I really like this app you should get it
Pandora,Pandora,Amazon Customer,15-Jan-17,4,"Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad, but it doesn't repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group."
Pandora,Love it; listen to it constantly!,Kindle Customer,15-Jun-16,4,Exposed to a huge variety of music.  I didn't realize the many different types of music and artist I liked.  Con: classical music will be truncated - you will not hear an entire symphony
Pandora,Frustrating,Amazon Customer,23-May-17,2,Can only get one song to play before Pandora freezes.
Pandora,Pandora NO TuneIn YES,Sandy,31-Dec-11,3,"A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try.  It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)Why?First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSICJust sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right?  That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is.  Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, CajunYUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right?  WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world.  Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and  - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"".  Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied!  But wait?  What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257""  Wait??  You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback.  TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."
Pandora,Love it,SKL-Tampa,10-Nov-15,5,Love Pandora and the great variety available for the song mix It's easy to use whether listening to one genre or choosing to shuffle. I'm technologically challenged (seriously) & until recently only listened on my desktop Now I listen on my tablet everywhere I go.
Pandora,it a place to listen to music,Amazon Customer,9-Mar-17,4,I have been using pandora for a few year love this music stations you can make so much freedom to do what you want but there adds so only 4 stari know they need to make money but every time you skip a song play a add overkill... still a great place to listen to music if you want to start it and forget about so you do other thing and not have start a new video are pick new song every time a song ends.
Pandora,only one minor problem,rgd,22-Jan-13,4,"Pandora is free, it's great for finding new music in a particular genre.  The only problem is, it keeps playing after you exit the app,  That's great if you want music while you work on other things, but not so great if you do not,  I cannot find any way to shut it off other than turning the whole Kindle off."
Pandora,welcome music lovers!,Sherri Hogan,22-Mar-13,4,"This app is great!  Love the ideas it gives you for similar music and artists!  Also like shuffle feature and abilityto control which artist or genres it shuffles. Only thing that's mildly irritating is how slowly it goes back and forthto show you info re. artist, words to lyrics, similar artists, etc. But that could be my Kindles problem or internetspeed.  Over all I love it!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Tessa Conner,28-Apr-17,5,Learns what I like.

Pandora,terrible,Kindle Customer,16-Jun-14,1,"You shouldn't get this app. I would go off while you are playing a game, or searching on the internet. Also if you create your own playlist it wouldn't even play most of the songs you put on there. It has barely any songs. It only has popular songs, or popular artists. So I recommend you to get spotify instead"
Pandora,Great if your on Wifi,Spark Tamer,28-Aug-16,4,Pandora is great for finding music similar to what I like. I use it on my PC all the time. I don't use it on my phone much since it uses the cell data plan when not on Wifi. It would be great if it would download say 30 minutes of music to listen to off-line. Then I could use it on my commute to/from work and such without paying me for cell data.
Pandora,OK,blondie,25-Mar-17,3,OK
Pandora,Spectacular!,Brandon,18-Sep-14,5,"I LOVE Pandora!  I can listen to all my favorite artists and songs with the push of a button (or touch of a screen, rather).  The only downside is that you can't search specific songs.  You just have to create a station and hope for the song you want to hear.  Another great feature is that you can listen to stuff other than music too.  I have a comedy station that brings up comedian routines, not songs."
Pandora,Better than a radio!!,schooner,19-Jul-16,5,You can pick your own great tunes and is super easy to navigate if you want to skip a song.  It's great for grouping similar artists without one having to do it themselves.
Pandora,Frustrated,Tara,4-Oct-13,3,"I keep getting a constant message saying ""sorry, we have no more songs to play on this station,please select another."" I reported it numerous times to Pandora and I get the same response from them ""were sorry for the frustration..try this...were sorry try this...and try that..."" I've deactivated my account 4 times and it still keeps happening. I have Pandora One which is $3.99 a month and I'm ready to cancel it."

I love picking my own type of music and choosing or deleting songs by a particular artistuntil I only have songs I love from that artist!It is free if you do not mind some quick commercials, or you may purchase the site for amonthly rate or by the year."
Pandora,Five Stars,Deborah Belcher,9-Mar-17,5,Awesome app
Pandora,horrible,miku,31-Aug-13,1,Its flat out horrible you have to have a account and also Its such a waste of time and when I tried to actually search for a song it kept saying you need to register and I even tried un download ing it and redownloading it and it still acted up oSo what ever you do don't download this app it will not be worth it and also I think I sound is even a better radio app than this so why even bother with this I say screw it
Pandora,Needs to be updated,Morgan quint,23-Jun-16,1,"There's no app for phone, it times out, the setup is confusing, and the box that cost $200 doesn't show what bands are playing or channel. The channels,how ever, are amazing."
Pandora,Alright on Fire,Th3BlackHand,29-Apr-17,3,"I love Pandora so this is a review of the app for amazon. It kinda sucks on Fire, but i'm going to assume that's because I purchased a marginally acceptable $39 tablet.."
Pandora,"I love it, in a way",Khaulah Naima Nuruddin,10-Jul-16,4,"I love it, in a way. The stations seem lazy. I wish there were more perfectness about the songs chosen, more variety. This could be a result of my clicking patterns...or not..."

Pandora,There's nothing like hearing the tunes you like sounding so smooth and ...,wiggieworm,19-Jun-17,5,There's nothing like hearing the tunes you like sounding so smooth and mellow. I just like listening to my favorite tunes on Pandora.
Pandora,BSOD,aas1985,19-Nov-13,2,"Used to work great, then stopped.  I updated hoping it would fix it but made it worse.  It used to begin playing eventually after a few times of exiting and restarting program.  Now, it usually won't.  Also,  I play lullabies for my baby (when it works) and before the update there were rarely commercials.  Now loud, multiple ones play at random, which is fine when she is awake, sucks when she just dozed off."
Pandora,I do not understand why pandora is popular,Dr. XYZ,21-Nov-14,1,pandora is not a good product when compared to Rdio as Rdio not only lets you play stations but let you pick individual songs and listen to playlists and publisher playlists and there's a Roku station Android iTunes everything just a great product. I used Pandora for a while but I was so sick of the repetitiveness in the poor music selection that I have given up on them forever
Pandora,Pandora is my go to,Stephanie Lang,11-Sep-15,5,"I have Pandora on every device we own as a family. I have been using it for years. It is great for all ages and I even pay for Pandora One on my personal device, Love having no commercials. But even with commercials its great. All types of music and even kids songs! Plug it in your car, we use at cook outs, camping, just around the house while cleaning!"
Pandora,Total noise and disruptive w/ the frequency and number of ads,MyBot,21-Aug-14,2,"The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app.  I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype, I was totally disappointed."
Pandora,Claimed sleep timer doesn't exist in March 2014 Android update,Anonymous,12-Mar-14,2,"I've loved using this app on my Kindle Fire very frequently in the past but since updating, the sleep timer isn't listed in the drop-down menu or anywhere else. I tried emailing Pandora Media about it but the link doesn't work and they don't provide any other way to contact them. If they fix this and put the sleep timer back in their menu, they will get three stars from me. I won't go to give stars because of their very invasive permissions. They don't need all that info and its none of their business!"
Pandora,Good free music product,Old Timer,17-Apr-13,5,I am enjoying exploration of this product to hear country music from the 50's.  I would recommend the free version.  I'm not ready for the monthly charge version yet!
Pandora,The most extensive music variety on the planet!,Patricia Van Dorst,12-Apr-14,5,"Pandora is quite simply the go-to destination when you are looking for a particular genre of music you can dial in and let play.  It's never let me down for variety of newer and older favorites of whatever type of music I am in the mood for and the best thing is, you can take it anywhere.  I like having it on my phone for portability in the car to hook up to my cars stereo or at home on my computer or stereo.  Wherever you are, wherever you go, be it near or far, it's Pandora!"
Pandora,I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it,kimberlina1793,17-Jan-17,5,"I used to use slacker radio all the time but i have recently switched to Pandora just for the option to mix my stations together. I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it. I do wish it would be easier to use with other devices, I usually hook up my laptop to my TV to use my whole house sound system while I'm cleaning, it would be so much easier to just play it from the Playstaion."

I absolutely love pulling up Pandora's 'oldies' stations on my tablet, plugging in the earphones and relaxing while my wife watches reality TV shows. ;o)Pandora is a pleasant surprise."
Pandora,Awful,Shirolet Mann,17-May-16,1,"I chose 50s country.  Rockabilly, with Patsy Cline, Rick Nelson, and others played for a few minutes. Not necessarily my favorite,  but not bad.Then out of the blue, the next song began playing horrible lyrics, with the ""F bomb"" repeating, over and over and OVER, as I frantically tried to close it.Last time I checked,  50s country did NOT have those lyrics!!!I exited that app, never to return. I'll stick to my ""iheart radio,"" thank you."

Pandora,Oldie But Goodie,Amazon Customer,21-Jan-13,5,"I get to listen to all the old songs I remember as a child while I do my schoolwork.

Pandora,All day listener,N Clark,23-Sep-16,4,"I enjoy Pandora and listen daily at work for lengthy periods. My only issue is that for the number of available songs within a specific genre, I'd prefer not to hear the same set of songs every two hours. The ability to add or remove artists to a channel has become more difficult while on mobile."
Pandora,Pandora isn't a true world wide company!,Sheri Herndon,12-Jun-16,1,Wish i could give less than a star. I am tired of getting a skip limit when i don't want to listen to certain songs on my stations. Also Pandora is apparently not available to certain countries such as Ecuador. So when i was down there i couldn't even use the service or even cancel my service. Now back in the US i cancelled my subscription. Not dealing with it anymore after being a customer for a few years. Wish i cancelled it sooner. I have thousands of songs on my hard-drive just was lazy to deal with it.

Pandora,Buggy waste of advertising space,Amazon Customer,29-Nov-16,1,"Locks up over and over again if I'm even lucky enough for it to load and actually ""play music.""

Pandora,... on the the mood get it you wont be disappointed,p m santiago,26-Sep-16,5,Pandora affords me the opportunity to listen to just the type of music that i am in the mood for if i feel nostalgic i listen to the music of the 50s or boleros if i feel moody i listen to jazz it all depends on the the mood get it you wont be disappointed
Pandora,Not great.,Kindle Customer,21-Feb-14,2,"It is okay. If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit ""like"" it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."

Pandora,Pandora is still one of my favorite stations to listen to,Dominican Girl,12-Dec-15,5,Pandora is still one of my favorite stations to listen to. I just wish it didn't have so much ads.

If you don't like the chosen song, you must still listen to it.It may not be just what I wanted, but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can't hardly go wrong with this one. :P"

Pandora,Disappointing,kbw,10-Aug-13,1,"I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD. I enjoy classical music, and I set up a Mozart station.  It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?))  Then it played some Beethoven.  Then it played an ad.  Two pieces of music, and then an ad.  I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad.  I immediately removed it from my Kindle."
Pandora,"No, just no",Nikki,20-Feb-15,1,"Too many ads, you have to pay to get rid of them. They put albums in your radio station even though I only want 1 song.  It's a pain to set up specially since I already have my own music player with only so go I like.  :>p  I am deleting."
Pandora,Don't get this app.,Peter L.,6-Apr-14,1,"I deleted it after I downloaded it onto my phone.  When I agreed to ""permissions"" during the download it said I could change them in my settings after the download was completed.  This is not true.

It is next to impossible to find the artists I love.  Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia,  Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar.  It is useless to me.  I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria."

It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support.  After 5 minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone.  My kids love it; but my experience was awful.  iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I've never had a problem with it......guess I'll use that from now on."
Pandora,What a shame.,JamesonWilde,2-Sep-13,1,"I use this app all the time on my phone so I was excited to see it in the Amazon app store. I downloaded it, opened it at work, and... It worked great!

Would give five stars but the app simply doesn't work."
Pandora,Won't play on kindle fire,Kindle Customer,30-Dec-15,1,"Like many other recent reviewers said, the app doesn't work on kindle fire (or at least not on mine and theirs).

I absolutely love it and the selection of channels and variety of music they have available. I am giving this a four star rating because I do wish new music would become available a little bit more often other than every few weeks on the stations you select to listen to. If you are looking for a good music station, I highly recommend Pandora. My absolute favorite internet radio station of all time !"
Pandora,pandora,janet b gardner,30-Jan-14,5,what can I say it's the best yet I love the music I hear all the time reminds me when you could walk down the street with my transitter radio it's from my youth in the 60s love Motown. thank you very very much.
Pandora,variety,MyTruth101,14-Jun-14,2,Pandora definitely has much more variety than your average radio station. All I listen to is Pandora now but I come across the same songs all the time. It seems as though they play only the popular songs or have no k n owing of any different miles  you have been listening for hours. I sometimes Mark the thumbs down on some songs and somehow they still play in time . I just wish they could come up with more updated songs and add more than what they've been playing.
Pandora,Breaks often,Roger M,21-Sep-16,2,"Often need to uninstall, reinstall and losing all your favorites. When it works, very nice even with annoying commercials."
Pandora,Invasive permissions.,Quazar,2-May-16,2,I have been with Pandora from the  beginning but as of late things are getting bad.Fix permissions. Stop asking for location data. This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be ok but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it isn't fixed will swap to new app.If you have older versions dont updated.
Pandora,Best music product!,amanda,30-Jan-13,5,"Pandora is a creative and entertaining way to receive music from your favourite artists. You type In an artist and Pandora will play songs and artists that are similar to the artists genre. While you listen to music you may go online or play games at the same time. Pandora  allows you to skip a limited amount of tracks. You can only skip about 5 songs on that station. Although you may skip about five more tracks again after an hour. There is also ads between songs, but probably after every 5 or more songs. You can pay with an ad-free experience with Pandora for around $6.00. Another thing I like about Pandora is that if you see a song you like it will ask you if you want to buy it on iTunes or bookmark it. On Pandora you cannot replay a track or rewind it. I enjoy my experience with pandora and I think it is worth buying."
Pandora,Advertisements everywhere,Jessie,22-Jun-15,1,"This app is full of advertisements, even more than the website has. I was okay with the ads between songs but now the app plays video ads between songs too. There's also a ad in left hand corner so whenever I like or dislike a song I am hit with another ad. All the ads I get between every song has ruined this app for me."
Pandora,Have always loved Pandora,Deb,7-Dec-13,1,I've always loved Pandora but on my Kindle it won't open up other than showing me the blue green opening Pandora screen.  Really sucks cause I've been a loyal Pandora user for a long time.  Hopefully it gets fixed.
Pandora,This app doesn't work on kindle fire HD.,Key Eskelson,20-Oct-13,1,"I thought I'd download the app on my kindle fire HD just to see if all the reviews were true. They. Are. True. It's very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and doesn't change. I hope they fix the bugs! (I can't complain too much because the app was free, but it's still frustrating.)"
Pandora,Love it and hate it,Eric J.,31-Aug-13,3,"I love Pandora and am a paid subscriber.  However, every time I want to launch it I have to go into Apps and do a  shut down.  It doesn't always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature.  Then it will launch ok.  I talked to kindle support about this several weeks ago and they were able to reproduce the problem.  They said they would research and get back to me within five days but I'm still waiting.  I am getting ready to call them back."
Pandora,My Review,Isela Rios-Moreno,23-Feb-13,5,I just love Pandora - In the classroom I utilize their music to calm down my students....in my home I listen to my favorite type of music and so does my husband.....they really have a variety of music to choose from.....from the newest to the oldies....
Pandora,easy to use - huge music library,B E Campbell,17-Mar-15,5,We have Pandora streaming to our kindle and via a Roku to our TV.  The install on each device was easy.  We set up 1 station & enjoyed hours of music on it.  I like the variety on the menus of song titles - I'm anticipating being able to change collections of music easily & doubt that I'll get bored.
Pandora,_Ÿ˜¥_Ÿ˜¥_Ÿ˜¥_Ÿ˜¢_Ÿ˜¢_Ÿ˜¢_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ,Christin,31-Jan-15,1,I happen to be 11 years old and you need an email to use this... I don't have an email... there fore I claim this app to stink and is very unfair to other kids lacking the unneeded and stupid requirements this app needs just to play songs... why would you need an email to listen to a song..._Ÿ˜‘_Ÿ˜‘_Ÿ˜‘ not cool pandora... not cool....
Pandora,HORRIBLE KEEPS STALLING,Jaime cardenas,5-Aug-14,2,Im not that happy with Pandora right now i've been having problems with the application for some reason it just stalls and won't keep playing music i've never had this problem in the past but since it updated im guessing that something went wrong !!!
Pandora,Too much legaleeze,Cecilia,5-Jan-14,1,"To be honest, I dropped this before actually trying on my new tablet.  I've had a good experience using it on a friends tv quite a while ago, but the requirements from the company now...!  Unbelievable what they require."
Pandora,Good,Amazonoin 12,17-May-16,5,Good
Pandora,Three Stars,L. Scott Keinard,16-May-17,3,"unable to answer too many questions we have asked. hoping as time goes by, things will improve"
Pandora,Pandora! _Ÿ˜Å,Vladimir Calderon,5-May-16,4,"I love the Pandora app a lot, but it has so many glitches. Like one of them is that it won't let me delete my bookmarks. I tried to delete the app and reinstall it and see if that was the issue but it wasn't, please fix it! But other than that the design of the app is awesomes."
Pandora,needs work,c,21-Nov-12,3,"slow as balls sometimes to load new songs, have to restart a lot. seven more words are required there you go"
Pandora,Best radio media application available!,Angelczech,20-Dec-15,5,"I have had a Pandora One subscription for many years. Love the quality for the cost. I use it on my cell phone, laptop & notebook. I listen to my favorite stations during morning and evening commutes to and from work. Helps keep me sane. No loud annoying commercials anymore like on the radio. Hate the radio now and refuse to listen to it anymore since I've been listening to Pandora. I'm thoroughly spoiled and will never go back! My family is hooked too."
Pandora,no instructions,Cookie Dale,19-Apr-14,1,"I am not a young kid so I don't know how to use Pandora. I also don't see any instructions on how to use it. So in my opinion, I don't like it.  Can't use it until I see my nephew."
Pandora,good choice,S. Thomas,23-Jun-14,5,a great way to listen to music that you want to listen to.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to listen to music of their choice
Pandora,music for free,Holly,23-Feb-13,5,This is really great you get to listen to your favorite songs. if you don't like the song just put no and it will go to the next one. You can also do other things while you are listening to it. I am listening to it right now. I hope you like it
Pandora,could not get it to work,Silver2013,4-Feb-13,1,it kept wanting me to sign in and would not take my password and then they would ask for a new one and wouldn't take it.
Pandora,Beats Spotify radio,Chelsea,5-Jan-15,5,"Pandora is wonderful, you have to train your stations just a little at first, but once you do it's fabulous. Much better than Spotify's radio function which offers little variety. It's obvious how much time and care they put into the music genome project."
Pandora,I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS AND IT SHOWED UP AS A PURCHASE IN MY ACCOUNT,hbsmom,12-Jun-17,1,This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it.  I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password.
Pandora,I like Pandora but I will choose when to play it,Amazon Customer,29-Apr-16,1,Pandora tried to take over my phone.Every time I got out of an app. Pandora came on.I like Pandora but I will choose when to play it.
Pandora,Great music app.,Robert W. brockway,1-Jul-17,4,"A fine way to take music along as you go. I don't like the commercials, but the price is right."
Pandora,Goodbye,N,17-Aug-13,1,"I love this app on my smart phone so I decided to download it to my Kindle Fire HD. The app worked great at first but n ow when I try to listen to it, the app won't open. I'll stick to using Pandora on my phone until this version gets fixed. Too bad, cause it was nice while it lasted."
Pandora,doesn't work,lisabha,16-Nov-14,1,"This app is awful. It plays 1, maybe 1 1/2 songs then gets interrupted by a popup ad and the music stops playing. I love Pandora on my computer at work and even enjoy using it on my streaming devices and my phone, but for some reason it does not like working on my kindle. If I could give zero stars, I would."
Pandora,Best Music App out there,Lil' Cajun Girl,14-May-16,5,"I love my Pandora App.  I use it daily to listen to music.  I can never find anything good on the radio so I always turn to my Pandora App for my number one source of music.  It's super easy to use.  Just type in a band, artist, or song you like and Pandora will suggest different songs and Artists that sound similar to what you have chosen.  You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs that you don't like and Pandora won't play those any longer.  The more you rate and customize your stations the more Pandora will play only songs that you like.  It's perfect for me for when I'm listening to music in my car, at the gym, or just about anytime I want to hear music.  I have to say that this has got to be one of my favorite apps ever."
Pandora,Why Pandora,Kindle Customer,9-Jul-14,1,"When I first started Pandora I thought it was great, not once did it mess up. Then Today when they updated it it crashes sometimes, and my comments stopped working. I had to create a new account, my old account had 157 followers and I comment on any, songs, or people's pages. It was once 5 stars now it's 1. I still use it though"
Pandora,Does the Job,Amazon Customer,8-Oct-17,5,I need my music and music Pandora provides! Just wish the price for premium was lower.
Pandora,LOADED,Joseph N. Travaglini,30-Dec-12,2,"TALK ABOUT ADS AND COMMERCIALS! ATTEMPT CHANGING SONG OR ARTIST AND POP UP ADS SPROUT UP LIKE WEEDS AND COVER MOST OF THE SCREEN. YOU SPEND MORE TIME DELETING ADS THAN LISTENING TO MUSIC, ONLY TO FIND COMMERCIALS ON THE NETWORK. RATHER LISTEN TO MY OWN CD PLAYLISTS I CREATED."
Pandora,Can't open,Sarah,28-Mar-16,2,I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Pandora app on my Galaxy Note 4 TWICE in the last 3 weeks. I would like to note that I PAY $4.99 a month for Pandora...whatever glitch they have going on with this &#34;new and improved&#34; app needs to addressed PRONTO!
Pandora,"Say,,,,, WHAT?",Old Hippy in Iowa.,5-Apr-17,3,"Hmmm,????  I don't remember buying this. It must have come as a free app on my phone. Guess I'll have to check it out."
Pandora,too many ads on this app,bob bryan,2-Apr-14,1,"Too many ads getting in the way, good thing this was a free app.  I won't pay more to get rid of the ads"
Pandora,Failure after first song,A-Town,24-Apr-16,1,Been listening too and loving Pandora for nearly ten years. The app was going to be a dream come true but my kindle fire choked and vomited the app after one song. No sound and never-ending buffering. Fail indeed. Much disappoint.
Pandora,Fantastic!,reiyna,25-Jun-17,5,Controls are easy and they even give out tutorial!!! All of it is free too
Pandora,Pandora Passes with a Grade B+,Marie Neder,15-Oct-16,4,Pretty good BUT could use less commercials (not more which seems to be the case) and expand the library.
Pandora,Spotify is much better...,Amazonian,20-Feb-15,1,Get Spotify not Pandora.
Pandora,So repetive!,Loki,5-Jul-17,2,"It doesn't matter if I listen to a station for 3 hours or 20; I can thumbs up and down all day long and still it plays the same 20 songs by  the same10 artist. I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I'm so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it's the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. It's torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I'll just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about 10 stations I made, 5-10 others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I've tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every 3rd song. There used to be an ""add variety"" feature but I've had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I don't always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it's just a hassle."
Pandora,Doesn't work,ElizabethDD,16-Mar-16,1,"I had 2 stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs wouldn't play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that didn't work. Ridiculous."
Pandora,Pandora is My Favorite,Amazon Customer,18-Sep-16,5,"What's not to love about Pandora?  Free music of my choice, artists of my choice, and the option to shuffle music for hours on end.  Sure there are the occasional commercials, but they can easily be tuned out just like tv commercials.  I really wish I could get Pandora on my home stereo system, and also would like to get it in my vehicle, but I do not own a cell phone.  LOVE< LOVE Pandora"
Pandora,Lots of Listening,M. D. Brown,5-Jun-17,5,"So many artists, so many genres, so many stations, so much great music!!"
Pandora,FULL PAGE Ads the Instant You Join,modbantam,4-Nov-14,1,"Ads the Instant You Join is bat s***e crazy in terms of over the top, customer insulting, crack addict revenue-ing. Ad Mad is taught now in Marketing clearly. Jam it down customers' throats like feed to the goose for enlarged livers for pate. I wasn't on for 1 minute before the full page ads stopped everything. Smaller old school Ad Banners are dead? FULL PAGE INTERRUPTS are of the new expected toleration level? Not."
Pandora,Rock me baby,Barry Laskov,24-Jun-17,4,Pretty good. Lots competition. Does good job at recording my likes and customizing my stations
Pandora,Works great!,Erica I. Howe,19-Dec-12,5,"I use this app on my kindle daily, it is perfect because it allows the music to be heard in a large room. I love pandora!"
Pandora,Interrupts Music with advertisement,Donald Glenn Hatch,22-Dec-13,2,The free Pandora Kindle Fire app interrupts the music with advertisement. It also stops playing music and asks if you want to upgrade to a fee version - you have to answer and then tell it to go back to playing the music.  If you want some background music while working around the house this isn't a very good option.  I went back to playing Pandora on my Blue-ray player because it doesn't have as many interruptions.
Pandora,I can't live without Pandora!,Shelley,21-Oct-15,5,"I love my Pandora! I can stream the music I am in the mood for anytime, anywhere, on my desktop computer, any mobile device, and in my car using my aux cable to my phone, all commercial free. I can create stations by a favorite artist and all similar will play. I have discovered a few new artists this way that have become favorites as well!  I don't need CDs, Satellite radio, an MP3 player, or anything!"
Pandora,no longer works,binding_rose,22-Jun-16,1,This app used to work but now it will only play music for 1 second then stop completely. Please fix or update thank you
Pandora,Ok I guess...,Tamber Sheppard,7-Oct-15,3,I mean the app is great but if I could control what I listen to that would be great. I am a big fan of 1d and every time I go on 1d radio I get 5 seconds of summer. And I hate them I like Pandora but I like spotlight more! It lEts you pick the artist you want to listen to. Nothing against Pandora but sorry spot ivy is better. Better upgrade because spotify is bringing it up to a higher level than you!!
Pandora,Works on my IPhone but not on my Kindle Fire HD,Suzanne Toro,23-Jan-14,1,Whenever I sign in it says it's having technical difficulties. I've logged off of my account on my phone and then in again to check the password but it's still now working.
Pandora,also woul like more diversity in music,timothy sable,30-May-15,3,"i don't think i should have to pay for pandora one, also woul like more diversity in music, like on sirusxm, i am unable to subscribe to this doe to my bose soundtouch20, was not informed of this ehen i purchased this system.  be careful when buying this system as they told me i would be able to purchase this station. however i like pandora but i like a little more than what you get on the pop stations!"
Pandora,Great Music,very satisfied,5-Apr-13,5,I enjoy Pandora because I can listen to the type of music I like and I don;t have to keep changing the station I just put in the type of music I like and they just keep pulling up artist that play that kind of music
Pandora,Worthless,D. A. Hamer,2-Dec-13,1,"I can't log on to Pandora with this POS. ""We're experiencing unexpected technical errors."" I can get in with browsers but not with this thing. It's deleted from my Kindle."
Pandora,disappointed,Buster Walleye,25-Feb-15,1,"At first Pandora was great, I loved it, heard songs I haven't heard since I was young. After about a month of listening; one song would come on and then two commercials, after that nothing. I have to back out of the app and start over. Then the same problem would occur. Can somebody tell me why?"
Pandora,Three Stars,TLClady,13-Oct-17,3,When I switched to Premium I started having a lot of problems with the app.
Pandora,too bad.,Dakota,21-Apr-15,1,"Used to work. Now it won't load a single song on WiFi or LTE. I WAS a pandora one subscriber. No longer and never again will I pay for this terrible service. Also it plays the same songs OVER and OVER. I can't even reccomend the free app because it is so full of advertisements. Amazon music, spotify, Sony music unlimited, and Google's music service are all much better. Amazon music is probably the best."
Pandora,sucks,HELLO I am Lindsay Lohan!,10-Jun-13,2,"Pandora used to be really good, but lately, they have been making all these new rules and guidelines. It works well but it's hard to enjoy it because of these new rules. I do NOT recommend this to anyone!"
Pandora,Way too many comercials.,Honesty,9-Dec-13,1,"I don't mind a commercial a few times an hour, it almost like listening to radio - sometimes after 2 songs... I am sorry, but I'm never going to buy a Jeep or Lexus. I have switched to Jango and grooveshark. And deleted it off my devices. Also it is always on, you have to force close Pandora as well to completely turn off."
Pandora,Music,Smiley R.,23-Jan-13,5,"How can you go wrong with App, you have a choice of any music you want, and I absolutely love it!!"
Pandora,It stopped working :(!!,Austin,21-Nov-13,1,Before the newest update Pandora was doing just fine and know when ever I try to open it it ether crashes or it won't load any o  the songs. It just seas 00:00-00:00 and won't play the song and just sits there. I have tried un installing it and re installing it but nothing changed sadly. I was happy with the app until know.
Pandora,But love Pandora in general.,Dana 40,22-Jun-17,3,"Hadn't used it all that much, yet! When I did it quit twice during a song."
Pandora,Really like my Pandora.,Lynn C.,24-Jan-14,5,I was using the free Pandora with the ads and my husband told me about this.  I really like that I don't have to deal with advertisements while listening to my music.
Pandora,Had a great selection of you like new age,Louis M Bizzari,17-Jun-17,5,Has everything..  Had a great selection of you like new age.
Pandora,This sucks,Stone Michigan,9-May-15,1,"I have heard a lot of great things about Pandora, so I thought I would try it out. The only problem is, I can't try it out. This will not let me sign in to any e mail account. Please fix this Pandora."
Pandora,When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ...,Leo E. Niles,2-Mar-15,1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month.  All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they didn't get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up.  I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora.  Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I don't mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
Pandora,I love this app,courtney,20-Feb-16,5,I love this app. It is great. It has all the music you want to listen to. You can set your own listening preferences. You can skip a song if you don't like it and it won't be played on your track anymore after that. You can have several different listening channels so you can listen to what you are in the mood for without something out of the blue coming on.
Pandora,Great music,pollyjazz,28-Feb-13,5,"As always, Pandora is my choice of what I want to listen to in music. I am able to choose good Jazz, Big Band music which is almost impossible to find on ordinary music stations. Thanks for providing this choice."
Pandora,A Must Have App,Lloyd Jen,14-Mar-14,5,Maybe I'm a little basis since this is the first internet radio I have used. I have tried the others and always return to Pandora. The app is very easy to use and well polished. You can even continue to enjoy the music after leaving the app.Pandora now had an alarm that can wake you by playing your favorite stations. If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try.
Pandora,sloppy work,Katie Shaw,2-May-15,2,"When it is possible to log on it is FANTASTIC. However eight times out of ten, the app &#34;is having technical difficulties&#34; or won't recognize the correct log in information. There is no mechanism to inform Pandora either via the app nor on the direct web site. I even contacted Amazon about the issue and there has been no impact at all. I would give it five stars if I could get in."
Pandora,Won't work overseas,j.m.,23-Jan-14,2,"I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats."
Pandora,Worth it.,Debbie J Davis,12-Jun-17,5,I love it.  I no longer have to listen to music that I am not a fan of.
Pandora,Pandora stays on for approximately 5mins.,Shirley Cook,28-Mar-16,1,Pandora stays on for approximately 5mins . Device has to be turned off and on again and the same thing happens
Pandora,great music app for any device.,Floyd L. Jones,3-Apr-16,5,"I love that i can have this app on my computer and on each of my devises and it will sync with all of them so all of my music is right where i put it. Pandora allows you to listen to music for free, with commercials. I wish that i could choose what song i wanted to listen to but that is OK.  You are allowed so many song skips per hour of listening.  I love that there are multiple stations that i can choose from.  If you want to you can upgrade to Pandora monthly service for just 4.99 which isn't a bad price if you listen to it a lot and don't want the commercials and you want more skips. all in all this is a great app for music lovers"
Pandora,When I create my own stations with a variety of ...,Jeff Adams,27-Jan-15,3,"When I create my own stations with a variety of music styles, Pandora does not  shuffle the music well. That is to say I will  get several songs in a row of one variety, followed by several song in a row of another variety, rather than having them interspersedredseriescard@servivanhoeestates.link"
Pandora,Five Stars,LenÃ©,8-Jun-15,5,good
Pandora,Bad,sucks,15-Jun-14,1,"I dont loke this app, because in the very first moment i opened it. A message pooped up saying 'Your country is not supported' or some poop like that. Then why the duck cant i use it without all that country supporting crap? No matter in what country im i can find every song or artist. Duck this app."
Pandora,Music to your ears,Foxy Kindle Customer,22-May-17,5,Love this play it all the time I have many stations
Pandora,"Love the music, hate the lie... the lie wins",CabbyZ,14-Sep-13,1,"Seriously, I get 40 hours a month ""free""... A FARKING MONTH???Total BS IMO. No, there's no problem with the $3 monthly charge on the 'pay"" side of the house but calling your supremely limited 'ad supported' ""FREE"" makes Pandora the ""Free Credit Report.Com"" liars of the app set."
Pandora,Hated it,Kate Zulim,3-Dec-12,1,I downloaded iheart radio instead which is free too. Pandora is nothing but annoying ads in your face saying to buy a subscription to get this off blah blah blahDeleted it instead and got a better application.
Pandora,Love the ability to choose my own music,Blonde,22-Jan-13,4,"My husband has Sirius and even that cannot compete with  choosing your own favorites on Pandora. I could do without the ads, but I understand that is the ""price""  of no charge. Definitely recommend it."
Pandora,HATE IT!!!! :((((,C. Meadows,23-Sep-13,1,"to be honest, I don't even want to give this app one star!! Pandora used to be my favorite music app but now you only get a few hours to listen to music!!! Also if you use your 6 skips, its for every single station!! whenever I used my skips I would just go to another station and be fine.... now I cant!!! I thought an update was supposed to good, my review might say 1 star but I say ZERO"
Pandora,Accounts for me don't work because I can't remember the passwords also so many passwords require a specific way to create a pass,Bob,14-Mar-16,1,I don't completely have this app because I need to set up an account. Accounts for me don't work because I can't remember the passwords alsoso many passwords require a specific way to create a password like a upper case letter and a number in the password which really make s it too hard for me. This app is not worth it because of the creating an account for it.
Pandora,Issues navigating away from the app,rocky,8-May-15,2,"No lock screen controls anymore. When I navigate away from the app while songs are paused, such as using the phone or returning from the lock screen, it restarts the station does not continue playing the paused song. Very disruptive."
Pandora,Five Stars,Chris,18-Mar-17,5,use the app all the time
Pandora,My friends tell me Pandora is awesome.,Kindle Customer,3-Jan-14,3,I cannot get access to it because I get tangled up in all of the passwords needed to log in.Is anything being done about making electronic gadgets more user friendly in terms of access??There are passwords for everything!Can you take a picture of our eyes and use that for all log-ins?
Pandora,the good and bad,Mr O.,7-Sep-14,3,Good:Streaming all kinds of music on your device.Plenty of variety for all tastes.Bad:Free version will bombard you with data sucking ads.Ap is always running even when you are not using it.Can be a bit confusing to stop the ap from running.
Pandora,Not working ):,Jeslyn Lucia,31-Jul-13,1,It doesn't open the app at all! What can I do now? I need to get this up running on here.
Pandora,doesn't work on kindle fire hd,PrplPride28,30-Aug-13,2,I love listening to Pandora. I was hoping to be able to utilize the awesome speakers on the kindle fire hd but the application will not load. When an update comes out to fix the bugs I will change my rating to five stars
Pandora,Love Pandora,kay1054,8-Feb-13,5,I love being able to pick the artists that I want to listen to.  We have very few stations available and the music selection is undesirable so Pandora is a wonderful alternative to listening pleasure.
Pandora,There music is good but ALL LIVES MATTER,dadfisher,15-Jul-16,2,Because of there stand on black lives matter. I give them 2. They chose to go political and I counter with a 2 star they have no place to make a political statement. There music is good but ALL LIVES MATTER.
Pandora,Five Stars,Mishka,7-Jun-17,5,I love my Pandora....keeps me going on the go
Pandora,BEST IDEA EVER!!!,Barbers,8-Mar-13,5,"I used to listen to Pandora at work about five years ago and shortly started paying for it so i didn't have to listen to ads anymore.  I have never been happier with any other music source.  As long as you have internet, this is the way to go 100% of the time.  I listen to it at work, on my phone, in my car, my son has it on his Kindle Fire,  It is the best thing that ever happened to Music.  Not only can you choose the station you want and add whatever artist you want, you can tell it never to play a particular song again on that station by giving it a thumbs down.  If you spend hours tweeking it over years you end up with at least two or more different genre stations that have ONLY songs you like.  It also plays new songs that are similar to the artists you are listening to so that you can hear the new music coming out or artist you never heard of and never knew you loved.  The design is very simple and easy to use on whatever media player you are using.  It is just too great for words."
Pandora,Enjoyzble without having to select,Shoeless,9-Oct-17,4,"Enjoyable range of music - through affirmation of the tunes I want to hear, pandora algorithms do a good job of predicting what I want to hear without me having to think about it. I use the free service, so there are commercials though"

Pandora,angry,Paylea J. Wilder,5-Jul-17,5,This is a good app don't get wrong but with my kindle when ever I try to fix the password it isn't in my junk folder with the link _Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜™_Ÿ˜_
Pandora,Pandora review,kyra gayles,28-Dec-13,1,When I first started using Pandora there were NO advertising. Now there's nothing but advertising throughout the whole Pandora. I hate all those damn advertising. But I have to upgrade to Pandora 1& pay 3.99 per month to not get all the advertising. Well I guess I won't be using Pandora anymore.
Pandora,Not for the samsung tablet,Amanda,21-Dec-11,1,"I just bought a Samsung tablet and downloaded this, only to find that it doesn't work. It just sits on the blue screen that says Pandora and it doesn't have any menu options or ways to move past this screen. I uninstalled it and decided to live without it because I have enough music anyways... Disappointed!"
Pandora,I love it. I enjoy old music from the 60th,elena duplessis,3-May-17,5,"I  love  it.  I  enjoy  old  music  from  the  60th ,  70, 80, and  90.  They  are  beautiful  to  hear nowadays."
Pandora,Not a fan. It played for about an hour ...,Kindle Customer,15-Nov-14,1,"Not a fan.  It played for about an hour then stopped and just kept asking if I wanted to upgrade for $4.99/more. I could not get the message to go away.  Every time I tried to open the app, I got the upgrade message and could not get Pandora to play.  I deleted the app."
Pandora,Amazing with a problem.,Totdileman,8-Jun-13,4,This is a great app for music lover's! You can listen to the music while doing something else at the same time. The only bad thing is that you can only skip five songs a hour and adds come endless you by membership or whatever it is called
Pandora,Good for ambience,Libby S.,22-Jan-13,5,"I hosted a sewing party and used Pandora on my Kindle to give us some interesting background ""noise"". After 5 solid hours without pauses in service or repeated tracks, I'm a happy camper."
Pandora,pop up nuisance!,E. Edick,14-Feb-13,3,The free versions' adds (especially the pop ups) are very disruptive and worse than other services I'm aware of.I'm considering the paid version but checking other services more closely first.
Pandora,just fine. ad's are annoying but don't interfere with listening,Superlead777,8-Jul-15,4,just fine.ad's are annoying but don't interfere with listening.

Pandora,Music box dancer,darkwind,14-Jul-16,5,It can't get any better than Pandora Music you can pick the songs you like bestOther than songs you don't want to hear thumbs up for Pandora!!!!
Pandora,Five Stars,Elmira R. Frieson,2-Mar-17,5,So needed keeping my high on tunes
Pandora,Pandora,Florence Parrish,25-Jan-13,3,"I don't understand how it works.  I can choose an artist and after one song it switches to another artist.  Also, it shuts off in the middle of the next song. Pandora George Jones or Tom Jones"
Pandora,For Music Lovers,Cheryl J. Mahoney,4-Jan-14,5,"I've actually had Pandora for years.  It's the place I can go to when I want to listen to the music I like to hear (gospel).  I can choose who and what I like and Pandora will add the same type of music to my choices; if I like it I can keep it, and if not I can just give it a thumbs down and I won't have to hear it anymore.  I happen to like my Pandora commercial-free, so I pay a small yearly fee for that luxury, but if you don't mind the commercials, you don't have to pay anything to enjoy your kind of music."
Pandora,Incessant ads,Igor,2-Jun-17,1,Incessant and loud ads. You cannot stop or pause an ad. Horrible!
Pandora,Good App,Robert L. Strickler,17-Apr-17,5,I have installed but do not use.
Pandora,it worked for a while,R.E,11-Nov-13,1,When I first signed up for Pandora it was just fine.  I was rating songs and artists listening to the music.  About a week later I tapped on the Pandora icon and it didn't respond.  I downloaded Pandora but I keep getting the error message saying that they are having technical difficulties.
Pandora,Five Stars,Robert  Ferguson,3-Oct-17,5,Good
Pandora,I don'; t even know why this is showing ...,Chris T.,17-Mar-17,1,I don';t even know why this is showing up for me to comment.  I never purchased it
Pandora,Why did I wait??,iRod,28-May-14,5,"Having known about Pandora since it's inception I am wondering now why I waited so long to install it on my phone. It is absolutely a wonderful way to listen to your favorites but, more importantly, discover some new ones."
Pandora,bad radio,Sage Langhus,13-Jan-13,1,Friday time after I registered Pandora It rejected my email and password. After  a lot of times 're-downloading .It still didn't work. So please don't get the app . I know it is a popular choice of radio like apps.
Pandora,Much better apps on the Internet,Chris Ramsay,31-Aug-16,1,I do not like this app. There are a lot better out on the market. I prefer Apple Music. Just my preference. Too many commercials and slow to load. Use a different one app is my suggestion.
Pandora,"peaceful, relaxing music",Frank  E. Gilbert,5-Nov-16,5,Love Pandora music...
Pandora,awesome,naomi,6-Jan-14,5,I think this app is really great especially on kindle cause you can't download music. I really think we should have more apps like this!!!
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,21-May-17,5,Really enjoy music to a new level.
Pandora,Five Stars,James,13-Jun-17,5,Excellent product works great
Pandora,Problem might be my Kindle,Robert C. Koche,12-Nov-15,1,"I can't figure out if the problem is Pandora or my Kindle Fire as the sound plays occasionally and never when I want.  Pandora runs great on my Android phone, Mac and Windows PC so this is quite disappointing."
Pandora,Two Stars,Emma Strano,26-Aug-17,2,who needs this...not me !!!!
Pandora,I wish I could older version back,Red,3-Dec-12,1,This newer version of pandora sucks. All it does is keeps playing song that I tell it no to. And it also keeps dorping out. It is terrible. Wish I had never updateed the older one that I had.
Pandora,Wonderful app.,FSUWolverine,22-Jan-13,5,This is an awesome app.  I enjoy my own music all day at work and can change it up a bit when I want to.  I would highly recommend this app.  Pandora is awesome.  Have in my truck also.
Pandora,Five Stars,songolocks,26-May-17,5,love it listen all the time
Pandora,Great app but it has flaws,Imilie Pual,23-Feb-13,3,I love Pandora but whenever I wanna listen to a song it never plays the song. It would be better if I could skip more than 6 song every hour on 1 station. Other than that it's good
Pandora,Still Robbing My Credit Card?,Eliz Staeheli,9-Mar-16,1,"Okay, so I wanted Pandora paid for a while, but discovered that it really wasn't worth $60 a year for me and discontinued. Imagine my dismay to find months later a charge feom Pandora. What's going on here?"
Pandora,Too many ads everywhere!,Hooman,11-Nov-15,2,"Good idea, good app, decent music BUT:1. You can't pick EXACTLY what artist or song you want to listen to. You pick the genre and HOPE it comes on...2. There are annoying ads all over the place...not only in the bottom but you also have to skip to none skippable ads too.3. You can't skip songs more than 6 times per stations."
Pandora,No kindle support.,Jeffrey Smart,29-Apr-17,1,doesn't work on kindle fire
Pandora,New music,michael thomas,17-Aug-17,4,Use it to look for what is new
Pandora,Not a good app.,Kristi,14-Dec-12,1,"The app constantly stops playing music. It will play a few songs and stop, usually when an ad pops up. You can purchase the ad free app though, but I haven't so not sure how well that works. I have talked to several others and they have had this same problem with the Pandora app. Not enjoyable"
Pandora,Five Stars,HP,28-Jul-16,5,Love this app I use it all the time
Pandora,hard to set,ken d,2-May-16,1,could not figure it out to use the right way
Pandora,One Star,Sean McLaughlin,19-Apr-17,1,Sounds like...it doesn't work.
Pandora,"WHERE THE @%$# DID THIS THING COME FROM, ANYWAY?",William W. Carrigan,19-Apr-16,1,"In the first place, I NEVER ordered this app.  I have no idea why it shows as being ordered by me, because I never do social media.  The only redeeming thing about this whole episode is that it didn't cost me anything.  I guess I'm going to have to find out who has hacked my account, and take whatever violent action may be necessary."
Pandora,access on kindle fire,Karen Ramirez,28-Jul-16,2,Only problem is I cannot access on my kindle fire
Pandora,Worst app ever!,Kim,6-Aug-15,1,I loved this app at first but now I HATE it I was just wanting to listen to music so I went on it and it started skipping song and then I shut my kindle all the way off and I turned it on again and it said &#34;Were sorry but we have no more music for you try turning to another station.&#34; So I did and it said the same thing please fix!
Pandora,Won't open,Eliza Lorme,21-Aug-13,1,"After looking at all the good reviews for this app, I decided to get it. Unfortunately, it wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire HD. It just stayed on the blue Pandora screen. Any way to fix this and I will buy it again."
Pandora,Pandora doesn't work,Megan  Stover,19-Nov-13,1,I have herd that you can listen to any music on this app but mine wont work for me. I have a kindle and an iPod and on both it wont work. On my kindle fire it worked but when i wanted to change the song my whole kindle crashed. On my iPod i cant create or log in to my account.
Pandora,"half music, half silence",Shyah Miller,18-Feb-15,4,"It will play a song of two, then go quiet for five to ten minutes. Then it will play a commercial, then start over again. It's very agitating. I tried to contract Pandora to fix the problem and never got a response. I've uninstalled it, the reinstalled it; it didn't work."
Pandora,changed permissions,Jen,12-Apr-13,1,So Pandora did an update and they can now access my contacts and send them emails without my permission. I loved Pandora but I will not risk them sending stuff to my many contacts especially since a lot if them are professional contacts. Goodbye Pandora. Looking for something else now.
Pandora,If you love music... Pandora is great,Judi Bruck,2-Mar-13,5,"I love using Pandora.  It is easy to set up.  It is easy to customize.  The more you use it... the thumbs up/thumbs down, skip... the better it makes your music selections."
Pandora,Not worth the hassel,s. smith,10-Aug-13,1,This could be a good app but when you buy the add free version; anything but add free.  Contacted customer support and they can't fix it.  Bought this once just to cancel due to all the adds.  Bought again to see if fixed and nope.  Adds galore.  Just stick with the free version.
Pandora,Fix this!!,Dylan Magic,5-Dec-15,1,"There is a major issue causing the tracks to skip through the entire song in a matter of seconds.  A song will start, and it'll jitter thirty seconds ahead every second until the song &#34;ends&#34; and it'll continue with the issue through every song that follows.  I don't know the cause of this, but I hope someone fixes this."
Pandora,Pandora = Awesome,Howsthisname,9-Feb-14,1,"Pandora must be in the habit of spoofing reviews of itself. I never signed up for this, never created an acount, have never and will never, ever use it, and do not wish to be included with anyone who thinks Pandora is anything worth having.I am ready to sever all ties with Amazon if Pandora comes along with it. BUYER BEWARE,!!"
Pandora,Pandora is awesome. I love it,Randall S.,3-Jan-17,5,Pandora is awesome. I love it. Even better is the fact it doesn't eat battery up on my cellphone.
Pandora,Wouldn't sign on and work Don't know if it's Pandora ...,Lady L,24-Jun-17,1,Wouldn't sign on and work  Don't know if it's Pandora or my Kindle Fire.

Pandora,Fix the Update,Nana of 7,30-Aug-13,1,"This was my favorite app until the latest update. Now it won't even start on my Kindle and if it does, it locks up after just a few songs or if I change the channel.  I am a paying customer and deserve to have what I pay for.  Can't even figure out how to stop my subscription."
Pandora,"Very good, BUT",Workstead,2-Mar-14,3,"Pretty good music selection as others have noted. My concerns are operational controls that are weak or lacking on my Nexus 7.1 Android tablet.When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back. The big reason I miss the sleep timer is because when I am drowsey and want to turn Pandora off I have to almost wake up because of no quick way to shut  Pandora off. It requires a bunch of taps to turn off. Where oh where is my sleep timer for my android tablet????"
Pandora,Five Stars,Doris Mitchell,18-Sep-17,5,Great music app
Pandora,Thanks Pandora!,Amazon Customer,26-Apr-17,5,"I love Pandora sometimes it plays some of my fav songs and new songs that I like!it even helps me relax or go to sleep!I love Pandora.Creators of Pandora,if you see my comment thank you thank you thank you so so much!I think EVERYONE that loves music should have this ad.also Pandora take out the bad words music.Thx!"

Pandora,Five Stars,Jackie Rizo,29-Mar-16,5,Love it
Pandora,glitchy at times.,Adam,22-Oct-13,3,"True. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I'm using a kindle fire hd. When it does work it's great and performs top notch. When it doesn't it sits at the intro screen and when you try to 're open it, it flashes and closes. Is this a bug? If yes, then needs an update."
Pandora,Good product!,paul ene,20-Mar-17,5,Good  product!
Pandora,Love!,sdryals,18-Mar-17,5,Love Pandora!
Pandora,Poor reception,Linda Lanteigne Magoon,20-Jun-13,1,"I live in New Hampshire and the reception is spotty, at best. The songs are constantly breaking up. Not the top notch service I thought it would be. In addition, when the app needs to be upgraded, it requests that I register again and select a different user name and password."
Pandora,GREAT APP AND EXCELLENT SOUND,Terry L Adams,1-Dec-12,5,"I have listened to Pandora for the past few years and love it. Installing it on my Kindle Fire 2 and being able to listen to music in the background while using the Kindle for the web and other features is right up my alley. Also, I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound. It's great for this device. Highly recommend."
Pandora,One Star,Kanders,6-Mar-17,1,sucks
Pandora,Great sound from my Kindle.,Onyx joy,31-Jul-15,5,"I have not use it to much yet but when I have I have enjoyed the music. I'm able to bring up the music I want quickly and easily. I really like the quality of the sound of the music, a lot of the time my Kindle is too soft . I have to use earbuds or a plug in speaker to hear U Tube and some other music I've downloaded. Pandora plays nice and loud .enough through the Kindle. I do hate having to use a password to sign in, it's on MY Kindle which is open I don't see the need of a password."
Pandora,Does not work,CS Vincent,28-Dec-15,1,"New Fire HD, latest op-sys upgrades, loaded Pandora App.  It recognizes my account, loads my stations, but will not play.  It will advance to next song, change stations, everything except play.  Nice."
Pandora,Ads ads ads,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-16,2,"Too many ads, ads are too long, and I wish I had the ability to opt out of live performances. Hearing people scream ""WOOO"" the entire song isn't exactly pleasurable."
Pandora,"Get's the job done, but there are better options",Amazon Customer,21-Mar-17,3,"The app itself is ok, but Pandora is getting a little long in the tooth. The constant commercials, the extremely lacking selection, and constant repeats are getting annoying. Back in the day I used Pandora to find new bands, but lately they've been getting stagnant (and redundant). It seems they're going for ""hits"" instead of music that doesn't get played on the Top40. I've moved on to Spotify for the most part, but once in a while will come back to see if they've added anything I like. However, even after a few hours it's still the same songs (not just bands) that played the last time I listened to it. There's hardly any variety with songs and/or bands anymore.Maybe this is a side effect of using the free (or mobile) version; or maybe they just have a very limited selection for specific bands, but it doesn't compel me to buy into it; there's plenty of other options."
Pandora,Too many commercials,Amazon Customer,17-Dec-12,4,"Yes, I know, that's how they pay for things. But come on, commercials every third song or so? Wow. I remember using Pandora years ago on my computer - it wasn't that bad."
Pandora,Three Stars,TN Transplant,12-Oct-17,3,It's okay
Pandora,far to many commercials,charles hackley,6-Jan-17,1,used to pay liked it a lot. money got tight drop it to free WOW so many commercials. was gifted a fire tablet get amazon free music NO commercials love!!!
Pandora,Pandora Rocks.,Shanna Wu,22-Dec-13,5,Works wonderfully. I love choosing my music styles. I'm playing R&B and Pop holiday music at work.  I have cancelled XM.
Pandora,doesn't stay on,Lisa Brandt,21-Jan-14,1,After one song it stops playing. This is very annoying when I'm doing my hair or anything else were I have to walk away from my kindle. Even after I change my awake time to 15 minutes it still stops after one song until I unlock my kindle. Please get this fixed
Pandora,stopped working when screen goes away,Jennifer,3-Jan-14,2,"I tried playing music with this app, using my Pandora One acct. As soon as the screen goes black the app stooped working.... so I have to the screen active I order to listen to my music? I can listen to it on my phone and it doesn't do that. Very disappointed."
Pandora,SUDDENLY ISNT WORKING,Dana,3-Mar-16,1,For the past 3 days the app will open but the music won't play and I can't  do anything like try to pause and unpause it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still won't work! What can you do about this? The bar at the bottom that says how long the song lasts and how much of it has played just says 00:00 out of 00:00
Pandora,eh..,ryanlindsey,25-May-13,3,it used to be better when you didn't have a certain ammount of time a month to listen. you only get forty free hours. its not the best any more :/ disappointing.
Pandora,Great app - listen to it all the time.,Amazon Customer,19-Dec-12,5,"I really like this app.  I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money.  I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home.  At home, I connect to a bluetooth speaker.  When a call comes in, the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again.  Unlimited music selection."
Pandora,Not happy with new version,WidowBeth (Laurel),12-Dec-16,1,I am getting tired of the newest version opening up no matter what I don't want.  I exited out of it 5 x yesterday. After I quit.  I may have to delete.
Pandora,Five Stars,Tshais2014,24-Oct-14,5,great buy will buy again if needed
Pandora,Just a few things.,Kindle Customer,14-Sep-15,2,"I would really love more skips. So would all of my friends.Less adds of course,the usual complaint.A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like.I would really like to be Abel to make a collection of songs to just put on repeat. If there is one pls tell me. I've looked everywhere."
Pandora,Why you are in politics?,Amazon Customer,25-Jun-16,3,The reason that I am not giving five stars is that Pandora is restricted to some people in some other countrys.This is a music Media not a political establishemnt.
Pandora,awesome classic rock,Gypsy,23-Feb-13,5,Was sent an intro by my Sister. Signed up for free trial. Awesome tracks. Brings back the old days.May consider the monthly subscription somtime in the future.
Pandora,not good,TIM COLLINSWORTH,3-Dec-13,1,"Would not work, removed it from my device. Found another app covering blues and jazz which is 80% of what I listen to."
Pandora,It used to be nice when it was 30 dollars for a year of ...,John L.,5-May-16,2,"It used to be nice when it was 30 dollars for a year of premium. But now a price increase,  more ads and commercials with the basic make this not worth loading at all."
Pandora,Great selection of music,linuspoon,4-Sep-14,4,"There is a great selection of music. Only bad thing about it is there is no way to like or dislike a song when the phone is in locked mode.  If there is a way to like/dislike a song while phone is in locked mode, then it will be superb."
Pandora,love it,JenniferC.,6-Sep-15,5,I love it you get free music but there's only one thing i hate you need Wi-Fi it drives me crazy because at my house we dont got Wi-Fi but on the way to school i use the Wi-Fi my bus driver has but any way great app it has all the music u ask for get it its great
Pandora,Pandora Fan,Mary Allen,8-Feb-13,5,I love the variety of music and I am really enjoying all of it from motown to relaxation music!!!I average listening to  Pandora about 4 hours a day.
Pandora,Five Stars,TCCM,24-Jun-17,5,Works well

Pandora,I love Pandora.,Amazon Customer,18-Jan-17,5,"I love Pandora...use it on computer at home and work....as well as my phone.  It is the best.  I am always at my ""100"" stations allowed because with just a couple of exceptions, I like all music from the 1940's - present.  LOVE IT"
Pandora,Great App!!!,App_critic,14-Jun-14,5,"Collect app!You get to pick your own radio station based on what you listen to,listen to music related to what your radio station is about,and just jam to the music all day!!=) =)I would definitely approve this app for 5 stars!! :) :) =) =)"
Pandora,Can't log in,Vlad Wielbut,26-Mar-14,1,"On my Kindle Fire when I try to log in, the app tells me, ""We are experiencing unexpected technical difficulties."" I believed it the first time but it's been two weeks and I still get this error. That is not unexpected any more, is it?"
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,6-Jun-17,5,great
Pandora,"Latest update, conflict with Kindle Fire HD",Mike F.,6-Jan-14,3,"The addition of an alarm clock is a nice feature, but it's not working on my locked device. I woke up and discovered the screensaver on and burning up the battery, but no music until I entered my password. Maybe there is a workaround? Hopefully would not require yet another Android permission. How much personal data do you guys need to collect? I'm sure ad revenue and paid versions generate considerable profit. We know the musicians are not being compensated appropriately. As far as the app's overall consistency I will say that things run smooth and it is enjoyable to hear mainstream &#34;radio&#34; hits from time to time. One thing I liked about the old Yahoo Music Jukebox (an earlier platform of audio streaming Pandora seems to have modeled itself on) was having the opportunity to hear much deeper tracks from artists I never knew about."
Pandora,pretty good app,Andrewsky,6-Sep-14,4,good for listening to music
Pandora,What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ...,Lawrence M Earley,26-Jul-16,5,"What could be better? You can have it on multiple devices where ever you go. My favorite thing about it is that if you enter a statement nag or group, it can introduce you to new music."
Pandora,Free Music,Skipster,17-Apr-13,5,"This app used to be better , meaning more music less ads but after a revamp has now more ads than you care for but still come back time and time again for . The selection of available artists and other tuning / set up features with in PANDORA are amazing and what truly makes it a lil' better than most of it's competitors ."
Pandora,Pandora is awesome,Kathy  Hendrix,12-Feb-13,5,Pandora  is one of the best apps I have.On Pandora you can choose you favorite artists or song plus  and other artists  and other song's related to it.
Pandora,Four Stars,Jim Tucker,17-Aug-17,4,Good
Pandora,ads!!!???,Tennisgurlie,2-Jun-16,2,"So many ads, so little music. Also, the ad is displayed and in your way all the time. I thought about paying for the service but the price jumped up way too high."
Pandora,Pandora,Dorothy McGrath,20-Jan-13,5,Great program.  So easy to use and no download time.  I can get almost any music I desire and have the music playing in the background while I'm working.
Pandora,lots of fun,joe burns,31-Aug-13,5,"this definitely has every song on it that you can possibly think of... except for dave chappell which sucks. i listen to it all day at work, but be prepared for it to almost immediately drain the battery of any device that you are using to listen to it."
Pandora,Bought but,Nevadder,6-Feb-13,1,I purchased this app so I could listen to free music. But I can't find it or figure out how to download it.  Reply.  Ok. Your tech guy helped. Thanks.
Pandora,umm no!,Delandra,8-Jan-13,1,I couldnt even install this app to my kindle... perhaps it isnt for the kindle but for a phone because everytime it begins to install my kindle cuts on and off until finally my battery is dead! Now i cant even turn it on i am SEVERELY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS!!!

Pandora,Pandora is the best music app.,Brandon Dobbs,28-Sep-16,5,This is the most convenient and easiest interface music app out there. There is a reason this app is at top of the app store
Pandora,Fantastic!,Kenneth Banks,19-Apr-14,5,Without equal!  It would take days to put together the great selection that Pandora does. It's difficult to stop once you start listening with hit after hit that's keep rolling on. The best and most enjoyable app I've downloaded by far!
Pandora,Won't run on Android tablet & Annoying Ads.,Steve Coakley,13-Nov-12,2,When I try to install this app on a tablet it fails saying I already own the app but I don't since it won't install! It works OK on a Mini PC TV stick but they have really annoying ads about gun background checks you can't skip though. Best to skip this app.
Pandora,pandora media,angel cordova,8-Feb-13,5,Love this Pandora Media it is great  It has all the old school sounds that I enjoy.  Everyone needs to listen to your favorite tunes with Pandora.
Pandora,Great music at your fingertips. Check out Pandora.,Steve Pearson,23-Jan-16,5,"I love Pandora. It works very well on my Motorola DROID phone. It works somewhat less well in my Volvo car in that there is a long delay before the first track plays and a rather lengthy delay between each subsequent track. Also, often, Pandora in the Volvo will repeat tracks which is very annoying. But, I love being able to access my favorite styles of music for free and stream them for hours on end. I also like how I am able to listen to different takes by artists than those that are generally played on the radio. And, there are a number of live tracks that are played. It's all good stuff!"
Pandora,BLAHHHHHHHZAY! C GRADE!,Patti Harris,11-Oct-15,1,"Terrible selections - very limited, unless you only follow easy listening or mainstream for the masses. Classical very limited. I searched ? Madrigals and Renaissance and Early music and came up with rock bands with those words in their names. Just mass junk, really and won't recommend to a music connisseur."
Pandora,I listen to Pandora on our smart TV and love it,SR989ER,26-Jul-16,3,"I listen to Pandora on our smart TV and love it.  I assumed I would like heaing music on my computer as well but I found the music distracts me for my activity.  That's why I only gave it three stars.  For a lot of people, this would not be  problem and in that case it deserves five stars."

Pandora,Great Padio Service,Richard Spensley,5-Feb-13,5,"I really like his service.  I have three differnt statons programmed.  You have to fool with it a bit to get the individual statons playing your requested format, but they give Artist info and usually a list of ""like"" artists which you can add as ""seeds"".After a while, your ""station"" will be playing, pretty much, the genre  you desire, along with a bunch of additions you forgot, didn't think  of, or never heard of.Be patient!It'll come around.You can ""Thumbs down"" selections you don't want.I love it!One caveat . . . it is not""gender"" selective.Keep at it for a while, and you will be pleased."
Pandora,Five Stars,sexy,21-Jul-17,5,Great site
Pandora,Works Well On Fire Devices,Ted Harden,12-Dec-16,5,"I've had and used Pandora for many years and just downloaded it to my Fire device, so there is not a whole lot I can say about the program itself. It works as it does on all my other devices and I am very happy with it. I also use other comparable streaming music programs, and Pandora works was well as they do."
Pandora,Didn't deliver.,Gordon Armstrong,27-Nov-12,1,The free version of this software did not deliver what was promised. I could not get it to to play music at all. Could not evaluate if it was really worth buying or not!
Pandora,Can listen to music I like,podnurse,16-Mar-13,5,I really like having the music I LIKE over and over again and can enjoy it while doing other tasks or reading on my kindle.  Great product especially for being free!!
Pandora,time out,Gregory G,19-Feb-14,1,My Pandora app has been in session time out for 3 days. Good thing the app was free. I asked for help but those who can help must also be on time out.
Pandora,PANDORA,William,24-Nov-12,3,"Being the old guy I am, I could never quite figure out what this was and what to do with it. If I knew more about these type things, it may actually be a great program."
Pandora,Sounds good,garry,19-Dec-12,3,"Like the sound quality..Too bad you can't download the songs or repeat the songs you like, but it puts together some amazing playlists. 5 stars for the price and sound quality, but minus 2 stars for the reasons mention."
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,14-Aug-16,4,"I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will be as expected."

Pandora,I'm in the Mood,Gail Bailey,30-Oct-13,5,I love that I can listen to my music.  Whatever mood I am in at the time.  Where ever I am at any given time I have access to the music that comforts me.
Pandora,Needs Updates,nate to,6-Sep-13,2,"This is a great app in terms of the vast amount of great music of all types, although it lacks regular updates that come on iOS. If this app would regularly update I would not even be writing this review. The old version of this software (the version that is being used on Amazon) is not a perfect answer for your music, but it is as good as it gets. Amazon charges a seller fee for every sale and I believe that is the reason that Pandora does not give regular updates on kindle; they can get such a greater profit on iTunes and Google store. It is not Pandora that is doing a bad job; it is Amazon that is not allowing its customers to get regular! updates just for the small effects amount of money they get from it. Come on Amazon"
Pandora,HORRIBLE,Hielly,18-Aug-13,2,On the kindle fire it . Will not load and/or takes a long time to load. I do not recommend this app for kindle fire users... good for an iPod or iPad though
Pandora,Inflexible,Beammeupscotty,18-Oct-13,1,I found the inability to skip unwanted tracks simply unacceptable.  Program was deleted.  Amazon says I didn't use enough words so I added this sentence.
Pandora,Pandora is a very neat and free streaming music service.,C. Knight,16-Dec-16,5,I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system. I like the ability to enter the specific artist whose style of music you prefer and find artists few people have even heard of. I have the free service with few commercials that really do not bother me as they as so short.
Pandora,"Play the entire price of music instead of cutting off, I paid for no commercials, is that cost too?",Linda Franklin,11-Jun-16,3,"I like Pandora, I even paid extra not to get the commercials, but why does the music cut off before it is not finished.

Pandora,great,Sarah6942,24-Jan-14,5,The only issue I am having with this app is that it went from being able to skip six songs per hour to know is like teen for all the station's in one so I might have to delete the app cause I liked six per station
Pandora,was great but not so much anymore,dactyl,2-Sep-13,2,"The app is great sometimes, but for the majority it just freezes on the opening screen and is more or less useless now.

Pandora,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service",Bkwmn2,21-Oct-15,3,"I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
Pandora,Skip Pandora.  You want SPOTIFY!,Mariem Scott,31-Jan-16,1,"Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app.  And for a while, it met all my needs.  However, there is a better player in town now and his name isÂ Spotify Music.  If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice.  But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you wantÂ Spotify MusicÂ .If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:PANDORA1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $4.99/month.3. Library size - 1 million+ songs.4. Can user pick song? NO.5. Can user skip songs? Yes.  But with limitations.  6 skips per hour, per station. No more than 30 skips in 24 hours.SPOTIFY1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $1 for 3 month trial.  Individual membership $9.99/month and each added family member gets 50% discount.3. Library size - 30 million songs!4. Can user pick song? YES!.5. Can user skip songs? YES!  NO LIMITS! :)"

Pandora,Pandora totally lets me customize my music...,Kindle Customer,7-Feb-13,5,"Pandora is amazing.  My daughter listens to Christian music, and Pandora is so totally customizable that I tend to think of Pandora as a Christian radio station.  **It is anything but a Christian radio station, since you can listen to *anything* else - one friend of mine has a classic rock station.**  You can make it into anything you want.The commercials don't bother me at all.  So far there've only been decent ads (regular TV spots) and I think that this is one of the electronic products that you can ""opt out"" of the ad after so many seconds into the ad.  Some of the ads are good (that is, interesting, at least to me).Great product.  I can't recommend it highly enough."

However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music (which was the reason I bought the item).  There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists.  When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song.  The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good.  I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."

Now that I've downloaded it to my tablet and galaxy s5, I am constantly listening to my stations. The Music Genome Project and it's results never cease to impress and amaze me. I am able to steer a station in the right direction and then Pandora turns it into an ideal station suited to my likes. Great app!"

I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't.  I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you're about to lose a customer, if you don't get it together."

Pandora,I just love the music selection,Sunny Gal,23-Nov-15,5,"I paid the annual fee so I don't have the pesky commercials.  I just love the music selection.  The only thing I don't like is when I choose a song from a performer as a ""radio"" the song doesn't play.  I have to wait for it to eventually come up.  For instance I really, really wanted to hear ""Over the Rainbow"" by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my ""radio.""  Another song played and I never could get Over the Rainbow.  Other than that, I love Pandora and love the ease that I can add it to my car, my tablets, phone, etc.  Very user friendly."

Pandora,Intermittent Functionality Kills 5 Star Review,J. E. Helms,7-Mar-16,4,This would be an excellent app except for the fact that every other time I start it or it gets an update it stops playing any music at all. Song titles and info appear for the expected duration of the track but no sound is played and there isn't even an animation to indicate that something might be trying to play. When the next update arrives it functions normally again. Until the next time. Very frustrating.

Pandora,Too ad heavy,William C. Bullock,22-May-13,1,Pandora is too add heavy for me.  The ad format is obnoxious with large pop ups in the middle of the screen which are not easily closed.  The in app purchase to get rid of most of the ads is problematic.  This spoiled an otherwise good app.
Pandora,Music is great,ls,22-Feb-13,5,"My son downloaded this for me.  I had heard about Pandora but didn't know how great it was.  Yes, there are a few commercials but not too many to make you want to pay for the no commercial service.  Music is great and so many choices!"

Pandora,Pandora great but not on Kindle Fire,Frank P. Mora,12-Feb-13,1,"Pandora One on Kindle Fire frustrates. You cannot use Pandora without being nagged to upgrade to One. When you follow the link you cannot go to the Pandora web site even though the option is presented. You must go to the Amazon store which is frustrating in itself. At the Amazon store, you have to search for Pandora One and it then only finds Pandora. If you ever do get to Pandora One in the Amazon store it will not download or install. Pandora is great. Amazon Store is frustrating and I hesitate to use it"

Pandora,No.,Casey,9-Aug-16,1,"This app is very confusing. I cant make playlists of one song, instead i have to listen to WHOLE ALBUMS. Another problem is when im listening to my favorite band, it switches to a different band for me that i probably dont want to listen to. And on top of that is the CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENTS. I know that advertising is in all apps but i DONT WANT AN ADD AFTER EVERY SINGLE SONG. Overall, one star pandora, im switching to spotify."

Pandora,IT STINKS!!!,Wounded Warrior,9-Oct-13,1,"I thought this app looked good until I downloaded it. It doesn't even open! It just stays on a blue screen with Pandora in the center. I literally waited about half an hour for it to open. Nothing happens. Just saying I got it for the Kindle Fire HD.Don't download it. It's not worth it. (unless you like looking at blue screens, of course)  -.-"
Pandora,It never loaded unto my Kindle FIre,Karen T.,20-Jan-13,1,Cannot open it - it seems it did not load.  I would appreciate knowing what I am doing wrong in getting these apps.
Pandora,Love Pandora,The Moose,27-Dec-14,5,"I have to admit when I was first introduced to Pandora I was rather skeptical. However without a doubt it has become my go to app for music. To be able to build music lists from categories, names, styles, genres, or even song titles is just plain awesome. Even though you can't pick the songs that are played on your list you can help it evolve by giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings. I realize that since Pandora has come out there is newer and more sophisticated music apps coming out but so far I keep coming back to Pandora. Personally I subscribe to Pandora One which has been $36 per year and allows you to listen to music non-stop without commercial interruption. Highly recommended."
Pandora,Don not buy,HKinkel,25-Jun-16,1,This sucks can't find any good music every thing sucks fix it know add.all iTunes music it has better

Pandora,PANDORA,John Stewart,24-Nov-12,4,"Cool app, fairly easy to use. Can sometimes play the same artists a bit to repetitively. It's free so I can deal with the ad bombardment."
Pandora,Heavy handed ads on my Kindle Fire HD,PenName1,26-Jan-13,1,"The ads have gotten out of control on my Fire HD. App ads pop up every time I adjust the volume (in Pandora). I had 4 pop ups within the first minute of the 1st song playing immediately after launching Pandora (first time). Not acceptable, think I need to find an alternate program."
Pandora,Pandora Review,Kelly  M. Dutcher,26-Nov-12,5,It's awesome!  Never used it before and never had the chance until I purchased a Kindle.  I love that I can select the type of music I like and listen to it whenever I want to.
Pandora,Pandora is becoming the new classic!,Dey E.,5-Mar-16,4,"I've had a paid subscription to Pandora for about a year now and it's been pretty decent. The service has been almost flawless, a month ago I did an upgrade of the app on my iphone 4s and Pandora started crashing (buffering errors and freezing). It took 2 weeks for a newer version to be available for download, after downloading the newer version the program stopped crashing (buffering errors and freezing). The one other thing that bothers me is that Pandora will not let you skip as many songs as you want, even though you are a paid subscriber. I understand they have to pay for every song played or skipped, but I'm paying them to be able to skip at my leisure and they wont allow it. The stations I create are always compiled great and the thumb print radio feature plays all my likes, which is really cool. There are other music streaming apps out there but to me Pandora is the most well rounded as far as having the most songs and artist I like. I use Pandora on my computer and all my devices, as for now I am going to keep using Pandora until something better is available."
Pandora,I love Pandora,wendy wolber,17-Oct-13,5,I love that I can listen to the kind of music I like when I want to. It's one of my favorite pass times when I'm relaxing in the evenings and on weekends.

Pandora,update broke App completely -,saabstory,19-Apr-16,1,"As stated, last update broke Pandora completely & now hangs instead of loading. When working I'd give it 5 stars - the alarm feature is particularly a plus & when broken it disrupts waking up to Pandora. ..One other thing - Pandora One has promised to work on upgrading stream quality beyond full-blown computers & five years later it's DOA - disappointing."

Or the surprise of hearing a band that Pandora choose in that same line-up that you love as well. We searched for two years for a server, never giving up the hope that we could install wt-fi to receive Pandora in our home. We live in a cabin in the mountains, very isolated, but we searched constantly until we finally found a server in an adjoining state!*!* That's how much I, we, love Pandora*â˜…*"

Sound quality is fixed, but the song name still doesn't change when the song does.Original Review: Audio quality sounds terrible compared to my 2012 KFHD7, I use High Quality in both devices. App does not display the new song title when the song changes. Videos on mobile YouTube sound 10x better than this version of the Pandora App. App needs to be fixed, as it is not playing high quality audio and is not updating the name of the song."

I highly recommend Pandora to all music lovers of all ages!"

Less than a cup of coffee at starshucks. (Spelling intentionally) Would give the app and entertainment a ten star if I could. Commercials on the free app can get a little much but for the most part they were entertaining too. Lots of information about the songs and artists.Can't go wrong."
Pandora,I love how I get to listen to similar types of ...,Amazon Customer,24-Jun-16,5,I love how I get to listen to similar types of music based on the musicians I type in.  Pandora is a great app to listen to music and to listen to new ones I haven't heard of.

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,11-Mar-17,5,love it!!!
Pandora,Evil!,This nerd,4-Apr-13,2,"I like the app and all, but if Pandora is going to say free music, it should be free. Those pirates charged me 99 because apparently I reached my limit of free music for April. Well it's April 4 And I barely even listen to it. Either they fix this or I sue them for lieing about what their product offers. Free music my a$$."
Pandora,"Awsome, but needs more","Amazing, but....",28-Apr-17,5,"I love this app. I have adhd and I use Pandora to help fall asleep. I really like how it picks up what type of music you like.

Pandora,Great substitute for a glovebox full of CD's,Paul A.,23-Feb-16,5,"Very good at stringing together music that sounds sort of like what you typed in.  I particularly like how it is divided into ""stations,"" so as your mood shifts, you can switch stations simply, and get a new vibe.  The ads are a little spooky though.  They are all about home, and when I am on the road, that deprives me of the experience of foreign radio culture."
Pandora,Why don't you have this already?,crysta,2-Dec-16,5,"Pandora is great.  I love it- you can listen to the music you already like and at the same time get introduced to similar artists and songs.  You can search by artist, genre, or song.  It even has some pretty obscure music.  And it's free!  Everyone I know uses Pandora."
Pandora,PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE MADE THIS AN EASY BUY,Appy Lover,18-Apr-16,5,"Create your own stations to personalize what music you hear. Started with Pandora for my desktop and laptop computer, so was very familiar with the software and was an easy decision to get it for my phone."

Pandora,Options wanted,TammyLR,7-May-17,4,I love pandora . The only thing I would change is sometimes when I choose an artist that's what I want to hear that artist. I wish it gave you the option to hear songs from that artist only. It should be also an option to choose to listen the way it is set up now too though.
Pandora,Five Stars,Christopher McIntosh,11-Nov-16,5,Great
Pandora,Great App!,Michelle L. Harvey,24-May-17,5,"We love Pandora. It is great to pick an artist and walk away knowing that we will have hours of music without the hassle of selecting a new album or heaven forbid, changing a CD. We use it at work as background music and love it."
Pandora,awsome,Kindle Customer,21-Nov-12,5,This app is awesome. I don't know why everybody looks at the bad things and never at the good things. Enjoy what you can people. The only bad thing is that you can only skip songs 6 times per hour but still it is a great app.
Pandora,Old fart finds peace with Pandora,Dennis C.,13-Nov-16,5,Ease of use. Lots of choices. Immediate response to your request. Reliable performance.
Pandora,no longer there radio,Steve,17-Apr-13,1,"Pandora is no longer is free, you get a limited time to listen to music each month unless you buy the whole version or pay .99 a month. Even though that's inexpensive why pay to listen to the radio? Download iheartradio, it's the same exact thing legit but completely free."
Pandora,I enjoy what I hear,Barbara M. Bateman,25-Feb-15,5,"You get to pick the artist or the types of songs you like and they play a variety associated with your selection.  They have a ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature to us if you like (they play that song maybe more often and ones like it) or if you don't like a song, they won't play it again.  I'm very happy with the variety of the songs they play"
Pandora,The Very Best,Angie,16-Sep-16,5,"I've used Pandora on other devices in the past and love, love, love it.  It gives me the option of trying out new music before purchase, and also allows me to take some music with me when I leave home.  Great choice of stations to listen to also."

Pandora,Love it,Jennifer,15-Apr-17,5,Its a great way for me to find new music that I love and I can also share new music with my bestie! I can work on homework and not have to sing the same songs repeatedly! My review: love it!!!
Pandora,Favorite music app,Jessica S.,12-Feb-16,5,"With all the music apps that I have downloaded and deleted from my phone, Pandora is the only one I've kept. If I listen to a customized playlist of songs I own, I will eventually get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again. With a station on Pandora, however, I get songs that I familiar with and new songs, in a random order each time. If I don't like a song, I simply hit ""thumbs down"". If I like a song, I hit ""thumbs up"" and it plays more frequently than other songs on that station. Over time, the station becomes so customized that I am listening to lots of songs I like plus new songs I've never heard before. It's nice to shake things up sometimes."
Pandora,Click-free musical bliss.,Sheridan Jackson,27-Oct-16,5,"Music my heart desires, without fuss.  Pandora delivers a delicious balance of inobtrusiveness and  musical satisfaction."

Pandora,Music to drive by....,Kindle Customer,31-May-17,4,Finally followed advice to try this music site. Using free option for listening. Thought by choosing my singer it would be all their music but includes similar genre singers. Ok but not what I expected.

Pandora,"Installed On BlackBerry Classic, But Will Not Launch.  Tips???",Stephen J. Boone,24-Aug-16,4,"EDIT:  Inexplicably, I was finally able to get the app to work, but I don't understand how.  It wasn't showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps, though there was an icon on the home screen.  So, I went to the Amazon App Store, from which I had installed the app, and acted like I wanted to install it again.  It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened.  I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music, then closed the app.  I expected not to be able to re-launch the app, but lo and behold, it launched fine.  I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still wasn't listed, perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store.  Regardless, I'm upping my stars from two to four.I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices, smart TVs, etc., and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic.  It installed, but will not launch.  If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556, I'm all ears!"
Pandora,I love the southern and country but there are so many ...,Amazon Customer,30-Mar-17,4,I love the southern and country but there are so many good songs that we used to sing back in the 50's that are being left out.  So maybe we should have recorded them ourselves in that little church in Colville Washington  like Got Any Rivers you think are uncrossable.  And When God Dips His Love In My Heart  and I'm having trouble with Pandora  music coming on in the middle of the night when I did not set it for that is that at your end oif the line or mine?
Pandora,Easy to use,Wendy Cook,19-Jun-17,5,Downloaded this for my Fire tablet and very pleased. Easy to use and easy to find the music I want. Commercials are short and not intrusive.
Pandora,Smooth Jazz,John P Kolb Jr,15-May-17,5,"Every day as I work on glass, Pandora Media has been the answer to my creative needs."
Pandora,Good music to listen to when working on my 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air......,Mike,13-Nov-17,5,It is easy to use and you can pick the music you like and build your own stations.  I have been using Pandora for well over 10 years and I think it is the best.  You can listen for free and get the occasional ad or pay a very fair monthly price and get ad free music with a lot of neat extras. I miss the days of AM radio with unbiased DJs and good music - the kind of music we listened to when cruising the boulevards back in the early sixties......Pandora brings that time back.  Works well with bluetooth.
Pandora,Pandora's great!,Paul,24-Nov-12,5,"What can I say.  I just discovered Pandora and I love being able to have just the music I want.  there are some commercials but so what, not anymore than you would get on a radio station,(if as many) and you get just what you want."
Pandora,great!,M. Moose,19-May-12,5,"this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too.  this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying.  some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people don't know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and ""artists that you don't like"" very well. this costs $40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora.  I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
Pandora,Great!!!,Mari Cody,25-Jun-16,5,"This app lwets you listen to the songs you love and let's you learn some, as well."
Pandora,Four Stars,nonstopjoe,9-Jun-17,4,"Somewhat difficult to navigate, especially if you're interested in concentrating on a single artist."
Pandora,love it,john,16-Apr-16,5,I have been using this app for years.  It never does me wrong
Pandora,Great app for all kinds of music.,rootytooty,29-Apr-17,5,"We love Pandora.  We listen to it all the time whether at home or on the go.  It has all the songs of the 40s, 50's to present day.  And any kind from Country Western. pop, R&B or what ever.  Great app."
Pandora,Great music app!,sandy5457,13-Jun-16,5,I enjoy being able to listen to any radio station and any genre I want. I sing in the Choir at my Church and I can find the songs we are singing and enjoying listening to what I want.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,29-Apr-17,5,Awesome app. The ability to tailor what I want to listen to is a great feature.
Pandora,Pandora custom radio,T. Murray,10-Mar-15,5,"Pandora is a very user friendly radio app. Its song library is huge, and the programming works great. This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you.  It's important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise.  I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists.  This is an app I use daily."
Pandora,It's cool,Cat Shannon,15-Dec-16,5,"I really enjoy the variety Pandora offers, hate the commercials but still not nearly as bad as regular radio. And finding stations to stream lets me not only enjoy very specific artists but artists associated with them or the time period of the music."
Pandora,Love it!,D. Richardson,30-Aug-13,5,"I love it, use it all the time, it's great for music anytime anywhere, on my phone computer whatever!!!  Thank you!"
Pandora,Music Enjoyment While Cooking,Michele,25-Jul-13,4,"I was very excited to get the Kindle Pandora app.  It is very nice to play music while I cook using the online recipes found on Pinterest or various other websites on my Kindle.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to quit Pandora at first.  There is a Quit option, but you must be on the main screen (the one that displays your stations) to utilize it.  My Kill app wasn't even able to shut it down.  I try to conserve battery life as much as possible.  Once I found that Quit option I was much happier with the app."
Pandora,I love Pandora because it has a wide variety of music ...,Goggy,2-Dec-15,5,My daughter gave me a Bose and showed me how to stream it to my Kindle. She then put Pandora on my Kindle. I now can carry my music to any room I'm in.  I love Pandora because it has a wide variety of music with few ads and it is free!
Pandora,A Great App!!,Bill Ables,29-Sep-16,5,I really enjoy Pandora! I have it on my Phone and now I have it on my Kindle Fire. It's nice to havePandora playing in the background instead of listening to a Radio.I highly recommend this App!
Pandora,Dumbed down and prices raised = lousy annoying arrogant Pandora,JaxRox,15-Aug-17,2,"Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons.  Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month.  Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out.  So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers.  Maybe it's ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music."
Pandora,Bogging down mu phone.,Amazon Customer,11-Nov-11,1,After quiting the app my phone becomes sluggish and unresponsive. Only started immediatly after last update. I have an LG Optimus M. Please fix this problem or I and im sure others will have to remove app and go to Slacker...
Pandora,LIFE= MUSIC,Teena,30-Sep-17,4,"I love listening to music throughout the day and Pandora is a great app for it. I have it on multiple devices, my phone, multiple tv's. I like that there's a great variety and you can choose the style that fits you or your mood even. I listen to my 90's alternative when relaxing with the hubby, country through out the day and ( my little secret lol), old school hip hop when I'm alone and dancing in front of the mirror. Don't act like you've never done it lol ! I do wish that you could skip as many songs as you wanted to on the free version tho and of course it goes without saying, I wish it were completely free but I'm not complaining because it's a great app!"
Pandora,"It is very good, I like that I have looked up songs ...",Richard hoffmire,27-Feb-16,5,"It is very good, I like that I have looked up songs because I could not remember the names of the group that sang the song and it gave me the group's name and the opposite when I have looked up the group for a certain song that I couldn't remember the title of. It has been great been very impressed"
Pandora,Allows access to your Pandora station listing,Mr. Phelps,21-Nov-16,4,"The app allows access to your previously selected stations.  Functions well. Making changes to any of your selections is easier by visiting the website, then use the app to access what you have already set up."
Pandora,Love my pandora!!,Deanna,17-Apr-16,5,"I love Pandora!! I love having all of my favorite music with the click of button. I don't have to worry about filling up my phone with downloaded songs anymore! I especially love the new feature that puts all of your liked songs into a playlist. Good job, Pandora. Don't know what I would do without you!"
Pandora,Awesome!,Farrah,19-Dec-15,5,Pandora saves lives! I listen to Pandora religiously. It adds different music to the station based on things you indicate that you like. It sometimes repeats songs maybe an hour or two after listening to the station but it doesn't happen frequently. I wouldn't know what I would do without this app!
Pandora,I love Pandora!,Mary I Pollock,27-Jul-16,5,"I use Pandora all day long.  I love a diversity in my music and I can change it when ever my mood changes.  I use the alarm to set a sleep time, so I fall asleep before it turns off."
Pandora,Pandora rocks,lakesha wright,8-Mar-16,5,"Love it , I love the different varietys of music it gives you"
Pandora,Wonderful,vallie doughman,20-Dec-13,5,"I love Pandora because I can choose the music I want (or don't want) to listen to.  I can take it with me when I go other places, and I now have it on my phone."
Pandora,Four stars.,Maddy,9-Mar-17,4,"I love Pandora.  They had a really great idea,  and an awesome music selection,  but the reason I gave the app only 4 stars is because the app does not always open when you click on it,  or it looks like it will open then it closes without me ever touching it!  I do realize that the app"
Pandora,best thing since sliced bread,donald,12-Apr-13,5,I bought me a blue tooth portable speaker ( soundfreq) highly recommend it.  Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq.  Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone doesn't like the music i just type in what they like and there happy.  I did have problems getting a specific song but it really didn't matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version.  Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors.
Pandora,pandora rocks,criddle,24-Nov-12,5,it is really cool and awesome because I can create my own personal stations and listen to music whenever and wherever I want to or need to!
Pandora,awesome music app,anonymous,15-Jan-13,4,"great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone, iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of 5 or 6 Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"
Pandora,AMAZING app!,Sherena Schloneger,19-Nov-16,5,This app is AMAZING but when I tilt my kindle sideways the ads cover the screen too much. The last update helped a lot though!
Pandora,You cannot add variety after you create a station :(,Leo9,22-Sep-17,1,"I used to love Pandora, have enjoyed it for years and subscribed to Pandora Plus a long time ago. I used to be able to create a station, and if I encountered a song or artist elsewhere that I enjoyed I could add them to the station later using the Add Variety feature. At least I could do it on my desktop app. However, that feature has apparently been removed. So now, once I create a station it's seeds are locked and I am stuck with the option of only liking/disliking the music that the station provides.There is still a Pandora Help page on how to Add Variety, but it's instructions don't work. I will stay with Pandora only because I have so much invested in the stations that I have created. But unless and until they include Add Variety again, I would NOT recommend this to a new user. I only hope that they include it again soon."
Pandora,Its very very good!,Tomboy gamer,6-Dec-16,4,"I love it an all but I have FULL INTERNET CONNECTION AND IT SAYS, ""Sorry waiting for connection"" Dang it!"
Pandora,Love the new update!,P. Hyder,22-Sep-12,5,this new update lets you view the lyrics and I love it! And they play the same ad over and over because that's who payed for it duh !
Pandora,Best Free Music App On Any Operating System,Doleman,26-Sep-14,5,"By now anyone with a smart device should know or had tried the Pandora app. If you have not, you have been missing out on a ton of high quality, 100% free music. I have been using this App for years, since my first iPhone 3G. This has been by far my favorite music app.+ Free! Who doesn't like free?!+ High quality sound. Even with a weak signal, Pandora plays like these songs are stored in my phone.+ A wide variety of stations to choose from. Rock, country, hip hop, R&B, jazz, classical, electronic, disney, and even music from movies! Also by year, the 70s, 80s, 90s, latest hits, Pandora has it all.+ Create your own group of music. If you only favor a few bands, even from different genre, you can combine them in a group so it will only play the type that you enjoy listening.+ Thumb up and down system. If there is a song you like, thumb it up and it will play more often or more of the same artist. Thumb down and it will never be played again.+ Alarm clock! With the latest update Pandora offers your favorite station as your alarm clock. This will ensure to get you moving and not hit that snooze button!+ No commercial or interruption! This could just be me, I use the same account for my mobile device and my pc. When I listen on my pc there is zero commercial. On my phone however there is ads once in awhile. Not sure what triggers it. But the ads are always short and happens every few songs.Give it a try and you won't regret it. I have been using this for years and even after trying others, I prefer Pandora."
Pandora,Not happy,Amazon Customer,5-Dec-16,1,Won't let me sign up...age discrimination?
Pandora,"Music, Music, Music",catwat,15-May-17,3,"Sound quality on a kindle is not that great.  Also, if you stop thumbing, it shuts off."
Pandora,Best streaming option.,Wounded Knee,15-Aug-17,5,"Absolutely the best source of music streaming.  Not that there aren't other good ones...  Pandora is just a little above all of the others.  Pandora gives you 3 choices of service level. I recently switched from ""some"" commercials to the lower of two commercial free options.  All 3 are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this ""mid-level"" of service for some time to come.  I really appreciate the ability to listen off line when there is no good streaming source available."
Pandora,I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite ...,Kindle Customer,14-Jul-16,5,I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite artists and also the suggestions of artists that are similar to the ones that I selects which introduce me to new artists.
Pandora,Love,Liv,1-Jan-17,4,I love music and I love love love this app! Definitely recommend!!! It works very good I just wish that you could save songs from it and create like an album with the songs you saved so then you can listen to the music you like without needing  WiFi. I would really love to listen to the music when I'm on a road trip and my kindle is not connected. Other than that I am extremely satisfied with Pandora!
Pandora,I love pandora,Rockstarmom!!,9-May-17,5,"I absolutely love this APP. I downloaded right to my home screen so I have easy access to get to it faster . Great tutorials to teach you how to use this app and so much fun . i love all the genras of music to choose from.If this review has helped you in any way please check ""yes"" belowâ€_. Many Thanks!I would recommend this product to friends and family."
Pandora,Doesn't let you log in.,gretchen l. smith,30-May-17,1,"This is just plain stupid!  You can't even log in whithout it saying ""please enter a vallid email adress.""  So if this is quite glitch or whayever then could you fix it."

Pandora,Five Stars,Paul,14-Mar-17,5,"Thankyou, Pandora!"
Pandora,PANDORA,TRACI HOLMES,30-Jun-16,5,What can I say this app rocks. No pun intended. Pandora has the capability to understand your music choices and with that they get your music preferences down and provide music that you will enjoy.
Pandora,I love the fact that you get to create different staions ...,Amazon Customer,19-Oct-16,5,I love the fact that you get to create different staions and you choose what you want to listen to according to your mood i think.

Pandora,Cancelled my paid subscription.,NathanW,7-Jun-17,2,"I've been a Pandora One customer for four years. Today I cancelled my subscription. Why? Because they went from allowing two devices to stream at one time to just one device at a time. No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can't do that anymore. When I contacted them they didn't seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account (at a higher rate). I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I'd paid for the last four years: $3.99 and the new account paying MORE at $4.99. No thanks."
Pandora,Omg,Autumn,1-Jul-17,1,"The app said it was trying to connect, when I had full bars. Why is it doing this?"
Pandora,The Music You Like When You Want It,A.J.O. From California,31-May-14,5,"Pandora lets You choose who you listen to and what you listen to. It also allows you to eliminate the Songs, Artist, or Genre that you don't like.. Plus, You can create many different Stations for your listening pleasure by simply typing an Artist name or the Genre. Soon after ""Pandora"" will start to recognize your personal taste in music and play similar Artist, Songs,or Styles of music for you, but ultimately YOU decide what stays and what goes by clicking ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"", or if your not in the mood for a particular song, you'll always have the option to just ""Skip it"". I Love ""Pandora""! and You will too. I hope this review was helpful."
Pandora,Five Stars,anna-lee waggoner,31-Oct-16,5,I like the fact that I can choose my own music and I can also save them
Pandora,Free Music!,R. Toro,25-Apr-12,5,"If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99.  That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."
Pandora,5 stars!!,mduty9317,25-Feb-16,5,5 stars! I love this music app!!
Pandora,I like that there is no DJ,Steve,9-Apr-17,4,"Less expensive than slacker. I like that there is no DJ. Not as detail as slacker, I just keep it on certain settings though and I am Fine. The realaxation station which I use at Night is excellent. I never heard music like that before. During the day I just set it to Led Zepplin and it plays music I like. The smooth jazz station was  good also."
Pandora,Stays connected to the internet,Mal,9-Aug-16,5,"After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best.  The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all).  Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.  Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music.  It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements.  Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
Pandora,Songs never finish,311IO7,13-Nov-11,1,"I have been a long time user of Pandora on the web, blackberry and Android. Recently this app has not been allowing me to hear entire songs. a song will start and play for a short amount of time before abruptly skipping to the next. This now happens consistently and I never get to hear an entire song. I'm very disappointed and will be deleting this app after submitting this review."
Pandora,SCAM !!!!,F.A,15-Oct-16,1,WHAT A SCAM PANDORA IS !!!! It is literally impossible to cancel my subscription!
Pandora,I love this app,McCormack,14-Jun-16,5,I love this app!  So easy to use! And free is always awesome!I love to have it playing all day.  I love the mix that Pandora generates.I can listen to whatever style of music matches my mood that day!
Pandora,Pandora's new GUI is awfull!,Alan Darge,7-Apr-17,3,"Pandora is a great music player. I like the selection of music they play for me in the four or five genres I play the most. There are a few advertisements per hour in the free version and that's tolerable.I gave them only three stars because the new user interface is absolutely horrible. Pandora must have been compelled to make things move and make information disappear from view until you direct the cursor over the pictures to make the information visible again. Why? The old interface was simple, clear and functional. Some inexperienced kid out of college must have needed a job and Pandora hired the kid to make the GUI as hard to use as possible. But, the music is good. They don't make it, just play it."
Pandora,love,jason,24-Nov-12,5,cause it has everything i want.i would reccomend to everyone.i have tried other ones and they play what i like.
Pandora,GREAT,reveiw,19-Jul-17,5,Besides the commercials its a great music app that will lead you to like the other alike artists and it wont play the songs you give a thumbs down to
Pandora,I love Pandora but...,daniel,29-Oct-16,4,Pandora has an amazing selection of radio stations and I'm so glad we can further edit them to our preferences! But I am saddened by the fact that if my kindle screen goes idle the music consistently skips unlike when the screen is active where it might skip once in an hour. Also different than my cell phone which doesn't skip at all. If it weren't for that issue this would likely be a five star!!!!
Pandora,Pandora is the best entertainment value around.,Craig J. Anderson,1-Mar-17,5,I couldn't live without Pandora.  I subscribed.  Best entertainment value around.
Pandora,A Great Place for Music,Keith B.,20-Apr-16,4,"I use Pandora with my Amazon Echo more than any other streaming service. They seem to have the fewest commercials and play some great artists that relate well to the station I've chosen. To be honest I've only downloaded the app because I don't want to drag my Echo into the steamy bathroom. I use the Pandora app to pair my tablet with a waterproof speaker I listen to in the shower. I've created all my stations already with the Echo so although it works just fine all I really do with the app is scroll until I find what I want to listen to for that shower, start it playing and then walk away. It does what I need it to do and the music it picks no matter what 'station' I'm listening to is truly top notch.In a nutshell, I really don't do a lot with the app but it does what I need quite well."
Pandora,Fan for Years,Bob Lawes,15-Sep-17,5,"I've been a fan of Pandora for years with my computer, my phone, and now my tablet.  I get to pick the music, even if we have to go back to the 1940s to get the songs and bands that play real music, not just noise."
Pandora,Music is life,FaerieTxn,7-Jun-17,4,Pandora is great for customizing and variety but the commercials are annoying lol still better than FM radio though!!
Pandora,Enjoy it,Christine V. Carothers,27-Aug-13,5,"I enjoy having this on my kindle, fun to listen to music while reading my email or checking out  facebook"
Pandora,Pandora is awesome :),Monica Schmidt,1-Sep-17,5,Omg Pandora is so cool you can listen to all different types of music and it is just so awesome
Pandora,"Always liked Pandora, Also have Desktop App From Inception!",LynchU,18-Apr-14,5,"I use other music services too, but Pandora is a go to.Don't forget, that it is enjoyable to get specific music you like to listen too.  It seems this will be a standard now.In order to preserve all these services, don't forget to shut it down when your not listening.  Mind you, they don't pay a lot of money to the music industry per song, but those costs can build up.  Act accordingly, and services like this will get better and better. Or go out of business."
Pandora,Pandora is my favorite Music App,FLU99,8-Aug-15,5,"This was very easy to upload to my Amazon Fire Phone and my Fire 7. Pandora is my favorite music app. No matter what kind of music you like or what mood you are in, you are sure to find music that you love! I love that you can customize your music listening to your liking. I like all kinds of music from James Taylor to Metallica to Bruno Mars and with Pandora, I can set it up to listen to whatever I am feeling that day! I highly recommend this for your music app!"
Pandora,Crapiest radio app ever.,NamiSan337,31-May-17,1,"Its the dumbest radio app ever, when I'm using my aunts internet (its rlly good internet) it says ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""When I'm at a laundry mat, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My house, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My parents house ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""  This app is the crapiest app ever. I don't think you should get this app. IHeartRaido is way better than this. Fix it. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
Pandora,Best music app by far,Amy Showalter,30-Mar-16,5,Best music app by far. Easy to create channels for all types of music genres and navigation back and forth between them. I eventually purchased the upgrade so that I didn't have to deal with listening to ads between songs. I highly recommend taking that route if you plan on using this as your primary source for listening to music.
Pandora,Great App!,By   Jbird,7-Jul-16,4,"I love Pandora! Great Channels, great music, everything! But, some songs are super laggy and other times the apps closes on me and stops playing music. Is there were no problems, I would rate this app five star."
Pandora,I love it and use it daily on every device I ...,Steve Kamerick,8-Nov-17,5,"Don't know why this is here on Amazon, unless they are trying to compare Amazon Prime music with Pandora. OK, I have been a member/customer of Pandora for 9 years, and once quit using because of too many ads, when they quit the distasteful number of ads on free I went back and next decided to go to Pandora-One and recently went even further to Pandora ultimate with no ads at all. I love it and use it daily on every device I own.  I have no complaints. The music is clear and good EQ, perfect for headphones, all Bluetooth speakers and love the stories of the lives of artists."
Pandora,Pandora - I'll Pass,Ricochet,29-Sep-16,2,"Pandora is my first streaming music experience.  The more I use it, the more I dislike it.  Its song library is extremely limited compared to other providers.  There is very little variety and you hear the same songs over and over if you pick two stations with similar genres.  Buy Pandora One and you still CANNOT skip an unlimited number of songs.  This is total crap. Whats premium if you can control the content.  Don't subscribe and you have to listen to lame ads where people repeat their phone number over and over and over.  Keeping the app as a back up, but moving on to something with a larger library, less repetition and more robust features."
Pandora,Kindle Edition Is Not Working Out For Me,Duwayne Cole,19-Oct-15,3,"The Kindle Edition of Pandora is good when it works, but that isn't often. The app closes on me frequently, especially when I have a good rotation of songs going. I do not use it on my Kindle Fire as often as I would like because of this. I've updated my device and the app itself and have seen absolutely no improvement on performance. Hopefully, this issue can be resolved in the near future, because I use my Kindle Fire quite often and I would love not to have to juggle two devices just to listen so music."
Pandora,great for listening to all types of music,suzyq,24-Nov-12,5,this is a great music app. It allows you to customise the stations you wish to listen to artist. It is nice to listen to music without interruptions.
Pandora,Is it worth it,Joey,6-Mar-16,4,I'll be honest Pandora is good at what it does. But it has gone down in quality with all the adds seeing as how every two or so songs I have to deal with 4 adds each time so yeah it's a good app but do you think it's worth paying or waiting through the adds.
Pandora,One of the best music apps!,LSAnderson40,8-Aug-17,5,"We have been big fans of Pandora since it was released. We love picking an artist and letting the algorithm make really good selections based on that initial artist selection. Also, the application is portable across devices making it ideal for listening anytime. Couple this app with a bluetooth speaker and voila you have your tunes for any occasion."
Pandora,Amazing!!!!,Vixen,3-Apr-16,5,I LOVE THIS APP!!! It is amazing. You can make any station you want. Now that they have Thumbprint radio it is 10x better. Thumbprint radio is a station that only plays the songs that you have liked. It's amazing! I very much recommend this app!
Pandora,Pandora is my Magic Box,Karen L.,23-Jun-13,5,"Music is my passion. I love many genres.  However, it was difficult to know how to access new music.  By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world.  I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals.  I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music.  Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift!  I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!"
Pandora,Amazing,Amazon Customer,2-Feb-17,5,This app is so cool! You dont need wifi so you can listen to you fav songs anywhere!! This is my favorite app_Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜†
Pandora,I love it!,Jemma,12-Jun-17,4,"I've always loved Pandora. So its awesome to me. But sometimes it stops in the middle of nowhere. I'm like "" Really"". But I still love it and you should too."
Pandora,Replacing Radio,Karen Fischer,8-Sep-13,5,"I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Roku about 2-3 years ago.  I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death.  With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio.  You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre.  You can chose any group you like.  Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music.  I recommend Pandora to everyone!"
Pandora,This is my first time trying Pandora I really like it as soon as you touch the icon it ...,julie,14-Oct-17,5,This is my first time trying Pandora I really like it as soon as you touch the icon it pops up and it starts playing your music and I love that you have so many choices to choose from someone calls that call ends and it comes right back on I love that I know there's lots of other options and I haven't had it long enough to actually get into that an like read all about it I plan on doing that because you can actually like download songs and take them like anywhere with you so anywhere you're at you have your favorite music and I love that too try it out you'll love it too
Pandora,Pandora_Ÿ˜„,I am awesomeness &#55357;&#56498;,3-Dec-16,5,I love Pandora you can get so many stations!
Pandora,A song for every season,Jacki Prettyman,18-Jan-13,5,"Pandora has a genre of songs for any music lover and the best part is that it syncs to my smartphone, computer and Roku. If I sign in on what ever device, there is my list! Great selection of 70's rock, contemporary Christian and Cool Jazz."
Pandora,Listen to the music you want to hear.,George G Shelton,5-Feb-17,5,I use Echo to access Pandora.  I have asked it to play several different genres of music and it always responds with a nice variety of songs and different artists.  When I ask for a particular artist it plays only songs by that artist.  My only complaint is that the volume control don't control the volume of commercials at the same level as the music.. The commercials are always louder.
Pandora,Favorite,Kellytjtay,1-Jun-16,5,"I love the variety of music that you can get with Pandora, and I especially love the fact that you can set the station to whoever your favorite artist is. This is so easy and convenient. Pandora has to be one of my all-time favorite applications."
Pandora,"Pandora music your way, you choice!",Evelynnec,8-Aug-15,5,"I truly enjoy this app for music.  I choose what I want to hear, and when I want to hear it.  I have the capability to set music stations that I like the way I like.  I have stations to get me going, stations for background, and for falling to sleep.  The commercials are not a deterrent for me, there are less than the radio.  Which by the way I never listen to now, Pandora all the time."
Pandora,The original is still the best.,Paul A. Cuff,18-Jun-17,5,Great streaming channel with a wide variety of music.
Pandora,A decade behind!!!,Lostandbored,7-Sep-17,1,I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I've been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page.
Pandora,ITS THE BEST,Lindsay Wheat,26-Feb-17,5,THANK YOU FOR THIS I NEEDED IT :) :)
Pandora,Great!,Tony,10-Jun-17,5,"Great! You get just what you want, when you want it unlike AM or FM radio."
Pandora,Pandora - so much more evolved than listening to the radio!,Foxliam,26-Aug-12,5,I love the Pandora app.  I can customize it to play the type of music that I want to listen to. I can see the name of the songs and who is singing them complete unlike listening to the radio.  No call letters of the radio station being blared at me every minute...just music.  You can select whatever stations that you like and give a thumbs up rating to the songs you love to keep them playing when you want to hear them in the future.
Pandora,Free Pandora App for Kindle Fire,C. Hyde,26-Dec-12,5,"I love love love Pandora & have used it for a few years now!! You can't get much better than free, but may consider upgrading to Pandora 1, especially since I use Pandora on my Kindle now & not just on my computer. The ad's that pop up are a bit annoying. When you play Pandora on your laptop or computer they may play a quick add after every 5-6 or sometimes as long as every 8-10 songs but on the kindle ad's pop up almost one after the other. If you hit the X to x out of one, another pops up almost immediately :/ mildly annoying but what can you expect for free, huh?"
Pandora,Discovered through my husband around 2011/2012,Stella Carrier,12-Dec-14,5,"I admit that I cannot remember the exact timeframe that I discovered Pandora, but I believe that it was sometime around summer or autumn 2011 when my husband played music from the app during one of our quiet moments together.  I enjoy that there is a wide range of stations and music genres that one can listen to. Iâ€™m open-minded when it comes to willingness to listen to various types of music. Right now, the top three music stations that I am listening to on Pandora the most are chillout, electronica, and indie dance, although I have to humbly credit recently finding out about indie dance from a public relations specialist named heather whaling of geben communication- who listed indie dance being one of their fave stations online. Sometimes I go ahead and also shuffle the over 20 plus radio stations that are set in my Pandora profile in order to listen to satisfy  my eclectic tastes in music. Many of my online music purchases have been influenced by many of the songs and artists I heard on Pandora."
Pandora,NOT BAD AT ALL,Bill McLean,23-Sep-13,4,"Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc.  And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night.  Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.Still, I do not expect to use it very much.  I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music.  But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment."
Pandora,Pandora is the absoute best for music listening!,Michelle Wilson,3-May-17,5,Love Pandora!  Listen to it every day!  Love that I can listen to different genre's of music depending on my mood.
Pandora,perfect,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-13,5,"It's the perfect radio, I highly recommend having this app! Just watch out if u don't have unlimited data and its all good. Great for anyone who loves music."
Pandora,Who doesn't like Pandora? I've had it for almost 10 years ...,D. Lange,29-Oct-17,5,"Who doesn't like Pandora? I've had it for almost 10 years so of course I had to add it to my new Kindle. Its FREE, and I love that I can have my own personal stations filled with music I like. I have a different station for every genre of music or mood I'm in. The thumbs up or down feature is really nice so I never have to hear a song I donâ€™t like. Sure I could pay a fee to have the ads removed, but they only run about every 5th or 6th song and theyâ€™re short, not at all like on TV. So its worth it to me to have it for free."

Pandora,I like the app,LLee,16-Dec-12,4,"I like this Pandora app for Kindle.  It plays fine & I have not had any problem with force closing.  The only thing I don't like is the pop-ups during play. It doesn't interfere with the player,  I just don't care for it."
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,16-May-17,4,I really really enjoy
Pandora,Could use improvement,morgan,7-Feb-17,3,"I enjoy Pandora, but it could definitely be better.  I do not like the loud commercials.  They are extremely irritating so I either turn off the sound or turn off Pandora when they come on.  Even more disconcerting is when I am listening to Jose Cura a nd other tenors, I suddenly get hit with Heavy Metal!  Definitely not in my comfort zone."
Pandora,Amazing,Jonny,16-Feb-17,5,This app is not like others. It allows you to sing along with the lyrics option. In my opinion that is great.

Pandora,Sit and listen,Chatalia,23-Jul-17,4,"Hard to keep on track of songs you like unless you are right there to give thumbs up or down. With some artists once one "" off "" type song get in your set, a lot of other strays get mixed in. Also, even when you do thumbs down on some songs, they still play, but you will get an error message."
Pandora,Five Stars,Dedra J.,13-Oct-17,5,Easy and love it!
Pandora,my music my way,Michelle Childs,22-Jul-17,5,i love this it is so many different ways to listen to my kind of music so many selections of songs i created my own music station i wish there was a way you could use your station as a ringtone every time your phone rings a different song would play that would be amazing
Pandora,Love music!,Bella,20-Jul-17,5,"Love music!!! Love Pandora!!!  The best music selection from oldies to today's greatest hits.  Whatever my mood is Pandora will oblige.My brother is in a nursing home and wanted to listen to some Al Green.  He is very old school, does not know anything about streaming or apps.  As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!""  My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing.  We had a BLAST!!!  Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on.  Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music."
Pandora,Used to be great. Not so much anymore. Get spotify.,Jason,9-Aug-17,3,"The playlists can range from outstanding to complete garbage. Also, there are way too many ads. Pandora has fallen far."
Pandora,WORKS GREAT DONT BELIVE ALL THOSE HATERS,Daniel,22-Dec-12,5,"This apps works great I can listen to music and play order and chaos online. It only stops because you have bad wifi and the commercial happen like every 7 songs to me ands there only 30 sec. I love it I can listen to all my favorite bands like The Ghost Inside, Parkway Drive, Carpathian, Stick to your Guns, and Killswitch engage. Get it who doesn't like FREE MUSIC"
Pandora,Love my Pandora.,Barbara Mayer,1-Dec-14,5,Love Pandora. I can listen to all types of music. I have at least 20 different styles of music and keep adding to when I hear something I like. I love to put it on shuffle when I am reading and listen to everything from meditative and instrumental to oriental and classical. Money well spent.
Pandora,well it was good!,Hartleysmom,29-Aug-13,1,This was a fantastic app until one day it decided to stop working. Nothing more than a blue Pandora screen now :(
Pandora,Music I like!!!!,Joe Joe Gadget,9-Jan-13,5,"Pandora is a great radio app.IMO much better than mobile Spotify!!Just type in a favorite artist or song & a station(s) will be created for you.As you rate the songs it will personalize the selections over time.I'm very happy I installed this app.Best thing is you can put your device in standby & the music still plays while saving battery life.Sound quality is FANTASTIC!!!  Enjoy.....JoeUpdate:Noticed something that really pees me off!! In between songs or after ads I noticed songs listed as played that never played.You can't go back & play them,you can rate them.Just a bit aggravating when a sucky song comes on & a great song was skipped(not by me)!!! I still love the app!!(tunein is better though)"
Pandora,Pandora rocks...or pops...or jazzes...whatever you want!,Cheree,28-Feb-14,5,"Pandora was recommended to me by a friend, so I downloaded it to my Kindle fire. Quick and easy download as usual for the fire...very easy to start navigating around the app with no real instruction needed. I did not use the instructional ""get started"" guide that is provided. I quickly created some stations based on my many moods and am pleased to say that it has become my favorite source of music at work! I use the free version and do not find the ads to be too intrusive. Well worth the download!"
Pandora,Love music,Brittany Dreiling,20-May-17,5,Love the wide variety of music and options!
Pandora,I have some concerns,megan barbazon,18-Jun-16,3,Its cool and all just there's no search it only has a few songs I like it but it needs some more things to it. Spotify is way better!
Pandora,Kindle Pandora App works great!,Rex Cruse,6-Sep-17,5,"The Pandora app sounds great on my Kindle Fire HD.  I prefer Pandora for streaming because I like several genre of music, including jazz and Brazilian.  Pandora makes accessing the sounds and instruments I like easy.  Pandora definitely targets well."
Pandora,Does not work,Jake (Mr. Dude),16-Aug-13,1,I've never been able to get this app to actually play music. It simply opens up a screen with the logo and does nothing else. Not sure whats going on.
Pandora,My go to music player,Kendra poaches,26-Oct-16,5,Just letting everyone know that Summer Hits of the 90s is the best station on here
Pandora,Love it!,C Ruppert,28-Oct-16,5,I love the Pandora app!
Pandora,"Edgy, Artistic Opportunity",Kevin L. Nenstiel,29-Dec-12,5,"Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying."
Pandora,Not only listening pleasure but discovery and knowledge,Mike Tarrani,2-Oct-13,5,"I'll attempt to not repeat what other reviews have said because there are nuances to Pandora that go beyond a convenient way to listen to the music you love.The first thing I love is the way artists whose work is related to your favorites that you specify in channels are slipped in. I have discovered more musicians (and albums) that I would have never thought of on my own through that feature.I also love that I can easily peruse a mini biography of the artist on any currently playing song, as well as features of the track itself. For example, listening to bassist Ron Carter's album titled Saguaro I discovered that the key features of the track for Piccolo include block chords on the piano and it's in a minor key. That information cues me to listen to those more carefully, which is a boon for musicians.Another feature with which I am currently experimenting is the connect-to-facebook link that will not only alert friends to what I am listening to (although I have that hidden using facebook's privacy settings), but a monthly summary of my listening habits published on my timeline. That I do find useful!The ads can be somewhat tiresome, but when I weight that minor inconvenience against the way Pandora's insertion of related music into my channel plays I can live with it with a smile. I have been exposed to a much wider range of music and artists than I ever was before Pandora came along, and this app is the key.For the record this review is of version 4.1.2, which is the latest as of the date of this review. Features may change, obviously, so take this date and version into consideration as you read this review."
Pandora,Pandora,EAlfaro,3-Jul-13,5,I am technically ignorant and was very glad my children showed me how to have music at the touch of my hands anytime I wanted.
Pandora,Good free music app with lots of variety,Jamie E.,3-Nov-14,4,"Not a bad free music app.  You can select albums, artists etc to listen to.  Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play.  You have no control over specific songs though.  Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you are listening too.  Sometimes it is great, others can be disappointing.  However if you want only the one album of specific song this does not work so well.  If you do not like wha tis playing, you are limited to how many songs you can skip.  And there are a fair share of ad interruptions.  The other downside is that it takes a bit ti shut down the app and are constantly sending update notifications and thus far I have not figured out a way to stop them.But regardless, this is free and can still be great.  I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I am cleaning, exercising or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there are less interruptions here than on a live radio station.  They have a good variety of music on it but seem limited to US artists so far mostly."
Pandora,Good app for an older streaming service,Melody,7-Sep-14,4,"What happened to Pandora?? I'm just cruising along with life when all of a sudden I realize how times have changed and Spotify seems bigger in the market than Pandora.  I feel like I just got old at the thought of how things have changed.But, this app holds up respectably in terms of ease of use and ability to stream music without lag.  I admit I have become more of a Spotify user myself, but for old times' sake, Pandora is just as great of a music streaming service.  The app performs decently as well."
Pandora,Why the Hate?,A.Searson,8-Jul-12,5,"I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)"
Pandora,Best music service company bar none,Albert B.,30-Sep-17,5,"I have had Pandora Music Service for a number of years and am a regular subscriber. I think  Pandora is the best music service on the market. Music choice, ease of use, especially the ""quick mix option"", and the annual cost make it virtually unbeatable."
Pandora,Superb player held back by an American-style jumble of IP holders.,Amazon Customer,6-Nov-13,4,"I'd never be able to broaden my horizons if not for Pandora. I don't even bother with owning an archive anymore. However, the song selection is a bit limited, and some of the hoops Pandora has to jump through to keep its numerous license-holders happy end up putting odd quirks in the program. It will never be Spotify, but it's not enough to detract from the program, and Pandora One is dirt-cheap compared to other advertisement-free tiers in other programs.Despite any possible shadows of disadvantage, Pandora has changed my relationship with music."
Pandora,... long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up,Claire M,23-Aug-17,5,"It didn't take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear (not what a local station thinks that I want to hear). The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, 14 months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
Pandora,A Treasure Box of Music Just Waiting For You To Let Pandora Out of the Box,RonaldDerGrosse,8-May-16,5,If you like music you can't beat this app. It plays only the types of music that you like to hear. If a choice of a song is not to your liking just give it a thumbs down and it is gone. I chose four different genres of music when I first got the app and listened for two hours and only snubbed two songs. I felt like it read my mind as to what I would play from my personal record collection. The ads are not that frequent  and do not last long either. Get this app now and you won't be sorry.
Pandora,Its Perfect!,Pandora User,8-Apr-12,5,Pandora has an organized layout and also you can thumb down and up songs also pause and more. For Kindle Fire you can shut your screen off then power the screen on on a commercial video and come back to the next song!!
Pandora,why pay big bucks for xm/serius when you can listen for free !,joker1,16-Jul-17,5,"dont pay for xm/serius when you have pandora for free ! much better when you can control your music with likes,and dislikes. and if you want more control you can pay $5 a month more and get it all !  luv it , luv it, can't get enuf of it !"
Pandora,I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind ...,Christina,1-Feb-17,5,I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind the advertisements which is why I would pay for the no adds deal. Now since they update the get more skip buy watch a video is more pleasing to my enjoyment.
Pandora,Some things ARE never ending.,KUMI ORI,2-Jan-17,3,"Although it's free, it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music, but then it shuts off to ask if you're still listening!!! Good music, and sounds like a radio with commercials, but stop asking if we're still listening, someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,23-Mar-17,5,great music selection
Pandora,"I love portable music!  I can hear anything I want, anytime.  Great app.",Denise Roberge,15-Mar-16,4,"I really enjoy Pandora very much.  The only problem I've had is very occasional dead air for a minute here and there.  I dislike the commercials.  I have a Bluetooth Speaker and I get to bring Pandora with me wherever I go!  Great for gatherings of any sort.  I also use it as background for my Meditation classes.  An  amazingly huge amount of music, all genres, are available.  Love it!"
Pandora,Music everywhere!,Cheri,9-Jun-16,5,I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials aren't as bad as you find on the radio.
Pandora,I like Pandora to play when I'm cooking or sleeping,Rachael Reine MacArthur,5-Jun-17,5,"I like Pandora to play when I'm cooking or sleeping, but it sometimes is hit or miss with the play selections."
Pandora,Five stars _Ÿ_¶,Colderabyss90,22-Mar-17,5,I gave this music app five stars because of the wide range of stations and diversity of songs provided and unlike YouTube when you leave the app the songs don't stop they continue to play. One good thing about Pandora is that the adds aren't as bad they don't show up a lot. Thanks Pandora for the best free music app anyone has to offer
Pandora,When u select your stations they play a great variety. I can go from Madonna to Eydie ...,jt3,30-May-17,5,When u select your stations they play a great variety.  I can go from Madonna to Eydie Gorme to the Doors to Patsy Cline.  I do not like that you cannot repeat or restart a song.
Pandora,easy to use,Sarah B.,31-May-16,5,"Same as the website, easy to use, my son (7yo) has his music playing non-stop on his kindle at home.If my review was helpful, please hit ""yes""!"
Pandora,Music Site Of Choice,Christine,17-May-16,5,"I've used Pandora for many years. It's one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. It's not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. It's called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."
Pandora,I love it,Mandy,9-Mar-17,5,Everyone get it
Pandora,Love music!,Hikin',28-Sep-16,4,"I really like the variety of music. I have mine on shuffle so I will have a 60's song, then a country, then rock and roll! It is great, except of course the commercials, but there are like gobs of them!"

Pandora,A Godsend to Music Lovers!,Pie Grrrl,3-Feb-13,5,"How long have I been listening to Pandora? Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that's how long ago I've been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over 52 different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to 5 different Christmas stations (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!). I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there's a wee box of ""arrows"" that you click so you can find out 1) Lyrics to most songs; 2) About the Artist; 3) WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. ""Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing."" You also have the ability to ""Bookmark"" any song that you like, so you don't have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember ""Who WAS that awesome artist?""And, if you take the small effort to ""Thumb's Up/Down"" a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookmarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can't be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.And ""Yes!"", I'm a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? :)"
Pandora,What's not to love?,GReed,21-Sep-16,5,"What's not to love? Pick your music choices, use shuffle for a mix up and there is your evening's background music."
Pandora,Five Stars,Sam,3-Mar-17,5,works great
Pandora,Good music you like. You pick what you want to listen too...free,Hugo H.,13-Jul-17,5,Pandora is a great music app. Even though it doesn't play a specific song it allows you to pick a specific music category that you enjoy listening to. I use it often and because it's free it's even better.
Pandora,Best site for music,Lucy,24-Jan-17,5,"I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
Pandora,PANDORA,S----W.,8-Mar-14,5,"THIS IS THE GREATEST OFFER FOR LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC. I WANTED TO HEAR MUSIC LIKE BONNIE RAIT AND BY SELECTING THIS ARTIST ON PANDORA,  IT PLAYED HER AND  MUSICIANS LIKE HER AND IT WAS GREAT. THEN I WANTED TO HEAR SOME SOFT EASY LISTENING PIANO MUSIC TO READ BY AND SELECTED FLOYD CRAMMER AND YES PANDORA, BROUGHT UP FLOYD CRAMMER AND OTHER GREAT PIANIST.  MY HUSBAND ENJOYS MUSICIAN LIKE HANK, WAYLON & WILLY SO, NOW HE CAN HEAR HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS AND OTHERS LIKE THESE ARTIST. WE HAVE HAD PANDORA FOR A MONTH AND WE BOTH ENJOY LISTENING TO OUR PANDORA.WE TURN IT ON AND LISTENING TO IT ALL DAY AS WE GO ABOUT OUR DAY AT HOME. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."

Pandora,New website stinks!,ResvorDog,29-Apr-17,2,"The new site is awful!  It is significantly more complicated to use, especially when editing stations.  This now requires a four step process instead of one.  How stupid is that?!?!?  The new site wastes so much space that could be used for navigation purposes.  Music and cost is the same, but the new site STINKS!!!  It's like going back in time 10 years."
Pandora,"I really like Pandora, but I'd like it better if I ...",Sunnygirl,25-Jan-17,4,"I really like Pandora, but I'd like it better if I were able to choose which songs I wanted to hear instead of having to listen to only those chosen for me."
Pandora,For music lovers,Amazon Customer,5-Apr-14,4,"I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it.  I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind.  There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs.  Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many.  For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
Pandora,Pilot of the Airwaves,dweeb,4-Sep-17,5,"Pandora is the best effort yet to allow each of us to be our own disc jockey. Take an artist, a song or a genre and use Pandora to build a total environment and system of sound. Simply sublime!"

Pandora,The greatest. I gave up the radio a long time ago.,Amazon Customer,6-Sep-17,5,"I have subscribed to Pandora for years. It is great to have on our Amazon ""Alexa"". All I have to do is open the station I want, ""Alexa, Hillsong from Pandora"". Then as I listen to the songs I tell Alexa, I like this song or I don't like this song"". If it is saved as a ""like"" or a ""dislike"" I am building my own station."
Pandora,Great service,Karen Elaine,22-Jul-17,4,"Very cool.  I remember the days when you had to buy every piece of music you wanted to listen to, even if only once or twice.  To have custom radio stations of your own to call on is lovely."

Pandora,Great Music App,R. Conyers,20-May-13,4,"I got this app years ago and loved it right away.  This app tailors the music to your liking. Unlike other music apps this one is don't just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts.  For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper.  The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs.  You have to purchase it to be commercial free."
Pandora,Five Stars,Rosemary Salvemini,17-Mar-17,5,Great app
Pandora,Listen all the time.,Matthew D Myers,30-Aug-13,5,Listen to it all the time.  Love forming my channels into the perfect mix.  I like the random quality of a music mix when I don't know what is coming on next.

I have used each of the stations often enough to indicate many ""thumbs up"" recordings that I enjoy on that station.  In addition to hearing my ""thumbs up"" favorites, I also am introduced to other, similar recordings and artists on each station that I also enjoy discovering and adding to my list.  Charles McKay"
Pandora,Pandora.... plays the best variety of songs that I like to listen to out there,Garysgal888,16-Dec-13,5,"Love this app. Works great on a Droid X.  We have paid the monthly fee so we don't get commercialsâ€_ Thatâ€™s the way to go if you listen to Pandora for any length of time.  It has lots of features.  Share the track you are currently listening to. Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you are listening to.  Also, an option to buy the track if you like it that much.  Also, you can touch the picture and another screen opens from behind and allows you information about the artist, features of the track and lyrics. THAT is very cool.  Allows you to create as many stations as you like.  If you don't like a song in your genre then ""thumb it down"" and it should never play again. I think what I love the most about Pandora is it plays songs LIKE the play list I create and I find new songs to love all the time."
Pandora,works well,BeckyL,29-Sep-17,5,The app works well. No complaints yet.
Pandora,EASY MUSIC,Qbee,29-Jun-16,4,This app makes it easy to listen to music and I find it very helpful:)
Pandora,Pandora Media,Ingrid,12-Mar-14,4,I turn on Pandora  from my Tablet and use a jambox for the sound via Bluetooth.. I am a subscriber and pay my monthly fee. Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart.  Sometimes it is really bad.  (I have no problems with Radio Paradise).  Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there.  Most annoying since it is not December but March.  It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars.
Pandora,Five Stars,Linda,4-Sep-17,5,Love to listen to it while cleaning.

Pandora,Well I can honestly say this is my favorite radio station and I've used it for many years,Indu,24-Mar-17,3,"Well I can honestly say this is my favorite radio station and I've used it for many years. But when you have a problem with it, it's impossible to get it fixed. My son gave me a gift card and it isn't working. I've written so many times and on one will help me. The free version sucks (ads) so you really need to pay for it. I think if you buy it from Amazon it'll be better than buying it from Pandora directly. Amazon takes care of their customers but Pandora doesn't. Next time, I will go through Amazon so they will look after me!"
Pandora,Used to be a great product.,Thomas D. Parker,20-Oct-17,3,"Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working.

Pandora,Pandora works sometimes,UG Tech,24-Apr-15,3,"I've been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it's satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I'm on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."
Pandora,Daily Music Choice,Devonia D. Russell,5-Mar-17,5,"I listen everyday via, TV, telephone or something.  Good variety and will play your choices if you rate the songs."
Pandora,Get this app!,Lizzieisawesome,14-Mar-13,5,"Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you won't regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
Pandora,No difference,myra collins,24-Oct-16,3,I don't see a replay button. The new app looks exactly the same.

Pandora,"Pandora amazes me, and I'm a vinyl and radio junkie from way back.  Don't cheat yourself; try this one!",Middle Man,22-Nov-13,5,"Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it's commercial free (if you pay the modest $36.00 US or so per year).  Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you'll get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose.  I can't recommend Pandora highly enough.  If you're tired of normal radio, try Pandora.  You'll listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love.  It's almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go!  Try it....I'd be really surprised if you don't love it.  You define your stations however you'd like.  Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
Pandora,Stations just plain missing the mark,Gene  A Vosteen,15-Aug-17,2,"Pandora is an OK service, but the ability to ""create a station"" is quite overblown.  When one creates a station with a (very) popular performer, that performer should be 50-70% (at least) of the songs played.  I often find that percentage down around 10-20%.  While I like being introduced to new artists that I might not have heard before, making them the most played is not what I am looking for.I can go to YouTube and get all the songs I want from any artist I want.That's the main reason I don't upgrade; it's not quite what I'm looking for.  Comments welcome and info about upgrade features would be interesting."
Pandora,"Great app, worth paying for no ads",Christina Babnis,19-Aug-14,5,"Pandora is the best. Years ago when I first got it for my phone, I had a tedious desk job where the only thing you did all day was do the same repetitive data entry task, and so we were allowed to wear headphones. I paid the $4 a month (at the time that was the price - I'm not sure if that's changed) to take away the ads, and man was it worth it. Best $4 a month I'd ever spent. Listening to music at this job was one of the only things there that kept me sane."
Pandora,great app,Brad,23-Jan-14,4,"I've been using Pandora for years and an always amazed by how will it chooses songs.  I made a 6 hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because you can't necessarily get the exact song you are looking for, you may have to wait a few songs for it to come up."
Pandora,Radio Service,Marian E Curley,16-Jan-13,4,"It's easy to access,  otherwise in this remote area Olympic Peninsula we have no radio service. I've been able to get all the types of music I enjoy listening to without interrupting ads or new broadcasts or sports!"
Pandora,Keep the music going!!!,Amazon Customer,18-Nov-16,5,The music on this app is incredibly great.
Pandora,"won't play, 3rd update in a row.",Troy,17-Apr-16,1,"The ads seem to load just fine, but the music plays for usually 1 second and it pauses, and hitting play doesn't work.  This is the 3rd update in a row that has done this. This was nice when it worked."

Pandora,I really enjoy the variety of music I can listen to,Judy Weimer,9-Feb-17,5,"LUV, LUV, LUV Pandora!  I really enjoy the variety of music I can listen to, depending on my mood.  Thanks, Pandora!"
Pandora,"Not a bad app, very easy to use and install",Bfield,23-Jul-14,4,"Not a bad app, very easy to use and install.  I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top 40 depending on my mood.  This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical.  Guess what? It's working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset."
Pandora,Good 2 me,Rudy A Alfonso,23-Oct-16,5,Very good to me
Pandora,Free Radio,Key_Yak_J,27-May-14,5,"Listen to PANDORA all the time, i will say sometimes the songs are repetitive, but that's why it is important to click the thumbs up or down button as you're presented songs you like and don't like.  It will start to figure out what you like and give you more thumbs up type of music :)"
Pandora,"Cool stations, from Jazz to Punk!",allen collins,20-Jul-17,5,"Great service, works well with my Tap and Dot, love to be able to say Alexis, play some soft Jazz or Daft punk, and, I'm off to great music land. Love it all!"
Pandora,"best music app out there, get Pandora one!",Von Dorken,12-Oct-15,5,"I have left several reviews for this most bad. These were while I was using the free version.  Ads cause it to buffer forever. Music was choppy. Timeouts happened often. After upgrading to Pandora one it's like a whole different app! Works flawlessly now, stations will download automatically to so even connection issues don't usually stop the music. It's so much faster now it's amazing. High quality audio works now. The selection and rating system is the best I have tried in any music app. Suggestions are usually very good. Sometimes despite constant thumbs down it keeps playing certain things but that's not too often. Browse feature in Pandora one is so good. This really is the app of your a music lover and if you really are a music lover you have to get the paid version, the difference is amazing!"
Pandora,Fantastic app,imericwhoru,22-Jun-17,5,Great app! You can set up individual radio stations for your favorite artist and Pandoras' software will follow the artist music types and play other artist that you probably never heard of. I have set up other stations from these Pandora suggestions and I am very happy with the results. The over the air radio stations are clueless on how to follow out the music types the public likes. I tracked over the air staions and they all have a 90 - 120 song rotation but Pandora is unlimited. Fantastic app.
Pandora,way Pandora adds selections that similar to every other song and each one gets better and better,Mack,26-Sep-17,5,"Unbelievable , way Pandora  adds selections that similar to every other song and each one gets better and better. I did not know there were that many artist with such talent !!!"
Pandora,personalized radio,stephanie,16-Apr-15,5,"I have been using this app for year and prefer it over all the other music/radio apps. You can create your on stations to your own personal music genre and like or dislike select songs that play randomly. The song that you have given thumbs up to starts to store on that particular station so it can play as often as you like. It's almost like creating your own CD, but, you can add more stations and add select artist to that one particular station of your choice. In my opinion this app is easy to use and plays awesome music!!!"
Pandora,A programable music station catering to what you want to hear!,Michael Wayne,9-Feb-14,5,I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I didn't know what to expect.  I was surprised to find it easy to use and it's free.  Not many bargains like this today.  You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day.  Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music.  You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song.  You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations.  Share your stations with others also.  What's not to like.
Pandora,Best thing since the iPod!,T. Sloan,30-Apr-15,5,"I have Pandora on my phone, on my Fire TV stick, and on my Kindle. I use it everywhere. I use it on my phone, when I travel, to avoid having to find a good radio station. I use it on my Fire TV stick while I'm cleaning or cooking. Using the sleep timer on my Kindle, I can play one of my ""sleeping"" stations, which helps me fall asleep quickly. This is the best thing since iPods, for me."
Pandora,Prepubescent creation at best! Do not expect Factual information,Athyssa,11-May-16,1,"I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I've come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,25-Jul-17,5,Always love Pandora
Pandora,Five Stars,Customer,15-Nov-16,5,Thank You
Pandora,Pandora,Nan,19-Jan-17,5,Wonderful music of your choosing and excellent app. And for full members you can now rewind songs if you'd like.
Pandora,*The* way to listen to music,Bullwinkle,15-Nov-16,5,An excellent selection of music from all genres interrupted only occasionally by a single short commercial message.
Pandora,Love it...it's a must-have. Kindle Fire HD (original),Batya67,23-Feb-14,5,"Easy to use, and a TON of musical genres are available. If you have the Fire HD with Dolby speakers (as I do), it offers a great listening experience. It's just like a radio station (commercials), but with music you select yourself. It's especially great if you happen to live in a rural farming town that only gets bad country music stations and Jesus radio. Yep, I'm stuck in the sticks and Pandora has probably saved my sanity. Well, whatever little I have left anyway. hahahaha"
Pandora,it's no longer Plucky-Little-Pandora,Gregory,25-Mar-14,2,"I have subscribed to Pandora since they first offered package without ads - 2006 I believe - and listened for years before that. I have enthusiastically recommended the service to dozens and dozens of friends and even mere acquaintances; I figured I was doing them a good turn.NO MORE.Today's trigger was a Bait & Switch with the re-registration. The fee was listed a $3.99/month or $36/year, but only the one option in Google Play, a single button purchase at the monthly rate = $48 year. That's .33 more expensive than the listed annual rate.This is trickery and I take such details very seriously. It conveys to me that Pandora is now 1. a system that treats me disrespectfully and 2. it is run by those many now in business, who are consumed by avarice and greed.I know that businesses exist to make money and any service to consumers is only an epiphenomena, but this wasn't always the case with Pandora. It feels like a lose and makes me sad.But I could have live with this change. I did  find great new music. There it is a far more sinister aspect Brave-New-Pandora: it is data mining all aspects of users' choice of music..............[...]Mr. Bieschke (Pandora's chief scientist) says ""We take all of these signals and look at correlations that lead us to come up with magical insights about somebody.""People's music, movie or book choices may reveal much more than commercial likes and dislikes. Certain product or cultural preferences can give glimpses into consumers' political beliefs, religious faith, sexual orientation or other intimate issues. That means many organizations now are not merely collecting details about where we go and what we buy, but are also making inferences about who we are....Out of $427.1 million in revenue in the 2013 fiscal year, advertising generated $375.2 million..............Just what, in fact is Pandora's business?It just creeps me out that my music is being used to profile me.I've uninstalled the app."
Pandora,Gives me more of what I value...,Jim Worthy,7-Sep-13,5,"If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I've listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I've got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet."
Pandora,Favorite music,Chany,6-Jan-17,5,Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I love being able to choose music I enjoy and hearing music from my favorite genres.

Pandora,Easily select the songs you like to hear often,Stephanie Karns,2-Aug-17,5,I like Pandora when there is something specific I want to listen to and know I'll hear the songs I like.
Pandora,Great!,Ciera,30-Dec-12,5,"I love that you can choose what type of music or the artist you want to hear. It will play for a long time and just in case there are no interruptions, the app will ask if you are still listening. At which point, you can choose to keep listening or stop until the next time. Furthermore, the sound is excellent. I never have any glitches, or issues that prevent me from listening. The ads in between several songs catch you off guard, but its like radio, without the characters. The ads come and go and you're back to listening to your music preference. I recommend this app to all music lovers for anytime use!"
Pandora,The leader is falling behind,"TW Brown, Author, Editor, and Reviewer",8-Jan-13,3,"When I first discovered Pandora, I absolutely  loved it. However, over time, the ""stations"" became the same songs in the same rotation. I am somebody who listens to music 10+ hours a day. It got so that I could hear the next song coming before it played. While they started off well and had a great selection...I have migrated to Spotify. You can customize your playlist, and I have found some wonderfully obscure artists there. Pandora might become to streaming music what the VHS was to home video. It was good for its time, but easily replaced."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,1-Jul-17,5,pretty good
Pandora,What i think,Amazon Customer,24-Jun-17,5,Love cuts out
Pandora,Pandora,Shirl,31-Jan-14,5,"We love this!!!  Select any music, set up multiple channels for your own person desires, set multiple channels for every style and 'LIKE' the songs being played and you get more of the same style or 'DISLIKE; and you get less of the artists or style you dislike.  Its one of the easiest things we've ever had and so much nicer than radio.  No commercials, non-stop music, and just what you want to hear. You can't get better than that!  I even link my phone to my blue tooth in the car and listen to Pandora in the car as I drive across country...MUCH better than satellite radio, every day of the week."

Pandora,My Bose has dust on it.,Penny Anast,22-Feb-13,5,"I have stack and stacks of unused cds since discovering Pandora.  I've made classical and Latin and alternative and celtic stations, just to name a few, and with a few ""like"" and ""dislike"" clicks on various pieces of music, my stations play a wonderful blend of all the things I like best.  I love the way one can add variety to any given station by suggesting different artists, composers or compositions.  Pandora has taken the hours and hours of work out of making the perfect personal blends of music for any occasion.  Highly recommend."
Pandora,Help please.,Nancy L. Hanna,21-Jun-15,5,"so ive been trying to install Pandora on my Kindle but it wont let me.

It sucks that even if you pay you still have a limited number of skips. BUT, it does have some of the best variety of music  of the streaming apps. I use it when I just need background music going. Google Play Music All-Access is a much better alternative, but you have to fork over $9.99/month for that so its not for everybody."

Pandora,Far beyond awsome!.,Steven W.,27-Sep-15,5,Pandora is far beyond awsome. Millions of songs and genres to choose from. May not offer unlimited skips but there's ways around it. Also price wise for yearly plans. Spotify is $119.98 a year and $9.99 a month. Pandora is $4.99 a month. Yearly is $60. Huge difference on price.

Pandora,Great Product,DAVE T,17-Jan-13,5,I always listen to music thru Pandora and will continue to do so. I would not mind a feature that would let me repeat a song I would like to hear over again.
Pandora,Awsome...wife loves this!,Robert J. Wagner,14-Apr-14,5,I am one of the first subscribers of Sirius satellite radio (within the first year of it starting).  Pandora is probably going to be my new paid service.  I can play and listen to pretty much everything I want too.  Sirius has kind of become just like the free radio stations.  If and when Howard Stern leaves I will probably get rid of my subscription but even then Howard seems like he is just phoning in his show so I am really thinking about cancelling my subscription with Sirius and going with Pandora.
Pandora,Selection of music is good. But way,A. Bennett,19-Jun-17,2,"Selection of music is good. But way, way, way too many ads on the free service. I'd rather just choose an FM radio station that plays music I like. Very disappointing."
Pandora,I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated,Mary Magoon,7-Sep-17,1,This app is not what it claims to be. I put in what I liked and it gave me songs I hated. Have tried several times and it is a waste of money.

Pandora,Worst,Greg Golson,25-Sep-16,1,"This is by far the worst music app I have ever used.I keep trying it to see if it gets any better, but no it only gatsby worse every time I try it. I tried it on my computer years ago and it did okay but eventually it just got to where it did not work.This time it worked and then skipped half of each song. Will not be trying Pandora ever again."

Pandora,Excessive permissions and poor app performance made me remove it from my Kindle Fire!,JJCEO,7-Jul-12,1,"I thought it would be nice to listen to the radio when I was waiting for someone when I had a WIFI available. I didn't realize that I had to sell my soul to do so! This app bombarded me with ads and forces you to sign in with your email address just to use it. They want to get you to buy the paid version, and it has limited options to listen to your preferred artist. It also clips the ends of many songs which I hate.The permissions list for this app is just crazy. Why should a radio app gain access to my personal data, modify my calendar and send email to guests and read my contact data. That is exceptionally invasive and I don't want to share that data with someone's server.Here is a list of the permissions on my Amazon Kindle.* Network communication - full internet access and create Bluetooth connections* Your personal information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests, read contact data* Storage - modify delete internal storage contents* Kindle calls - read Kindle state and identity* System tools - Bluetooth administration, change WIFI state prevent kindle from sleeping* Network communication - view network state, view WIFI state* System tools - automatically set start at bootI just found the app to not work very well, not have the controls I wanted and its invasion of my data was over the top of what I thought was necessary to listen to the radio. I have deleted it from my Kindle Fire."

You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $36 yearly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""  That's why I use Milk Music. You pay less only $4.00 per month and you'll get unlimited Skips with no Ads.  I think I'm going to say with Milk Music."

Pandora,Type in your favorite artist and go WIRELESS RADIO on your phone/tablet; HAVE AN ENTIRE LIBRARY OF RADIO STATIONS!.,Barbara Mowrey BM,30-Jan-14,5,"You will spend a lot of ""data"" using Pandora if you are away from home/wireless. Always good to buy songs from Amazon and download to your phone as I do. Find those songs on Pandora/Wifi  while free, and you can buy them very cheap on Amazon... here. A new song a month;.50 cents? something to look forward too. Save your songs on your phone; Then put on the head phones at home or at the doctors office or walking, and read the Bible or the LA Times or new books like author ""Chris Perez, ""To Selena with Love"" ! Its free after download; no use of data! You saved it on your phone! It's yours!"

Pandora,Five Stars,Victor Hart,4-Apr-17,5,Like it
Pandora,The longer you have it the better it gets,Sweet potato,14-Mar-14,5,"I like a very wide range of music including country, Motown, jazz, Native American flute, show tunes, hip hop, and classical. I can only get that variety on Pandora. I have been tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down button to the songs pandora chooses for me ever since I downloaded it to my shiny new iPad 1 - was that 6 years ago? The result is I have the perfect radio station for my eclectic taste of music. No where else can I hear the smooth jazz fusion of Hiroshima followed by a sound track from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. Pandora goes with me on all my devices and was a factor in me purchasing my Honda CRV - it came with Pandora built in! The commercials are annoying to me because the original Pandora was commercial free. Now they break in after every 6 or 7 songs. Still less frequent than regular radio but I might have to break down and pay the $4 a month to get rid of them. Best music app hands down."
Pandora,:),m.vandyke,21-Jan-13,5,it has all ur favorite songs that u love trust me I listen to Pandora every day and if u listen to music all the time then this is for u and it is free

Pandora,What I Need,Joanna,4-Jun-16,5,"Pandora for my tablet is just what I wanted. New things I haven't heard mixed with old things I love from the same genres, plus lyrics, and adaptive playlists. Love it!"
Pandora,Five Stars,ERIC,1-Apr-17,5,thank you
Pandora,Enough of the elevator music,David L Hickey,2-Sep-17,1,"The ads are way louder than the music. The music times out too soon. I like to set it for long periods. The stations' music selections are too commercial and repetitive. I listen to classical, so why do I have to keep hearing Vivaldi's "" the seasons"" every day? How about some in depth recordings of certain composers on different days?"
Pandora,What a Find!,Gaye Goodman,22-Aug-14,4,"I am a ""senior citizen"" and new to the idea of sampling music online. My tastes range from Portuguese fado and neo tango music to Brian Eno & Harry Partch. In one week of happily skipping about Pandora, I have only found ONE composer they could not locate.I'm not wild about the occasional car ads, but that is a small price to pay for the pleasure and education Pandora has afforded me. Three cheers for this new-fangled technology, which is also intuitive and easy to use!"
Pandora,Great app loved it but theres  just one thing.....read on,mary reinemer,23-Jan-14,4,I love this app. There is only one thing that is really  makes me mad is that sometimes it plays artists I didn't download. But just get it it's really good but just that one thing I'm not trying to make you not buy it.
Pandora,"""I love my Pandora""",Jeremy D Waters,29-Dec-14,5,"""I love my Pandora!"" Radio will never be the same for me. I actually have thought of getting the Ad-Free Pandora One, but am not ready to pay $4.99 a month yet. I'm such a cheapskate. I probably will once I get more gadgets that will allow me to use Pandora. Once that happens it's totally worth it because your linked to your own account no matter what gadget your using at the time. Go Pandora !"
Pandora,I love it,the lion hearted.that's all,13-Feb-17,5,Perfect for my tablet...
Pandora,Your dream stations,howard,19-May-16,5,"It's free, with only three or four ads per hour. You pick an artist and it sets up a channel playing music by them or in a similar genre. What's to complain about?"
Pandora,I love Pandora!,Beverly Lynnt,7-Mar-13,5,"I love this app. You can move around on the carousel and even read books while listening to your favorite music. The only thing I don't like so far, is that I have been notified that they will charge for any amount of listening over 40 hours/mo. I don't think that is right, because I already have an account with Pandora through our Netflix account. So it should be covered already. I know it imported all my ""stations"" from that account. If you have an account with Netflix, be aware of this. It might be a new policy. I don't know."
Pandora,Five Stars,darlene ulrich,19-Apr-17,5,GREAT

Pandora,Great ap.,Evelyn,30-Sep-17,5,"How very wonderful to be able to listen to whatever kind of music you're in the mood for,whenever you want it. Love it !"
Pandora,if you like one artist go to Amazon FIRE,Leo Schools,3-May-17,1,"Don't ever sign up. They make it almost impossible for you to get out. Also you have to go back and tell them you are listening. Furthermore, if you like one artist go to Amazon FIRE, PRIME and just ask Alexa for the artist you want and that is what you get.  I doubt that Pandora will be around for long."
Pandora,AMAZING!!,puppy love,20-Mar-16,5,WOW I LOVE IT! Free music! No limits! The only thing that's bad are the ads but those only come in after like SEVEN songs and there is only one or two. You must get it if you love music. Even my daughter loves it she can listen to disney songs ALL day. It's perfect for when your trying to clean to.
Pandora,... it is grate I am 80 and it is great to listen to what I did in the 50's,RobertStockwell,12-Aug-17,5,"I think it is grate I am 80 and it is great to listen to what I did in the 50's,it is really grate"

Pandora,Beats all the others I have tried including Amazon Primes Music streamer,Davyo,11-May-16,5,Had this for a couple of years and it is far and away the best streaming music commercial free program I have tried and the only one I bought other than Amazon Primes which is far clumsier and diffcult to program and less flexible so far
Pandora,Love it !,Delano Mizrahi,26-Sep-16,5,Never tried it before...  but I actually love it. It's amazing!
Pandora,Five Stars,Nicole,28-Apr-17,5,works great
Pandora,i like it.,Amazon Customer,25-Jun-17,5,It's a chance to pick and choose music listening  that suites my tastes and memories. Great!
Pandora,Quality has gone downhill,Holly,18-Mar-15,2,"Ive had Pandora One for over a year, and it was great. I enjoyed it. I wasn't a fan that you were still limited with how many songs you could skip but I can deal.For the past three months Ive had ongoing issues with one of my stations that should be playing Today's Hits... normally it plays the newest hits that you find on the current radio and new music. Lately its been playing weird folk music. I've sent numerous emails and have gotten responses ranging from ""we're sorry"" to ""its working as expected"", well its not working as expected. I shouldn't have to thumbs down the same songs more than once on the same station... twice in a row, I shouldn't have to thumbs down it more than once ever on the same station. they seem to hope Ill just give up.My thought is if I'm paying 5 a month for something I expect you to make an effort to fix the issue. Its only one station with the issue, and I cant even delete the station and set it up again... it simply opens the old one back up.Come on Pandora, you can do better. Your service has gone downhill."
Pandora,Five Stars,Maylin,20-Nov-16,5,The music is so relaxing when I'm working around the house.
Pandora,Who doesn't love Pandora???,Becky,9-Dec-16,5,"Free radio that I get to customize?!? My only complaint is when I say I will turn it off after the next bad song, but every song is good because I chose them all!!!!"

Pandora,Cough it up,Slick Rick,2-Feb-16,5,"I like the shuffle of the music I have chosen, but not the ads for prioposim or whatever Cialis is hawking or is that because they want you to become annoyed enough to spend money for no ad listening?"

Pandora,Create your own station,Rochalle Rooks,28-Aug-14,5,"This chanel is well worth listening to.  Very little commercials and nothing but music.  You get the option to create radio stations based on the band genre you pick.  Just recently, I was listening to a station that I created, and heard new bands from the same genre.  This increase my music repertoire.  I highly recommend this application."
Pandora,Thanks Pandora!!,T. Q. Washburn,6-Aug-17,5,Nice to have MY choice of music any time and any where!  Thanks Pandora!
Pandora,very nice music listening,kimplusrick,14-Jan-16,5,Pandora Radio is very good and high quality streaming music. the sound is crisp and clear and yes there are commercials but not as many as there are on other streaming music sites so you get more hours of uninterrupted music than anywhere else. highly reccomend

Pandora,Salsa,Faura,6-Sep-17,5,"Love it.  It has variations which it let hear music from different decades in the same station,"
Pandora,"The Doctor (not really the Doctor, just a nickname)",mom_with_4,21-Nov-13,5,"I think this is absolutely the BEST music app I've ever had! It's better than I Heart Radio by a landslide! Any station you can think of, Pandora has it!! It isn't like a real broadcast radio station, but if you type in something like Today's Adults Hits, all that station plays is today's hits! If you don't have the paid version (4 dollars a month) however, it has some ads. Oh, and another thing. You will get a lot ofE-mails telling you what songs you like (they would know because there is an option of 4 buttons, one is Like, one is Dislike-automatically skips song- skip, and pause) and what new songs are for the season. I like the e-mails, however, even if you hate e-mails. Well, I don't have the paid version, and I think it's amazing! Seriously, get the app! No station limit, no anything but songs of your choice and a couple ads."
Pandora,I thought i had one i liked until i fell in love with this one!!! :),BlueSkys,4-Feb-16,5,"Love this, I did get to try at a discount for my honest review but will keep at the regular price!

Pandora,"Create a ""sound""",Thomas Ervasti,20-May-16,4,"If you're not fussy about getting the exact song you want, Pandora's good. Thumbs up the songs you like. Thumbs down the songs you don't and they won't play them again. The more you vote, the better your station gets."

Pandora,Not the best but certainly not the worst,Ramona,31-Dec-15,3,Just like most subscription services the music tends to repeat itself even with all the selections that they could match to my likes. It's a nice thing to have when I want to hear artists I am not familiar with but I prefer Google Play Music and Sirius XM.

Pandora,Meet your new favorite radio app!,Lauren,30-Jan-15,5,"Great app, I love being exposed to new music based on artists I already enjoy.

Pandora,The Best,Jack,4-May-17,5,"This is the most wonderful music channel ever. I listen at home on an internet radio, on the computer and especially in the car with a smart phone hookup.

Pandora,no other steamer like it.,doug,6-Jun-15,5,"Best one yet. I was currently a Spotify premium member for 9.99 a month. Let me tell u it sucked sure music u want on demand, but radio would keep playing tracks over and over and over again as if the DJ in my phone was drunk. Now I've switched back to Pandora. I would pay for Pandora too if it had unlimited skips."

Pandora,I really expect high quality audio for streaming.,D. Hoover,30-Jun-16,3,"I noticed Pandora used to stream 192 kbps for free with advertisement.  Now it looks like you have to pay to get that quality.  That stinks.  When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps.  Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings.  It's like paying for satellite radio.  Why would I when the quality is set so low?  Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities.  Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps.  Otherwise, I'll never pay for it.  You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free.  What's the incentive then?  None."
Pandora,the mobile app works great and functions almost exactly like the mobile and desktop ...,Alexander,1-Sep-15,5,"If you don't know what Pandora is or how it performs, I'm curious as to why you'd be attempting to download an app on a horse & buggy.

Pandora,Pandora.,norman longval,11-Feb-16,5,Love it. I buy it to avoid the ads. I'm very satisfied with Echo. The only problem I have is how echo doesn't hear me when music is playing. It has to be turned down low and then it can hear me. But that's a minor problem that I can live with.
Pandora,Great App with the ease of use and sound quality you want,TJ-STL,12-Dec-13,5,"Love it. It works even better than the one on my PC.  The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax. WELL WORK LOADING."

On every device I own with the original account. Just wish that they had an option to play mp4 as well as mp3. Like Pandoras BOX. Haha. How's about it dev?"
Pandora,GREAT!!!,GV,24-Mar-15,5,"Pandora is nice, had it a while back then switched to Spotify for a while and now switched back, Pandora suites me just as well, and its FREE!"
Pandora,A Station for everyone,Dawn,31-Aug-17,5,Love being able to hear my favorite artists and then get new ones of the same genre. Multiple stations for multiple moods. They even have a special station for your petsâ˜º
Pandora,Just downloaded this app and trying it for the first time,Beautiful lana,10-Feb-17,4,Don't know if its going to be good but my grandma had it for awhile and is able to download any music she wants so this might be better then any other music app I had. I just don't want to pay for anything lmao
Pandora,Five Stars,Morgan Rae,23-May-16,5,"plays just what I'm wanting to hear, but don't know all the artist...;-) to make the just right station"
Pandora,I love this app,Janet L Shupp,10-May-15,5,This i believe is my favorite app ever! The music selections are great and sound quality is awesome! I have selected about 25 of my favorite artists and with each artist you get other artists that compliment each other. And the shuffle option means i can listen all day and only hear my favorite performers!
Pandora,Gotta Luv It!! Pandora: A Critical Review,Andre Lawrence,22-Jun-12,5,"This is by far one of the best mobile app's out there.I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist.  Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay.  Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else.  I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.Pandora radio for mobile.  5 stars."
Pandora,Pandora,Gem,31-Jul-17,5,Hubby loves his music and Pandora is the best.
Pandora,Great muaic all the time.,healthy momma,31-Jan-17,5,Love Pandora.  I can listen to anything I want to and mix it up.  Some days I listen to piano and classical.  Other days I listen to pop or retro plus many more stations.
Pandora,Absolutely LOVE Pandora!,TrishaD,11-Nov-15,5,Absolutely LOVE Pandora!! One of my absolute favorite ways to listen to music. You pick your song and it just seems to know what you want to listen to. It's super user friendly and spot on with my selections. Very pleased with this app. I have a Galaxy S6.
Pandora,REALLY like it!,RWingo,8-Dec-15,5,"Really like the categories and source selection opportunities. The only thing I don't care too much for is you are limited to skipping ahead or 'thumbs down'. Once I figured it out, I just used another category to fine tune my selections. Great for traveling!"
Pandora,Great radio,Louie9663,19-Sep-17,5,Works great . Plays lots of music songs you know .
Pandora,Requested Personal Information,Amazon Customer,21-Nov-14,3,"I did not download Pandora onto my Kindle when I was asked to give personal information. My nephew explained to me that Pandora wanted that information so they could have commercials that are interesting to a person with my profile. Since I am not a big fan of commercials and I can listen to Amazon Prime Music commercial free, why would I download it."
Pandora,I love their service,B. Clark,25-Apr-15,5,"Pandora has helped me learn about and share new music for years, now. I love their service. I use it all the time. Their radio feature throws less curveballs than the other services I've tried. One of the other services kept trying to get me to listen to Kanye on my Taylor Swift station. I'm not even kidding."
Pandora,highly recommend,Tirado Family,6-Jan-15,5,"For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can't get enough of it. The ads don't really bug me. They're reasonable in length and I find them more tolerable than the raunchy television commercials."
Pandora,"I didnt use it because of the quality when your not subscribed, works amazing though",Mal Nushi,12-Sep-13,5,"I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
Pandora,Love Pandora!,RENport AL,5-Jul-15,4,"We use Pandora all the time and have for years. Fantastic music service, creates play lists based on a favorite song, artist, genre. You can improve listening experience by personalizing tastes with ""likes"" and ""don't likes."" Would give 5 stars back before there were ads! :-)"
Pandora,Five Stars,John Holt,4-Aug-17,5,"Great app, one of the best sites around."
Pandora,Pandora is justmy kind of listening.,Kaaren Arndt,13-Nov-14,5,Pandora is perfect listening tuned to what I like in music. There is music for every genre that I can customize for whatever mood I'm into for the moment.  It's nice to be able to listen to music when you're away from home. You can bring a little comfort into a motel and relax and listen to music you like and it's always good.Pandora is a great station.
Pandora,Pandora doesn't play on my device,Yoda314,10-Apr-16,2,Right now it is stuck on buffering whenever I open the app.  I tried reinstalling but that didn't work either.  Please fix this or let me know what I can do.  Thanks.
Pandora,If you dont have Pandora you're missing out.,Jamie Harrison,31-Jul-17,5,Pandora is by far the best music app out there.  It has music that none if the other apps do. My favorite is hair bands. I love Pandora!
Pandora,Indispensable semi-passive music listening tool!,Thomas T.,8-Sep-17,5,"Pandora is a great concept, and nicely executed. I learned how to use it and am now addicted! I really like the idea of encountering random tracks that fit into a self-created 'station' idea that I didn't choose directly. I'm still learning how to use its management capabilities, but I've come to use it quite a lot, as over the air radio in non-urban areas (heck, even in urban areas!) leaves a lot to be desired these days. Try it, learn it, you'll love it!"
Pandora,Pandora Radio,Mack 46,24-Jul-17,4,Didn't like all the commercials.. but other then that its awesome...
Pandora,"Okay, lack of selection and limited skipping makes this not very useful",Mook Merkin,18-Apr-15,3,"For my listening genres (electronic new age/relaxation/concentration), the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-)."
Pandora,Not worth getting,Amazon Customer,25-Jan-14,2,"I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently, I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
Pandora,Great way to hear new music!,Judson Roberts,22-Sep-13,4,"I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."
Pandora,Too many commercials.,Ricus Arkright,22-Dec-15,3,"While Pandora is nice, the free version plays a hundred times more ads than Spotify. Spotify also offers full minute commercials and then plays for half an hour. I do like how I can filter out explicit content, which is something I cannot do on Spotify."
Pandora,Five Stars,Rodney F.,20-Nov-16,5,It is great.
Pandora,I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from,Amazon Customer,20-Oct-17,5,"I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."
Pandora,I seriously love this,Happy,27-May-13,5,"When I was younger I would only really listen to whatever people happen to give to me, which was usually pop stuff given to me by my older sister. Now that I'm branching out more and finding my own music I find pandora to be pretty great for new suggestions. Music by people I'd never heard of before or even songs that I loved but hadn't heard in forever and didn't know or forgot the names of have been suggested to me and there's nothing quite like finding a long lost song to make your day. :)"
Pandora,Wonderful App,Von,11-Nov-17,5,Love getting my music on all devices.
Pandora,Absolutely Fabulous!,Randolph Antohara,11-Apr-12,5,Absolutely Fabulous!  I enjoy the quality of the music and my favorite artist from new age t trance and dance music.
Pandora,Great app any time,sweett588,1-Jul-17,5,Good to have on my kindle fire for quick music
Pandora,I've enjoyed Pandora very much,Belle's Mom,22-Aug-17,5,"I've enjoyed Pandora very much.  A co-worker has it on her phone, and liked what I heard.  You have a variety of choices in music to choose from.  I'm very happy with it. I have it on my Kindle."
Pandora,Are you still listening?,Benjamin J. Lee,3-May-17,2,Are you still listening? Every thirty minutes?  Really Pandora?  Every thirty minutes?  Goodbye Pandora.  Hello any other music streaming service.  Are you still listening?
Pandora,awesome possum,Stacie,11-Jan-17,5,"As a Pandora One user, I have no complaints. I use Pandora as an alarm and I they have great suggestions for radio stations and adding songs to my existing playlists."
Pandora,Five Stars,Shooker,23-Aug-17,5,useful app and works like it should
Pandora,I like Pandora and I use it on both my laptops ...,Dave Dilworth,7-Nov-14,3,I like Pandora and I use it on both my laptops so I thought it only natural to use it on my Kindle.  I was not overly impressed with the Kindle version. It only wants to show the history of the group or artist. Where is the lyrics? I like to see the lyrics sometimes and it is fun to see what they really say as opposed to what people think.... Like I do sometimes.
Pandora,great app,Shell46,14-Feb-14,5,I love that I can type in a band that I love and it finds others similar for me!  makes it alot easier to find music you enjoy and it has the thumbs up or down so that if you really like a song just hit the thumb up and it will play songs similar to its type and if you don't then it the thumbs down!  You can add as many bands to the same radio channel as you want and it will shuffle all of those bands for you.  I just love it!
Pandora,I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it,Customer 2,5-Sep-17,5,I LOVE AND CANNOT REALLY EXIST - EXAGGERATING - without it. Live in a rural community with few stations and few options.I selected my last phone because it plays Pandora so well.
Pandora,Music player,Winston Ogle,14-Jun-14,3,"I installed the app on my pc, phone and tablet at the same time.  I checked to see if they were working by playing them.  No way to turn the app off , you have to pause the playing which leaves the app running but not playing.  I got an email from Pandora wanting to know what I was doing with the app running on 3 devices. I guess they think i'am passing it around!!  Pandora offered the option to install the App on other devices.  A good little fix would be a stop button on the App.  Oh by the way I'm a paying customer!"
Pandora,Almost 5 stars - but my station gets invaded frequently with offensive music,Gabriela Mistral,12-Jul-14,4,"I love Pandora and listen to it all the time, on my computer, my Ipad and especially my Sonos system. For the latter, it is pretty seamless and the ads in the free version are not terribly intrusive. The sound quality is great, and I usually (but not always) get music I enjoy.That said, Pandora seems a bit confused about what I call my Uplifting music station. Most of the time it works great. I get my favorite kinds of music consisting of Kirtan, Irish piano riffs and some beautiful, moving classical music. But at least once a day, my happy reverie is invaded when suddenly I am bombarded with loud and offensive rap music such as Moki complete with swear words. What the @#$*&^?? I always give these a thumbs down and the specific song goes away, only to have some other piece pop its head in the following day or even immediately after! Makes me wonder what it is about my other song choices that feeds into Pandora's algorithm fooling it into picking something so off the wall. Just curious - and mildly annoyed. And yeah, it is free so I give it ALMOST 5 stars."
Pandora,Works for me,mushi,18-Feb-13,4,"I am still new to the touch screen stuff so am still learning how to touch the screen. Previous to getting the Kindle I accessed Pandora with a PC. The web browser interface has lots more flexibility. However, for use on Kindle the one-touch simpler interface is OK for listening in the back yard and around the house. As advertised the Kindle sounds great playing pandora and sounds even better with Bose headphones plugged in. My pandora lists are vocalists and instrumentals, no heavy rock or hip-hop with heavy bass."
Pandora,I play this on my cell ph. while I am running,jumptherope,1-Feb-14,4,"and/or jumping rope.I  love the music of course..but THOSE FREQUENT ADVS. are a pain.I  have to stop running..click the corner ""X"" and then it takes some time for the song to continue...sometimes I have to close the app. then re-openI know it's FREE so I do understand.The frequency of advs. DOES make me think about subscribing for $4/monthly if that means NO ADVS. EVER!But the variety of music is impressive and  again--IT'S FREE!"
Pandora,"like, not love",seriously reviewed reviews,26-Jan-15,4,"I like pandora. It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations. Only problem: it can play really cool songs, and it can play really, really bad songs that you won't know why pandora thought you'd like. Overall though, it's pretty cool."
Pandora,great,ckelly,9-May-17,5,I like this app cause it helps me sleep and i enjoy listing to the music that they provide me.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,16-Sep-17,5,I love Pandora and I wish I would have heard about it years ago.
Pandora,Great selection of music,Joe P,29-Apr-17,5,"Great selection of music. Pick your favorite artist and listen with very little interruptions. Short commercials are ok. I bought a Jam speaker and blutooth from my iPhone, working outside bring your music with you. This is a great way to listen to the music you love."
Pandora,Impressed me to tears :),Cthulhu,28-Oct-11,5,"I am happy now. Now that Pandora's free membership comes with unlimited playback I want Pandora everywhere and, thanks to this, Pandora is on my XOOM now.Pandora is elegant and flawless on Honeycomb. The screen is less cluttered than the PC version with nothing but the album cover, the thumbs up/down icons, an 'info' button that opens up artist and song info screens and the playback controls. I like that option to blank the screen while layback continues. And Pandora keeps playing while other apps are in use - tried it with the browser and a couple of games.The Android settings menu allows you to tweak a few parameters:- Play quality high/normal- Auto screen lock on/off- Auto shutdown in low memory situations- Bluetooth on/offIt's perfection (with some ads popping up).-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<"
Pandora,radio,Tammy Ayala,11-May-15,5,Great  for all your  listening  needs  very limited  commercials. .any type of music  you  can think  of.
Pandora,Enjoyable,Kindle Customer,25-Jun-17,5,I enjoy listening to my Pandora very much.
Pandora,stop wasting your time and go to spotify.,Mitchyslick,30-May-15,1,"Spotify is WORLDS better and the premium is a rip off! $4.99 a month!? It's barely worth a lifetime membership for $4.99 and the only reason I was signed up is because I accidentally tapped to close to sign up instead of no thanks on the free version and there was conveniently no ""are you sure"" screen next just went right ahead and signed me up for an auto renewing membership.  Canceling it is not as simple as one easy click.  It can be tricky to find where to cancel your membership once your signed up if your not to families with whatever device you are running it on.  I used to enjoy the free version but didn't like having no choice in what actually played after seeing what little difference the premium version makes for the price I will never be on pandora again even if the premium was free."
Pandora,Pandora App,LD Hay,2-Aug-13,5,Awesome app.  Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great.  Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best.  They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets.  Far and away the best. I definitely recommend.
Pandora,Used to be very good!,onephatguy,6-Dec-12,3,"Not sure what has happened to Pandora, but the annoying way the ads are, and the amount, are terrible.  I used to be jealous of all the people at work with Pandora when all I had was Slacker on my Windows phone.  I now have the Droid Razr Maxx HD and have Pandora, Slacker, and Iheart Radio.  I have to say I am not jealous anymore.  This is how I would rank the three apps I have listed:  1.  Slacker  2.  Iheart Radio  3.  Pandora  Luckily all these apps are free so you can try them yourself and decide which is best for you."
Pandora,"I love, love",Jacqueline Nelson,29-Apr-16,5,"I love, love, love Pandora! I use it when I teach exercise classes, when I workout, cook, clean etc. My children love the Kidzbop station and frequently have dance parties. I like that I can play it on my phone, tv, iPad etc."
Pandora,A+,Curtis @ HC3D _\!/_,10-Feb-16,5,it always on in my office love it
Pandora,"music, music, music",Displaced snowshoer in Arizona,2-Feb-14,5,"I love Pandora. It plays in the background while I do other things on my laptop or my Kindle. I can have Pandora playing on my laptop while I work in the kitchen or do household chores. You pick the artists you like, Pandora plays those and similar artists.I often hear something from an artist I never heard before, like it, and buy the CD for my collection."
Pandora,Love,drillsergeant,24-Oct-17,5,what i listen to when doing work in the yard or upstairs house work. Love it
Pandora,Horrible,Marykate Cary,19-Apr-17,1,Spotify is so much better you don't have a skip limit and there is less adds
Pandora,Pandora is a great avenue for real music (What we once had),country coni,27-Dec-14,5,"I am addicted to Pandora.  It has a wonderful assortment of old time music.  I love the Big Band, New Orleans Jazz, Boogie Woogie, 40's, 50's, as well as classical, classic Christmas was WONDERFUL, also old country(Patsy Cline and others).  Pleasestay as great as you are.  I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change."
Pandora,I like my Pandora,Suzanne Steele,13-Feb-14,5,"This is a great app that you can configure to your style. You can thumbs up, or thumbs down songs to inform them of what music that you prefer. You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle.Hope that helps."
Pandora,Five Stars,VietVet,18-Sep-17,5,Still my favorite music app.
Pandora,Five Stars,malena,16-Nov-16,5,5 stars
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,16-Aug-17,5,if you like music get this.
Pandora,Tends to get repetetive,Rich,15-Jun-14,4,"I really like Pandora, but the only complaint I have is that when you create a station, after a while the songs start to get repetitive and it is hard to keep the station fresh.  You basically have to add an artist to the station to get some fresh songs in there, but even then it gets a little stale after a while.  However, it's free and it works.  The stream does not get interrupted unless you have a really weak signal.  It's a great way to hear some new music or artists you were otherwise not familiar with."
Pandora,Five Stars,Shopper 4 quality,1-Nov-16,5,Great music
Pandora,Great app for kids - even if you do have ...,Howzatar,9-Dec-15,5,Great app for kids - even if you do have to listen to a few ads periodically for the free version.  I like that you can choose any artist or song and the app will select other songs in the same genre to compliment your choices.
Pandora,Five Stars,Cliff Henthorne,16-Nov-16,5,AA++
Pandora,Pandora is wonderful!,Charles A Carvey,23-Jan-15,5,"Pandora is wonderful! I can listen to my favorite categories of music across multiple devices easily. The free service only has advertisements every 20 minutes - much better than other audio broadcast venues! If that's still too much, they offer a subscription service which eliminates all ads. Pretty cool!"
Pandora,Does what I have always wanted to do with my music,Kindle Customer,7-Nov-12,5,"This service has been able to do what I have always wanted to do with music; create and play dynamic playlists. The parameters that they assign music allows users to create stations and focus the dynamics of the playlist as one listens.  It can focus to a such a fine degree to where I have to delete stations and re-create them just to expand the music content. I run this on PC's, media players and tablets. My music collection has been off loaded. The subscription cost is very reasonable and makes the music seamless for hours."
Pandora,Five Stars,Gary L. Bernstein,14-Aug-17,5,We really enjoy Pandora
Pandora,"Great service, but ....",John Packer,9-May-14,3,"After being a paying member I still run out of skips.  That is annoying.  I'm not sure that the like/dislike is properly done since it seems to affect multiple channels and multiple artists.The Pandora APP on the cell phone I would never use.  They insist they have access to everything.  GPS, email, contacts, etc.  Nope."
Pandora,Needed a pick me up!,Delighted in Wichita.,15-Aug-14,5,"It's AWESOME. Some of the secretary's at work would listen to Pandora on their computers. So I decided to download the app to my Kindle Fire. I needed a little pick me up the other day. I love listening to Chris Tomlin and some of the other Christian Artist's. What a blessing! I can carry the music with me from room to room, outside or in the car. That's why I've rated the app 5 stars."
Pandora,Five Stars,martin kerkstra,20-Oct-16,5,Use a lot !!
Pandora,Has everything you want in music,Maxfilo,14-Mar-15,5,If you're looking for loud quiet or everything in between Pandora  has the right sound for you.

Pandora,"love, love, love Pandora",Kyle Pedersen,4-Jun-15,5,"I grew up with radio and love the reduced advertising and great genres that can be created on Pandora.  I'm not really one to use ear buds since I'm an artist and need to be unencumbered when I'm working.  Just turn on the computer, plug in speakers and ""Bob's your uncle""!"
Pandora,Great sound but no song selection.,Wayne Michael,19-Jul-14,5,"What can I say about Pandora other than it is fabulous!  First of all, spend the money and upgrade your membership to Premium and get the CD quality and no ads.  While I do not get to play exactly what selection I want from an artist, I can select that artist.  I find that I like my CDs better when I want to listen to a particular album but this sure beats satellite and fm."

Pandora,Favorite Stations,Thomas Mikolic,1-Nov-16,5,My favorite stations are Miles Davis and Nora Jones.
Pandora,My favorite music everywhere I go.,Beholder,3-Apr-14,5,I have unlimited minutes on my  phone.  I like to use Pandora to accompany me every where I go.  I have several favorite stations and switch them to match my mood.  One thing I really like is I can set a timer to turn it off whenever I want to use it to serenade me before I go to sleep.  I can also wake to music if I so choose.  I also use it on my computer but not as often as I do on my phone.
Pandora,Five Stars,McClellan,21-Oct-16,5,Very nice. Use it all the time.Thank you.
Pandora,it's ok,donkey Kong,7-Apr-13,2,This app only allows you to listen to music 40 hours a month a some people like to listen to music a lot and it suck that it allows 40 hours of listening to music it makes me feel like a kid like I'm time on the amount of music I listen to
Pandora,My go to,C,1-May-17,5,Love how I can look for one artist and Pandora finds comparable music to listen to!  My go to at work for sure.
Pandora,Five Stars,Mimi Ann,24-Jul-17,5,Awesome mix of music......
Pandora,Great to use on my Kindle,Mary Wiley,14-Feb-14,4,"I do love Pandora but do have an issue with them. I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa (you get my drift..) so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I'm being picky but it does get annoying when 4+ times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."

Pandora,Make it your own,Lenier Naquin,1-Nov-17,4,"I am so very addicted to Pandora. I only sometimes wish there were a few more skips allowed, but still a great thing all around ! I recommend thumbprint radio !"
Pandora,Customer Services is NOT helpful,K. Smarsh,19-Aug-17,1,Without my knowledge or permission my free Pandora was switched to Pandora Premium Trial. I requested assistance but their response is I have to return to the entity where I requested the trial. There is no way I can do what they demand since I did not request a trial.
Pandora,Where can I find my jazz -Pandora,vieille_ame58,2-Apr-14,5,"I love jazz and cannot tolerate rap and hip hop. Pandora has every genre of music from country to opera. I listen to John Coltrane, Michael Buble and an ocassional Fleetwood Mac and Elton John if I feel like it. The ads are a little troublesome but I don't mind because I get to hear the channels I chose.If you don't want the ads you can upgrade to Pandora One for an extra few bucks."
Pandora,It's okay,Bbymelii,26-Sep-17,3,"I don't really use pandora anymore,they play old music."
Pandora,Five Stars,hapihakr,5-Jul-17,5,Great streaming music app!
Pandora,Pandora - Great Streaming Music App,N. Mehta,6-Mar-16,5,"Great App to stream music tuned just for you.  You can set-up channels just to your mode or taste and filter down to the type of music you like.  Probably a 4.5 star.  Would be a 5 without the ads, but you they have to pay for the music and make money too."

I have it on my Android Phone and I can't like, dislike, skip songs, or do anything without the app eventually freaking out and playing up to 4 songs at once before it finally lets me quit the app and relaunch it. But the Pandora App on my Kindle Fire HD is great. I can skip songs, like, dislike, etc. without worrying about it freaking out on me."

Pandora,Great Music,JAL,4-Jul-13,5,My first time trying Pandora and I have to say I enjoy it very much.The ease in selecting different genres is very pleasing. the music selection is very current
Pandora,Not for me..,Gerri Hayes,18-Dec-13,2,I do not care for this one.I do not even understand why I would want to put all of my information online for someone else to see  and have not control over who sees it. I guess I am too private for this app. I believe it came with the Kindle as maybe some of the others on here for me to review that I do not remember downloading at all...I thank Amazon for the Free apps of the day!!!
Pandora,Marvelous app. Easy to use.,Dandelion,8-Jan-16,5,Marvelous selection of music for every music taste. We find a lot of composers and albums we did not know about and have purchased some of their music. Can be switched from one music type to another easily.

Pandora,pandora music app is great,BevFredette,8-Sep-13,5,"This app is NOW great!  The first time I got this app I could not get it to workwell at all. I could get a few songs to play and then it froze up. All I had wasa blue Pandora screen. I deleted the app for 3 days. Today I loaded Pandora appagain. Now it works perfectly the way I want, alot of music that I love made upinto stations that I can play any time. Plays on my Kindle Fire HD in the back-ground as I do other web searches,etc.  Wow this is great."
Pandora,"As a classical musician, it rocks.",tttiger,7-Apr-14,5,"I really did not think it would follow my tastes, as the first artist I entered was lutenist Nigel North. Lovely, I was transported to the  world of early music for a full afternoon while I painted from my Kindle. It has nicely followed my next entry, composer Nikolai Korsakov. Not a problem. Another afternoon of Russian romantic music, orchestral. How did I live without this?"
Pandora,Pandora Music service is Great!,Timothy J. Gorman,28-Jul-17,5,Always great to have so many musical choices from Pandora.  Easy to use.

Pandora,Keeps the music playing,Amazon Customer,27-Sep-13,4,"I first started using Pandora on my laptop.  Having it loaded on my Android smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD is even better.  Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous.  The user interface is good and easy to figure out.  The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately.  For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations.  But other than that, it works like a charm.  I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music."
Pandora,A definite must if you like listening to music but limited number of songs.,Steelbicyclist,3-Sep-15,4,"I love Pandora. I listen to lots of different music, especially latin salsa, bachata, merengue.  I would give it a 5 except that in each venue, the list of music is limited.  You keep hearing the same songs over and over.  Pandora really needs to offer more songs."
Pandora,Enjoy,Jerry Meeks,7-Mar-14,4,Really like Pandora - have stored on smartphone - especially like custom stations  Only problem when connected to car phone and using Bluetooth am unable to access what is playing and the indicate favorite or not unless disconnect from car radio - most difficult to do while driving which is why have in 1st place.  Even ads are not disruptive but this lack of control cause to NOT rate a 5

I love the ability to have customizable music by genres.  This was especially a wonderful app during Christmas when I could THUMBS UP or THUMBS DOWN any Christmas selection I liked or disliked.  When Christmas rolls around again, Christmas station will be even better.  I love a variety of music and Pandora IS the app for music lovers."

Pandora,Love it!,pmeda,31-Jan-14,5,"I drive an activities bus for the school district and the majority of the buses are retired route buses with broken, or more often, no radios. Pandora let's me use my Kindle, Iphone, and ipod to instantly stream the music I want to hear by my favorite artist. I often stream it on my ipod at home while I'm cleaning around the house. No more blaring stereo to hear your tunes around the house!!"
Pandora,Lovin' Pandora,Kindle Customer,4-Sep-15,5,"Not a day goes by that I don't play my favorite artists on Pandora.

Pandora,I like Pandora. Use it everyday,Michelle Thornton,8-Oct-14,3,"I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."

Pandora,great for a few years,Nimbi,28-Oct-17,1,"installed Pandora app for Kendle a few years ago.  worked great until a few weeks ago.  Now says it can't connect to Pandora.  Tried uninstall.  This moved the defective program to the cloud.  Told it to reinstall, so it recovered the defective program from the cloud, and it still doesn't work.  can't find a way to delete from the cloud and install a fresh (working) copy."
Pandora,I love Pandora the music is great you can have more ...,Amazon Customer,21-Nov-16,4,I love Pandora the music is great you can have more than one station. You have made this station affordable for people who can't afford to pay for a station thanks
Pandora,Not bad for free.,Marq Kensworth,22-Mar-14,3,"I like Pandora because it seems to be a ""smarter"" program than most. When I type in an artists it does a pretty good job of giving me things I would/could like. The downsides are that it doesn't seem to reach out into the realm of eccentricity and expose me to new artists as much as I would like AND you can't choose specific songs to listen to or build stations from."
Pandora,All kinds of music,Preum,27-Aug-13,5,"Have used Pandora both on PC, Laptop and now Fire. Splendid sound from the Fire; just keeps me either relaxing or rock and roll while working in the home."
Pandora,Love the amount of songs available in all music genres,Cynthia Roldan,24-May-16,4,Love the amount of songs available in all music genres.Hate that it takes forever to yea or nae your favorite songswhile setting up your favorite station.
Pandora,Great for Discovery,Eliazar N.,3-Oct-15,4,"Overall, Pandora has a seemingly infinite array of music available for playing and I love to discover new music and artists that I might like. I really find the fine-tuning feature helpful because it allows you to obtain a more specific music taste. Thanks to Pandora, I now regularly listen to Melanie Martinez, Marina and The Diamonds, Lana del Rey, and many other amazing artists I'd never think I'd discover. It's a great app for those who wish to expand their personal music library."
Pandora,Play lists based on popularity rather than your personal taste.,Amazon Customer,10-Aug-17,1,"Pandora sucks. Set up a ""station"" based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can't stand (guns and roses, ac-dc) because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless."
Pandora,Portable Pandora!,Palmyrita,12-Feb-16,5,"Always loved Pandora on my desktop - so glad to not be tied down to one location. Love bringing Pandora from room to room or out on vacation, where I'm not familiar with the local radio stations."
Pandora,Pandora,Donna Ohl,29-Dec-13,4,"I do like it, but am having some trouble navigating it.  For one thing I can't figure out how to turn it off without turning off the whole Kindle.  I absolutely wish Amazon would include at least SOME instruction pamphlet with the Kindle other than how to turn it on, how to charge it and how to ""swipe.""  I do not have a smart phone or IPad, so have to really learn how to navigate this device, and it's not as easy as some would have you believe!"
Pandora,not a big fan,patrick w,25-Mar-16,3,in this day and age I don't really like some one or (something) choosing my music for me  then turning off after inactivity hit me with comercials  no thanks its Spotify for me

Pandora,Five Stars,Leslie Woods-Hulse,18-Jul-17,5,thank you
Pandora,Pandora,Pamela,10-Jun-14,4,I think it is wonderful to be able to access so many different types of music and even get a little background on the groups and see lyrics.  The only thing that's needed to make this 5 stars would be more relevant music choices when you choose an artist.  As an example I chose Beach Boys and the subsequent music will be a different style from the 50's.
Pandora,Pandora,DAA,20-May-16,5,Love being able to a wide range of music any time I am in the mood.
Pandora,Great App with an Annoying Flaw,Dana L.,22-Jul-15,4,"The app is fantastic. I love listening to music when I'm driving or working; however, it is very buggy. I have yet to listen to the app for a solid hour without issues. Usually, it just needs restarted, so it's not a serious problem, but it does get annoying."
Pandora,"After trying their ""60 day free trial, "" I ...",G. Rosner,4-Mar-16,1,"After trying their ""60 day free trial,"" I wanted to keep their paid service but was not able to.  They took my credit card information and it was my understanding that I would automatically continue to receive the premium version.  However, I went back to the free version and I was not even able to go on their website and activate the premium version.  I sent several emails to them and no-one resolved it or even attempted to see what happened.  In other words, they had a someone who wanted to be their customer but couldn't and still can't!""  Not the way to run a business."
Pandora,Love it!,Amazon customer,12-Nov-16,5,I love using Pandora!!!! Love hearing the music I choose!!!
Pandora,The Source for unlimited Choice,Dakotalucky,2-Dec-12,5,"Pandora is my go-to source for any artist or song that I want to listen to. In addition, you create radio presets/stations for your favorite artist, group, genera of music even comedian. each time you sign in, you can listen to your stations or create new ones. The possibilities are endless.  Its free with some ads or you can subscribe for a low monthly fee of $3.99 month or 36.00 a year.give it a try, Im sure that you will find your favorite song, artist or comedian."
Pandora,Ya Have To Get It!!,great game! gets you to try to reach back into your brain and remember the logo's name!,21-Oct-13,5,"Pandora is the only app that I can be on for more than 2 hours!!! I love how you are able to communicate with people with the same interests as you, plus leave comments on your fave songs!! It plays all my favorite music!!! Nothing bad to report, just that leaving comments on other people's profiles might not go through... so beware!!! But other than that, best app ive ever had!!!! - Directioner4eva"
Pandora,Five Stars,June Ambs,19-Jul-17,5,wonderful music
Pandora,"Good site, but app contains a virus!",Remiel,7-Jan-15,1,"I love Pandora. The site, anyway. I can listen to almost anything I want there, and on the site, there's nothing that threatens my computer. The app, on the other hand, is highly invasive and has a virus on a file. I will keep using the site, but I'll be looking for another app for my Kindle."
Pandora,"G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T!I!T!... GET IT!!!",jeck,8-Sep-13,5,"Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay $4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and doesn't have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."
Pandora,Great application,Tweetie Bird,26-Jun-15,5,I really like having music on my Kindle.  It is only draw back is when you don't know the internet connection.
Pandora,Good,P Swanson,10-Oct-17,5,Good
Pandora,Personalized Radio,Sandy Weaver,16-Mar-14,5,"Pandora makes it easy to find new music.  Based on my requests, Pandora plays a similar selection of recommendations just for me.  I like having the choice to give a new song a ""thumbs up or down"".  If I don't like the music, Pandora stops and moves on to the next recommendation.  This is great!  I have discovered and bought more music in the last year thanks to their recommendations."

Pandora,Five Stars,george's,4-Sep-17,5,Very good! station I can create for my listening experience
Pandora,Wonderful as usual,Zoe J Eckblad,18-Oct-13,4,The new version of Pandora for Kindle Fire has many nice features like a sleep timer and an option to ask to temporarily not hear a tune you are tired of.I do wish it didn't require so many steps to exit the application and the mini-items to click are difficult for my visually impaired husband to see.Otherwise it is as wonderful as ever.  I definitely recommend the cheep annual subscription to avoid the commercials and have extended play for hours.
Pandora,I love Pandora,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-13,5,I love Pandora and all the stations I'm able to have at my fingertips anywhere! I have to have my music when I'm doing something. I love that I can listen to it on my Kindle fire HD and move it from room to room with ease and it sound great. Before I could only listen to it only at certain times and hauling my laptop from room to room was frustrating. Pandora is great and I tell people about it whenever I have the opportunity plus I'm content with the free version. The ads aren't any trouble for me.
Pandora,Five Stars,Gold Dude,19-Sep-17,5,Always a joy. Just put it on a mix and let it go for hours.
Pandora,Is a great music app,JapaneseRetardCat,5-Sep-15,4,"Is a great music app, and I love that it has international artists as well. Just sometimes I don't really care so much for the selections chosen for you when you create a station around a certain artist, as sometimes I don't want to hear someone else."
Pandora,Great Music App,B. Swenson,9-Dec-16,5,I am really enjoying Pandora on my Samsung Galaxy. A lot of great music and very few commercials.
Pandora,Five Stars,richard m leech,19-Nov-16,5,Love it
Pandora,Love the variety of this app!,poodle,26-Mar-13,5,"Simply love this app. Am able to create stations based on my interests! I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals (contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia & Phantom), classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! Doesn't matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD."
Pandora,Great music app!,Kristina Hernandez,30-Nov-15,4,"Pandora is a great way to listen to so many different genres of music. I really enjoy listening to a specific channel based on an artist and the other music that is mixed with it are very similar. Overall, it is a great app and I would certainly recommend it to my family and friends. The one thing I do not like is how it goes idle after a period of time. I suppose that is a way of ""saving battery power"" or something like that, so it's not too big of a problem."
Pandora,Three Stars,Jo,22-Jul-17,3,"When it works, it's okay. Not enough skips unless you pay for the month/year (~7)."
Pandora,... been listening to Pandora for years they have a great selection of genre and we can rate the music ...,Judy Murray,4-Sep-17,5,I've been listening to Pandora for years they have a great selection of genre and we can rate the music as it is played.  Thank you Amazon for having Pandora available and for free
Pandora,Five Stars,peggy jones,23-Aug-17,5,"I love Pandora, it's great to be able to listen to my favorite music at any time.I  lo"
Pandora,Awesome Music!,Gina Davis,17-Sep-13,5,I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!
Pandora,Service Please,RedStarGalalxy,29-Mar-17,1,"Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"
Pandora,but I don't like my songs being cut off or my commercials in ...,figuresix,26-Jan-17,4,"It's a free app, but I don't like my songs being cut off or my commercials in Spanish.I love the choices Pandora pics for me. I have found some new groups I love."
Pandora,Love it!,B. Kunz-Meaker,10-Nov-12,5,"There is nothing more enjoyable than being able to type in the name of an artist or music genre, thensit back and listen. If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down""icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simplyclick and select a new one."
Pandora,Best way to find new music,picky!!!,25-May-14,5,"Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense."
Pandora,Works great.,phxray,29-Apr-17,5,Works on my Kindle
Pandora,Pandora At Last,Zelda Martin,8-May-14,5,This app is so wonderful! I love being able to hear the music and comedy routines that I love without buying anything and without putting up with a D.J. It is just the music I love. I have my oldies and the most current.The only problem I am having is the wake up to music feature. I may not understand it yet.  I just got an alarm with no music.
Pandora,Love it!,Amazon Customer,9-May-17,5,I've always loved Pandora! Love how they can figure out our tastes and especially now that we can skip back to the previous song! :)

Pandora,Pandora,Bob Church,23-Jan-14,4,A great app for music.  The ability to create stations by either choosing an artist or music genre makes for great listening.  You here only the types of artists you wish to hear.
Pandora,What I enjoy in the evening with dinner.,Kindle Customer,14-Jan-15,5,I listen to Pandora daily when my wife and I are having dinner. I like the thumbs up or thumbs down feature because when I give it thumbs up I get more of that sort of music. When I give it a thumbs down the music goes off immediately. I also like the wide variety of music available.

Pandora,We like it.,E. Ervin,22-Jun-15,5,"My much beloved spouse likes Pandora very much. He uses it a lot and is quite pleased with it. If he is pleased, then I am delighted. Very very nice."
Pandora,I love it,Jason S.,14-Mar-14,5,"I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want."
Pandora,Pandora,Wee Willie,11-Aug-13,5,"I love Pandora.  I have to say I like it better than any other music source.  One can 'make' a radio station and listen to just the music you want.  Anything you don't like, give it a thumbs down and you don't hear it again.  After a period of time, it's all the stuff one likes to hear.  Did I say I love it?  Also have it on all 4 computers as well as my cell phone.  It don't get any better.  Life is good!"

Pandora,Nice good sounds !,Amazon Customer,19-Jul-17,4,"Nice to be able to hear some of the old songs again, most of the radio stations don't really play 'oldies but goodies! Clue. It's not 1990's !"

Pandora,Goodbye Pandora music....I am now a Slacker!,Sonja A Vallillo,16-Jul-16,3,Pandora streaming is off-line and I have become a Slacker fan...Pandora streaming to multiple AV receivers has stopped for the past +30-days and Pandora is very slow to resolve this issue like past ones.  Not able to listen to Pandora on  such receivers so I now found Slacker Radio and use it via the iPod connection.  Music selection with minimal 30-second commercials is free and finding better music selection/rotation than my paid Pandora music subscription. I have become a Slacker and goodbye to Pandora!
Pandora,Easy to install and use on Echo,marblehead,6-Sep-17,4,Easy to install and use on Echo. Does not have every song I like so far but just started using it so still working on it.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon CustomerJWAC929,15-Jul-17,5,I LOVE IT LIKE SPOTIFY.
Pandora,If you like music here it is.,Coolbob425,30-Jan-13,5,"Pandora allow you to somewhat pick the music that you like.  Somewhat being that if you like a song and indicate as a thumbs up you will get more of the style of music.  You don't really get to pick the music you pick the style or similar music.  If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like.  Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music.  It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it)  It is worth the download.  Try it"
Pandora,pandora,Swadog,31-Mar-12,5,I think Pandora is a great app because wen u want to listen to good music its there. I say u should get this app.
Pandora,Amazing!,butterfly,20-Jan-14,5,"It never ceases to amaze me as to how this little Kindle can actually get great music for me, all at the touch of a button!  The Kindle enables me to do such fun things, but I especially love being able to carry music with me into any room of my house.  The selections played are wonderful, and is just another reason I'm so glad I purchased a Kindle.  Pandora is simply amazing and such fun to use!"
Pandora,"Great, but.......",Anna Elizabeth Thomas,27-May-15,3,"Pandora is a great music player and I really enjoy using it. But I found out you need WiFi to use. If you know of a music player you can download on a kindle fire that doesn't need WiFi, plz contact me on Pintrest (Anna Thomas) or on Kik (Peppermentstick). Thank you. :)"
Pandora,Still my favorite Internet Radio,Amazon Customer,22-Sep-13,5,"Sure Spotify and Rdio have the social element but music is more personal for me and I'll admit, I am not too involved in socialnetworks. Pandora constantly adjusts and updates music and while it can take a while to curate your station, I still get a random mix of songs I like. I rather like the genre and atmosphere, depending on my mood or what I am doing as opposed to selecting artists."
Pandora,Loved it but had limited Gs so could not play it much.,Anonymous Me,29-Aug-17,5,"Loved it but at the time, I had limited Gs so could not play it much.  Now I have Slacker, not as good but it will do."
Pandora,Pandora is awesome.,Gary Smith,26-Nov-12,5,"In the area I live, finding a good Contemporary Christian radio station can be difficult. Everything is either a little too country or a little too pop sounding. What I like most about Pandora is that I can tailor it to my taste and don't have to sit through a few songs I don't particularly like to hear one I do like. And I really enjoy that I can create a few different stations to go with the mood I am in on any given day. And if I really love a song I hear it is easy to purchase. I would rate Pandora more stars if possible."
Pandora,Great music - few commercials!,Sharon,31-Jan-14,5,"One of the best qualities about Pandora is that they play other music in the genre you've chosen, and this exposes the listener to music they might never have heard or been familiar with.  The other bonus is being able to listen to a certain type of music on demand and then switch to totally different kind when the mood strikes.  I have at least 5 ""options"" I choose from.  Plus, my children can have their own ""stations"" when they are on the computer."
Pandora,Pandora Review,LK,29-Apr-14,5,"I recently was given a Kindle Fire for my birthday and it had Pandora already loaded on it. Since January, I have been listening to so much GREAT music. I can personalize it many ways according to mood, time of day, etc. The selections that come forth are brilliant and I love the notion of having music at my fingertips whenever I want. Well done, Pandora!!"
Pandora,Four Stars,David Lockhart,2-May-17,4,"Pandora is a good application, I would recommend this application to anyone who enjoys listening to music."
Pandora,Great.,Niecie,31-Oct-16,5,Great.
Pandora,Glitch?,Reg,7-Aug-15,1,"I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up (not playing them) they just pop-up and don't stop until I close the app. I don't know if it's just my kindle or the app."
Pandora,Good for background music,QueenB,8-Jun-13,4,"I have Pandora on my Kindle Fire and I use it as background music when I am entertaining so I don't have to figure out what music to play. So far I have only 1 station - cool jazz. I used the thumbs up, thumbs down option and I plan to do more with Pandora when I have more time. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle or Pandora -- after the music has been playing for a while the screen goes black and I can't change anything any more. The music keeps playing for a while and eventually if you don't tell it anything it stops because it thinks you're not listening anymore."
Pandora,Satisfaction with Pandora,Amazon Customer,27-Aug-13,5,"I LOVE Pandora............have it on my phones, TV, Computer etc.  I love the option to download and specify certain artists and songs..........creating my own playlist if you will."
Pandora,Wonderful App,Nancy E. Wall,10-Mar-14,5,"I have discovered so many great new artist using this program and my appreciation for music has grown!  Plus, it's not just music.  There are multiple comedy channels you can discover and that's all my husband and I listen to on long car drives.  We love it and I definitely recommend it to any one with a tablet, computer, smart phone, etc.  You wont regret it!  It is my favorite app!"

Pandora,Love Pandora!!!!,sallyz,3-Nov-12,5,"Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears.  Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
Pandora,Absolutely Amazing!,eric ochoa,16-Apr-14,5,"If you love music this is YOUR app! First, the app is free and so is the music! If your into singers like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato it gives it you! Or if you like rock bands like Metallica or Nirvana they have it too! All you have to do is search the band/singer name and it will come up. And also if it's your favorite song, you can like it and it will play at times. I love this app and so will you!"
Pandora,Love it,Houston Johnson,25-Feb-16,5,"My math teacher puts on pandora during a test and I asked if it would work on my kindle and yet it did so now I use it almost everywhere I go such as shower, before bed, while I'm reading etc.Just one of the best music apps I've ever had"

Pandora,make an account?,BASCHMAN,15-May-15,1,"Marketing an account is just stupid. I'm not saying the app is stupid, but I don't want to make an account just for music. Five stars if this feature wasn't there."

Pandora,Good vibes!,Shane,16-Jul-13,5,"I love this app however, I DESPISE the commercials!  Yet how can Pandora pay the bills if I don't pony-up for a subscription for commercial free listening...but doesn't that defeat the idea of free internet radio?  Consequently, I'll endure the limited interruptions...it's better than FM.  I can select the style of music I'm feeling without having to slit my wrist from being subjected to the no talent, lack of common sense, Bieber."
Pandora,Five Stars,Rita F.,18-Jul-17,5,Great
Pandora,Good App,Art W.,29-Apr-15,5,"So far I have never had it ask with on the Kindle app if ""I am still listening"" so that it a huge advantage to listening to Pandora on the computer. If anyone else has had a different experience I am curious to know about it--so let me know."
Pandora,Awesome,Julie E. Wiecks,30-Dec-13,5,"Thanks Pandora for being a free app. It is really inspiring to be able to choose the music I love, which helps an accomplishing artist like myself to stay motivated. I play you both on my awesome sound system on my 27inch monitor, as well as on my tablet. I use my quad core computer and monitor n my studio, and my tablet when I am traveling around doing paintings and drawings of clients.You're a great help to an artist, please stay a free app for me,You're and awesome group!Julie"
Pandora,Amazing breadth of music.,jbolernc,27-Dec-13,5,"I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer.  I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up.  Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound.  I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour.  I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station."
Pandora,Free but the Advertisements makes this not so good,Kvinna,15-Sep-17,2,"PandoraToo many advertisements and they come up where it is easy to accidentally click on the advertisements.Free is good, but not when they put advertisements where you can accidentally click on them."
Pandora,I love it. I really like how you can type ...,Yvonne,29-Mar-16,5,I love it.  I really like how you can type in an artist's name and hear their music and music similar to that artist.  Also you can change artist at will.
Pandora,Superi-ear!,thethreesturgis,1-Apr-14,5,"It's free everywhere - on my phone, in my car, on my TVs, tablets, computers at work, at home. Of course the ads are a bit bothersome but it's free.  Sometimes a song comes on I am not fond of so I skip it - can't do that on the radio and it's still free.  I love Pandora.  The variety available just by entering an artist's or group's name is amazing - even somewhat obscure names will bring a good mix of music in that genre or style."
Pandora,Good music,mrtolson,25-Jul-17,4,It's alright.
Pandora,Enjoy Pandora,Fantaski,14-Dec-16,5,Pandora is fantastic. The music selection for each station is so enjoyable and creative. Listening to Pandora is loaded with pleasure.

Pandora,Not that happy,Annamarie,15-Nov-13,3,"It starts and stops at the weirdest times.  I'm all happy enjoying my music and then it will stop.  I'm not that happy about this.  Also, it keeps ""suggesting"" that I up grade, which means a monthly fee.  This maybe how they get you to upgrade, starting and stopping.  I am going to look into other media."

Pandora,Happy Hippy,Caroline,31-Jul-15,5,"Love all the channels...... especially Shuffle because I can pick stations to shuffle. I have Pandora on my phone, computer, TV and tablet. My favorite station is Pop 80's and a couple that I created. Loggins and Messina and Peter Frampton....."
Pandora,Make your own stations.,Terry and Amy Wilson,31-Jan-14,5,"We love making our own stations - like Disney for the kids.  This way, they can listen to all the music from their favorite movies.  Plus, mom & dad can have a station too.  As many as you want with different genres.  We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV.  It's a win-win when cleaning the house or just wanting some peaceful background music."
Pandora,A Great Investment,Emily Munn,2-Sep-15,5,Free Pandora is awesome but you have commercials every Five or six songs. That's okay because it is free. You can pay and get no commercials. I've found some amazing bands that I would have never known existed. Thanks

Pandora,Love it beats the chit chat on commercial radio stations.,Wise 24153,20-Oct-17,5,"Love it! Personalized listening. Use this in my car pretty much exclusively - beats paying for Sirius XM because I have more control of what I hear and don't hear. Also beats all of the commercials and chit chat on local stations. Uses very little cellular data which is excellent.  I have the free version; there are commercials, but I don't mind as they are way less frequent than commercial radio.I no longer have 15 minutes of talk during my 20 min drive to work -- can listen to more upbeat stuff to wake me in the morning, podcasts for interesting stuff, and more mellow favorites as I de-stress on the drive home."
Pandora,Better than listening to radio,Bill,3-Jun-17,5,Great music you can pick music to whatever mood you are feeling it is a good pick me up when you're feeling down I am happy very happy with Pandora
Pandora,BROKEN!!!!,Richard L. Dessin,5-Apr-16,1,The last update broke it.  I only get a blue screen with pandora in the center and 7.0 in the lower right hand corner. After that it goes black sometimes locking up my Galaxy S5 phone.

Pandora,Five Stars,Darl,30-Jul-17,5,Love Pandora!
Pandora,I love being able to listen to the kind of music I like,Larry  Pavey,2-May-13,5,I love Pandora. It is very nice being able to listen to only music that you like. I originally subscribed to Pandora on my computer and really don't plan on using it on my Kindle. If there is any downside to Pandora it is that there is not as much variety as I would like. By that I mean that if you put an artist on Pandora you may only have a small number of that artist's songs available. Therefore you may have to listen to 5 or 10 songs by that artist over and over.
Pandora,One Star,Lisa haas,13-Jul-17,1,no good
Pandora,Five Stars,Cal,13-Jun-17,5,Good Apt
Pandora,Use it all the time,Adam Lichtenauer,7-Jun-13,4,"Its pretty great, but there were soooooo many commercials and adds.  I pushed through it, but THEN they limited the amount of time you can listen on mobile devices, and I drive all the time so at that point it was stop using it or pay the $3 a month... I upgraded, and its better now but its still very irritating that they always do this ""are you still listening"" nonsense.  My response is, ""NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU JUST SHUT OFF MY MUSIC.""  I still use it constantly though so at the end of the day I suppose that should say something."
Pandora,Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs,JudithMB,7-Sep-15,4,I've had Pandora on my computer for years.  Recently downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  Now all I have to do is figure out how to connect (again) to my bluetooth capable sound bar.  Pandora is easy to use and to accept or reject various songs.
Pandora,This is my view for Pandora,Glenn M. Beckwith,23-Jan-16,4,Pandora is a great app....when I'm away from the Internet then the song's stops playing .....then I have to switch to a different app called Headphones Google play music. ...when the data comes on. ...the play music app works with Internet and without. ..
Pandora,Five Stars,R h HARDAWAY,13-Oct-17,5,Very good app
Pandora,If you want to hear your music you will love Pandora,Kindle Customer,14-May-13,5,Pandora is free if you don't mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and don't like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations.
Pandora,Pandora often over promises and under delivers.,Penny Cunningham,1-Jan-15,2,"Pandora seems fine as long as your taste in music runs to current and popular works.  If you want something more eclectic, not so hot.  Or perhaps they're targeting people under 40, with only lip service to older demographics.  The diversity of content of people who want music that was popular prior to 1980 is fairly sparse, and basically lumped together based on the year rather than format.  There's just no other explanation for putting Jerry Lee Louis and Dean Martin on the same play list supposedly geared to 1950s rock n roll.  Of course, you can ""skip"" the Dean Martin song, but if you also skip the Frank Sinatra and Perry Como songs that immediately follow, you exceed your ""skip"" quotient with the ""free"" version.  Basically, even with contemporary music, I find their alogrithms in need of either code writers with a better understanding of the various music genres or much tighter parameters.  I have seen very little improvement in this during the past 5 years with ""stations"" I try to construct, so it gets longer and longer between the times I actually use Pandora.  Do have to say that their ""Rockin Holidays Radio"" station pretty much delivered on its promise, so there is someone in programming that ""gets it.""  Hopefully that person will have a larger role in the overall experience going forward."
Pandora,Ready set listen,S.South Dakota,15-Jun-17,5,Wonderful!!

Pandora,Best Music Radio App,Meme,2-Oct-13,5,"I've been using Pandora for years and I have I on all my devices, my Optimus and iPad. I have tried other music app as well, but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they've made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they're released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some  your own selections of songs, you'll love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. There's no way you'll be disappointed with it."

Pandora,A must for music lovers,Dachzz,29-Jun-14,4,"I love it when I can't sleep or want to hear new things.  I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone.  It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music.  I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection."

Pandora,Pandora,gary l.,17-Aug-13,4,"I love Pandora! It is free ( at least for now tho' I heard a rumor that they were going to start charging, at which time I'll cancel) and you are able to bookmark songs and groups, build a list of ""stations"" to listen to, and change and alter items according to your listening habits. My taste runs pretty eclectic from an Eddie Cochran station to Mumphord and Sons. So give a trial run and I think you'll become a Pandora fan."
Pandora,I LOVE IT!!!!!,Sam,20-Nov-12,5,I love Pandora! its my favoriot and most visited app. the only problem is you can only skip 6 times.
Pandora,Music for Your Taste and Mood --- on the cheap,Michael J Schuler,7-Jan-14,5,"I love Pandora and listened through the occasional commercials for free for years. Recently, I finally discovered how totally cheap a subscription is (just a couple of bucks a month!) and signed up as a paying customer. No more ads --- wish I'd not been so cheap and done it years ago.Only down side: my girlfriend likes the availability of lyrics and has to sing along..."
Pandora,Free-Music-Streaming,Christopher Jennings,6-Nov-15,5,"Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist. Also has a great ability to suggest songs that you wouldn't normally listen to, but are a similar type of music as the playlist you're listening to."
Pandora,"If you don't have the updated version, don't get the update",Cutiegal6625,14-Jul-13,4,"I love love loved Pandora because I could listen free to music all the time on my tablet.  I got the update, wondering what would be different, and now I can only listen to 40 hours of free music on a mobile device.  I can still listen on my computer but my tablet has better quality speakers.  Now I don't listen to Pandora as much as I used to and that makes me upset.  If I had unlimited free music like I used to I would give it 5 stars.  You can pay four dollars a month to remove ads and have unlimited music but I not paying money for the subscription"
Pandora,I don't know how I lived without it,Kaspasia,20-Jan-13,5,"Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I donâ€™t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music Iâ€™m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you canâ€™t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing heâ€™s doing it and it drives me nuts!"

Pandora,Should have gotten app. sooner!!,VLS,25-Jul-17,5,Great app!!  Wish I had downloaded this months ago... We have this at my work and I love it!  Why did I wait so long to get it for myself!?
Pandora,Don't bother with phone app!!!  Read below for a great desktop trick.,Senor Ektor,17-Mar-13,2,"Used to be the shizzle for the phone.  Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream.  WTF?  And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month.  I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc.  40 hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads.  You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review.  On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads.  UNLESS . . .  you know a trick, like I do.  And yes, it's completely legal.For your home pc, Google ""Adam Haile Elpis"".  Click on the first hit.  Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora.  In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora.  Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things.  1- it allows you to have unlimited skips.  2- it will not download any ads.  In other words, it simulates the pay service.YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"

Every song that plays I say "" How do they know I like that song and artist?"". Great app, and the price is right, nothing. I do not even hear the occasional ad they throw in."
Pandora,Bugs finally squashed,Charles Wright,3-Apr-13,4,"Pandora has been with me since its inception and on a 3G connection on an iPhone it worked GREAT.When I took the plunge into the world of Android and 4G I had a problem with Pandora not wanting to work or was very sluggish between songs. It seems they have rectified that situation and all is good now. I can drive just about anywhere and have my music playing non-stop.A couple of things for them to think about. I would like to see the ads more geared towards the particular user that is listening to music... one that listens to 'nature' or 'classical' is a different creature than one that listens to 'rap', 'rock', 'pop', etc. Regional ads would be great too. I would love to know that my local convenience store that is just down the street is having a sale on some widget.All in all it was a rocky start and I went back to listening to other services for a while until Pandora got their act together and got an update out that fixed their problems. Since then... smooth sailing.Pandora ROCKS!"
Pandora,How did I live without it all my life?,Jackster,28-Nov-14,5,Gotta love pandora. Like a dream come true right? Create your own stations based on your own favorite songs. Skip a song if you don't like it or not in the mood? Does it get any better? How did I live without it? Besides what a way to get in the zone when working?
Pandora,"I LOVE Pandora, and use it daily!",Angel,19-Jun-12,5,"I have been using Pandora as a paid member, for years since before the 'app' came out. Now its everywhere, in my kindle, my iPhone, and even in a program form for my PC. Its my favortite App and Music Player. I have various moods for music, and by the entry of one song for the mood I'm in, it instinctivly plays other songs around that genre and style. Like sometimes I'm in the Lady Gaga mood, and then I listen to main stream dance pop for the evening. Other times I want to hear some Nickleback or Papa Roach, and then I am jamming to that and all simular songs. Another perk is it plays current new 'in' songs from that genre so I do get exposed to fresh music around my favorites selections, so its always expanding my musical horizons as well as keeping me saticfied with what ever mood I am in at the moment. I pay the anual fee for several years now, because.... who wants commercials? Why not pay them to help them operate their service, instead of letting advertizing agencies pay them and force their product in my face? I never hear commercials, which is one reason why I canceled my Satilight Radio service and switched to Pandora. ALSO it's MUCH cheaper annually than XM Radio, and can be heard on any internet device, unlike XM Radio, where only on registered devices. This is a great internet radio service :)"

Pandora,Pandora for your Kindle!!!!,ST,11-Dec-13,5,"I mean, it's Pandora Radio...on your Kindle. What else do I need to say? It works just like the mobile app. Ok the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app, you have to pretty much go to your Home Page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap ""Quit"". If you tap the Home button, it continues to play in the background. No big deal, and its a little weird to me probably because I've only had the Kindle for a little over a month."

After some recent updates, they now have pop up ads that are a little intrusive but for me I use this the most when I am driving so I am not looking at the screen.lag time in between songs is usually pretty good (not as quick as the desktop version with high speed internet connection) but overall not bad considering that I'm driving through numerous cell towers as I'm usually listening to Pandora.  lag time can also be due to my Droid Pro, I have been having issues with it lately.Nice album art when its playing (too bad it usually gets covered up with the ads) and very easy to use command buttons."

Pandora,Thumps Up Music App,mrskycar,8-Feb-14,4,I use Pandora because of the thumbs up down system and that the service itself is free. The app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens. Actually most apps today don't take this screen size limitation or scaling into account and that impacts my use of the app. Otherwise good.

Pandora,Five Stars,KJ,17-Oct-17,5,Luv it!!!
Pandora,Its nice,Amazon Customer,14-Apr-13,3,Not the best app ive seen but its better hen other radio apps. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that's why its amazing but if you don't like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that's not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app.

Pandora,pandora,Bryan Karlik,24-Feb-13,4,"Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference."

It's great and worth having, unless  you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again.  Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music.  In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU!  How good is that!?"

Pandora,Best thing to happen to music since the electric guitar,Bud Caldwell,22-Dec-11,5,"In the interest of full disclosure, I don't have a Kindle Fire. But, if I did, Pandora would be the first App I'd put on it. (I'm here investigating it for a friend.)Pandora is the best thing to happen to music since the electric guitar was invented. I use it almost every day - at work on my PC or my iPod, at home on my TiVo HD (over my home audio system where it sounds awesome), and on the road over my Android phone. It takes a little tuning to create unique, individual stations. You have to carefully choose seed songs & artists and ""thumb up"" songs that match the station concept and ""thumb down"" songs that don't, even it you like the song. Otherwise, all of your stations start to sound alike.Create one variety station where you ""thumb up"" everything you like and ""thumb down"" everything you don't like and Pandora will zero in on exactly what your kind of music is (and even describe it to you). That will be your favorite station (like having your own personal radio station). But also, create different stations for different moods or situations and ""prune"" them (using the web site) by removing songs from the ""thumbs up"" that don't belong there when a station starts to drift too much.I pay the small annual fee to get no commercials. worth every penny."

Pandora,Its a radio station which allows you to influence the play list... how cool is that!?,daleraby,23-Aug-13,5,"I like the Seekers, The Carpenters, Keali'i Reichel, Asuca Hayashi, Marty Robbins... and a whole bunch of other artists that are no longer (if they ever were) mainstream.  Very hard to find a radio station that plays ""my"" music.  This app logs into your Pandora account and plays your music for you.  No issues, just pure functionality.  What's not to like?"
Pandora,Pandora Strikes Again...,Ira Anthony Bube,15-Sep-14,5,"This is another app that was purchased by one of my daughters.  And therefore, she has said that this is an excellent app to have installed on either a phone, tablet, or something else.  In actuality, all 3 of my daughters enjoy this app and are thrilled to be able to have access to something enjoyable like this everyday."
Pandora,I LOVE IT SO MUCH,Breathless,23-Feb-15,5,YEAH!!!!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I love music all kinds every kind of music. The great thing about having it on P. is I can do myChair Arobics with the music I love at the same time
Pandora,Amazing,NancyV,8-Jun-13,4,"This app is so fun! It requires internet so you can't really play it anywhere, but that's the only really I can find. It helped me find new songs that I've never heard before and surprisingly I like those songs. The music range is so wide that you can pick basically any type of music, even instrumental and foreign.  I recommend this to anyone who hasn't installed this yet. You won't be disappointed!"
Pandora,Pandora,Sandra,7-Nov-16,5,Great listening music
Pandora,Five Stars,Kindle Customer,13-Oct-16,5,Great place for music
Pandora,"Good service, annoying ads.",Bort,19-Apr-14,4,"Pandora has a good service and exposes me to artists that I might not normally find. I like the ability to rate music I'm listening to, with thumbs down going away, forever. I wish there were a way to change that, though, and if there is I've not found it. The ads are obnoxious, though - not only do you have to listen to them but they pop up in app and are very easy to inadvertently trigger. Really guys? Can't just pick one way for ad delivery? Also kind've lame considering you, Pandora, do not pay a lot of the artists for the media usage rights, but we'll just see how the court case pans out on that one.  I hope you get it figured out and survive because I really enjoy the service you provide."
Pandora,Love it,francho,5-Sep-12,4,"it used to work nicely on my G-Tab (honeycomb), but since this last update I only get a blue screen.  hopefully this will get resolved soon?  I am at a loss for how to rate this because before it was just fine.I will give it a one star until it gets working again.Update 11/29/2012:I restarted my tablet a couple of times and now it works just fine (again).  Therefore, I am back to the 4 stars that this great APP deserves."
Pandora,It's like your own personal radio station,MominMaine,21-Jan-14,5,"I love Pandora, great variety and super easy to set up stations.  You can have multiple based on different types of music or mix all kinds of music together into one station.  It is easy to change around stations as well just by adding new artists to the starting list for that station.  Great to have on as background for work."
Pandora,Almost perfect,Syres20,3-Aug-13,4,"Very good app, but I wish they would allow for better mix of music like dj mixes.  There are other app that give those options, like SoundCloud and FitRadio.  It's a bit annoying to receive a message asking if I'm still there listening, like I'm supposed to be holding the phone at all times touching the menu buttons....stop it with the separation anxiety Pandora!!!"
Pandora,the best thing since sliced pickles,c. kent,2-Apr-14,5,"As stated above ""The best thing since sliced butter spreads""  But seriously, I do like when they select a similar artist or song  from what you have picked because you may discover a new talent that you may really enjoy....Peace and love !!!"
Pandora,I love pandora as I can have more options to play ...,Myrna Mallorca,20-Feb-16,4,I love pandora as I can have more options to play which music  I want. Just wish I don't have a limit to fast forward if I want to fast forward a song. Otherwise I'm happy with it!
Pandora,It give such a great variety of music,Maria Harris,5-Dec-16,5,"Of course I use Pandora everyday. It give such a great variety of music, music that is not played on my local radio station. I love it."
Pandora,To send emails to guest without the owners permission???,Di,13-Jun-13,1,I have this app on my phone and home PC but I have never seen the permission to send email to guest without your permission before till I started to install it here on my tablet. just as I was about to click to install there it was among all the other premissions. I canceled the install and went back to the Amazon app store description for Pandora and it isnt listed there yet. Must be a new permission.  IM not installing it here.

Pandora,Goood Music,Mr. Roberts,11-May-15,4,"Good back ground music, easy to program. I run it through my smart TV and into my AMP. I've had it shut down at times but I change the block of music and it works fine."
Pandora,"A radio station all your own, for the cost of bandwidth!",Teri,3-Jun-12,5,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for World, or George Winston-type New Age piano, or broader New Age stuff. So those are my current formats on Pandora! ""Followers"" can listen in, too. (I don't mean Facebook; Pandora has their own system.) Pandora's computers play stuff for you based on your initial stated preference of artist or song each time you're in the mood for something you haven't been listening to on Pandora yet.  And you are able to vote each song up or down, or to skip the current piece. It's basically an interactive music collection, vastly larger than the records or tapes or discs you could or would store at home. OTOH it doesn't make you assemble and buy song by song like for your own iPodÂ® either. They've scientifically analyzed recorded music based on elements like tempo, culture, mood, rhythm, instrumentation, even key, time signature, etc., and base their choices for you on the characteristics contained in your first choice, as well as on your subsequent votes. (They really want your votes too. If you go too long without voting, they'll stop and post a notice making sure you're still listening, and remind you they can't afford ""playing to an empty room""!)The free service includes audio and even video commercials, even ones local to your market. I don't usually mind, in fact, as an old radio hand, I like how ""stop-sets"" break it up a little, especially in the absence of DJs or news. Some ads are targeted for your gender, too. But I heard a political ad recently, which I felt violated the mood. Also, sometimes songs or ads get cut off. And they do warn you this can chew up alot of your monthly MBs or GBs. You can pay to stop the ads and improve sound quality even more than what I find perfectly adequate for my laptop or tablet speakers, currently $36US/year IIRC, and I might do that, as this US election year promises/threatens to carpet-bomb us with ads of the worst kind yet.If your screen is big enough they also send, with each song as it's playing, album art, artist information if available, and the scientific reasons why they think this song fits your format (though I'm not sure ""headnodic"" is a word!!). So I've learned a lot about music I've always wondered about... without the financial pain of buying discs or songs blindly.One thing you can't do is request *by* format or scientific characteristic. I'm part Native American, but city-raised, so I just typed that into the box; but if you don't know an artist or song title, the system can't help you.You can also get the service through [...], without this app, but I don't know how that would work out on a smaller device.Long story short, this may be the future of music radio -- ""narrowcasting,"" even self-help."
Pandora,Five Stars,francine f.,20-Nov-16,5,Love it
Pandora,Four Stars,Lori A Meyers,11-Aug-17,4,I love that you can choose pretty much whatever type of music to listen to.

Pandora,Requires time,Eric R. Caron,12-May-14,4,"I have been thumbing up and down songs for five years now. Once you have spent time culling through the collection, it becomes a wonderful radio station that plays 90% of just what you like. Until you have put in that amount of time, it will play totally random stuff that has nothing to do with the song seeds you started with."
Pandora,It's just great. Perfect music selections,Frederick D.,18-Jul-17,5,It's just great.  Perfect music selections. Easy to use.
Pandora,I love Pandora!,Jannby,14-May-16,5,"Pandora enables me to stream a huge variety of music genres on my Bose system at home and on the go on my mobile devices. I enjoy all types of music but Christian is my favorite. There are endless choices within that genre, something for every mood and taste."
Pandora,Pandora Rocks!,Randy Allen,16-Jul-14,5,"I even subscribed to the Pandora one over Sirius.  $4.99 for Pandora, over $15.00 for Sirius per month.  I don't like Howard Stern that much.  I like to be able to skip a song if I don't like it, but do not like that this option is limited per day.  Got it because my motorcycle radio's reception sucks.  Crystal clear and integrates with my motorcycle radio from my iphone through a simple FM transmitter."

Pandora,Pandora for Kindle <3,Rhenda,9-Jan-14,4,"VERY nice!  I am very pleased with how Pandora looks and performs on Kindle Fire.  The only issue is that about half the time when I turn it on, it quickly shuts back off and I have to restart it (then it stays on), but I don't find that too be a huge issue. It is more pleasing to use and look at on my Kindle than it is on my PC.  I really like it."
Pandora,Awesome!!!,Lori E. Novotny,20-Dec-16,5,"My original music player, love this app!! Especially when I want a mix and don't feel like handpicking each and every song"

Pandora,Pandora is the cats meow.,Alice2,22-Feb-14,5,"Pandora is my standby go-to app for online streaming.  I love being able to read about the artists, and the 'similar artists' while listening.  Your stations become more personalized with time as you click the Like / Dislike buttons.  Its not the only game in town and it doesn't do offline saving/listening, but what it does, it does good."
Pandora,Love pandora,mountianhome,18-Jul-17,5,Unclear why I had to download dish music app to use it.
Pandora,Pandora is the Best!,Mia Grace,5-Dec-13,5,"Pandora is an App everybody should have.  It's better than any other music App.  It is free and you can listen to particular songs, genre, or albums that you love.  We were looking for a real radio station with holiday music, when I thought, wait a minute, let's listen on Pandora. My sister had me install Pandora on her phone right then.  It is great!"
Pandora,Great app,Tonya,31-Jul-15,5,I love Pandora radio there's plenty varietys  of music to fit everyones needs. I have one of the Bluetooth lightbulbs and I always have mine hooked up to the Pandora radio. It's the only music app I use.
Pandora,Perfect fit for my new Fire D6 tablet,Boomer,26-Jul-15,5,"Perfect fit for my new Fire D6 tablet.  When I exercise and walk the treadmill each morning I get a continuous supply of great music.  I really like being able to select the type music I would like. For an hour each morning I get uninterrupted classic rock - Pink Floyd, Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.  Without the music I am not sure I could complete the arduous exercise, but Pandora makes it a pleasure.  One just cannot beat it for the price."
Pandora,ugly and not easy to use.,A. Samudio,29-Dec-12,2,"If you're trying to go back and discover the last track you listened to instead of swiping back you have to turn the kindle on its side and push the arrow button...not intuitive, not easily discovered unless you do it on accident.Why is the app do boring and blocky looking? The iOS Pandora app is far more attractive, why not give the kindle the same sort of sleek offerings instead of something that looks like an afterthought?The kindle fire he app store has been so disappointing in general."
Pandora,incredible music collection.,Amazon Customer,2-May-14,5,"Whatever you want to hear, Pandora has it and will play it for you for free. You choose your stations, you create as many stations as you want and it all waits for your next listening session or mood or activity. With thumb up and thumb down option, you can eventually have a huge playlist of favorites only. Pandora is great."
Pandora,Pretty Cool Stuff. But...,LongDongWong Reviews,29-Nov-14,4,"Pandora is amazing but sometimes  the person your interested in, in music of course the he/she s music wanders off somewhere else. Say for instance you wanna hear  Taylor Swift after a while it goes to lets say the band  Maroon 5. BUT I would suggest it. It's free anyway."
Pandora,Love it,JesusistheWay,30-Dec-15,5,The GREATEST music app. available. Great selection of stations. Very few commercials.
Pandora,Great variety!,Tracie,17-Jul-16,5,I love listening to the variety of old and new songs with very few commercials. What's especially great about Pandora is that I can choose the kind of music I like!
Pandora,I love it!,&Ccedil;hocoCherryChucks,9-Aug-14,5,"I love Pandora! Its my own personalized radio. it plays every song you can think of.so you make your own radio by typing in an artist/song and it creates it, then it also plays other similar artists. and you can add as many different artists on one radio you want, or you can make as many individual  radios as you want also."
Pandora,Too time consuming.,Richard Flannigan,26-Dec-14,1,"In spite of any ads for Pandora, song selections are limited. Stations must be ""tuned in."" To get a station to lat the music you want it is necessary to pay attention to what you are playing, reject songs not of that artist or genre, and accept songs that are appropriate."
Pandora,Review a bit different this time. But 5 star worthy even though I don't have the true experience to rate...,Karen,28-Apr-14,5,"As I downloaded for my 20 year old so I cannot truly give  proper feedback. However, I will tell you that she continues to use it after many, many months. She sets it up on a Bluetooth speaker and seems to like it so I will give it 5 stars. If she had problems, it would have definitely been deleted! Hope this somewhat helps."
Pandora,Five Stars,Romeo Ravara,25-May-17,5,Easy listening
Pandora,Love Pandora,Amazon Customer,13-Apr-14,5,"I have been using Pandora for many years. I have created many of my own stations and added a lot of preset type stations from them. If you don't like what is on one station you will almost certainly find something on another. I use the free version but if you do listen a lot like my daughter, you might like the yearly or monthly subscription."
Pandora,It does a good job of guessing what other music I like and ...,Amazon Customer,2-Feb-16,4,Pandora is how I listen to most of my music. It has a huge verity of music and artists. It does a good job of guessing what other music I like and gives me 100 different artists or playlists at a time in my library to chose from. Plus it still gives me the option to skip or dismiss a song if I don't like it.
Pandora,"Love, love",vicky agnew,30-Aug-17,5,"Love, love, love pandora. I can never get enough of every kind of music I love. In the house on a walk and while I am mowing the lawn. It's always easy to get."

Pandora,intrusive display ads that got annoying but its song library is massive,ALP1974,30-Jul-15,4,"Large, intrusive display ads that got annoying but its song library is massive, and its programming works wonderfully. Extremely easy to use, but it's also very good at getting to know your musical taste. The ads are why I only gave 4 stars."

Pandora,Its Ok,Susan Tenney,5-Apr-14,3,"I liked the idea that I could listen to my music virtually commercial free...the ones I did hear weren't yelling at me like the radio stations do.  The only drawback that I found was that after a few songs, it stopped playing.  When I tried to reload it, it wouldn't so I went back to my saved music I have on my micro SD card."

Pandora,Music Player for Kindles,Amazon Customer,17-Mar-14,5,"As long as you have access to the Internet, you will have access to Pandora.com, which has a large database of available tunes.  You can decide which genre you want and adjust it to play only what you want to hear.  It will, however, make suggestions based upon your preferences.  It's almost like owning your own radio station."
Pandora,How can you not love this?,sbypackerfan,29-Dec-12,5,"How can you not  love Pandora? It is so easy to use and it seems to play what you want to hear when you need to hear it.

Pandora,Check coverage (if outside the US) before bothering to download it.,Bernardo Kuri,31-Dec-14,2,"I used to love Pandora, until they decided to leave Mexico out of their service area.

And the industry is going that way, BTW.Pandora is worth it. $36 for 1 year. Free if you want to take more advertisements.XM I can get 6 months for $25.Everything is going open source. And the advertisements are getting heavy.For all relating to Open Source/ie free/ the best website to figure this out is alternativesto.net"

Once it's downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you've created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone.  Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step.  Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there.  Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web.  But they're short compared to commercial radio.  And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all.  The music will be higher quality (192K bits per second) and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device."

Pandora,Who Doesn't Like Pandora?,Callie Kleeb,18-Aug-14,5,I've always loved Pandora since day one! It's downloaded on all of my devices and I love to listen to when I sleep. I just don't like after every 2 or 3 songs there's 1 or 2 advertisements. I was paying for Pandora One so I wouldn't have ads but it just got ridiculous but I still love Pandora.
Pandora,Not sure why I listen,Brian McFadden,24-Aug-17,3,"""Are you still listening?"" Give me a break. To many of the same songs repeat way to often."
Pandora,Five Stars,Lisa Davis,26-Oct-16,5,Love it!
Pandora,music,Sue G.,8-Jun-15,4,Like any good thing you would like it all to be ad free. But you can't have everything. Even the small amount of ad's with free pandora is not to bad. The site also offers you a great collection of music with any genre you can think of.
Pandora,very great music,Ashleigh Morris,23-Sep-17,5,"and the cool part is that when you get a soundtrack,it plays some of the music, but it plays music like it and that's what makes it fun."

Pandora,Awesome,tatorbug48,24-Feb-15,4,"I love the Pandora app, it performs wonderfully on my kindle fire hd.  I would love it even more if you could give songs a thumbs up/down when you swipe down from the top. I tend to listen to Pandora while browsing the web or playing games on my kindle so it makes it hard to go back and forth; it would be so much more efficient with that feature."
Pandora,Music your way.,Inzider Z,18-May-12,5,"This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as ""Beatles"". You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I don't know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you didn't know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices (computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc.) without having to recreate them. If you're a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet."
Pandora,Pandora works for me,dustbunny,18-Jan-13,5,"I like it very much since I don't have a stereo right at the moment.  I turn it on, on my phone and it sounds pretty good!  Cleaned the house for 3 hours and had a good time jamming with Pandora !"

Pandora,Almost Perfect,Michael P. McParland,29-Jan-14,5,I absolutely love this app. After getting your favorite groups and songs into and as playlists start telling it which songs you like and don't. As the Alger rhythm goes along the playlists start to become just about right on target for what you want. Only throwing in the odd song that makes no sense. Most definitely worth it.
Pandora,Awesome radio....,austinsluv,28-Dec-12,5,"Pandora is a great media outlet when I want to listen to a variety of music while working online or studying for my classes.  It gives me an outlet of all types of music from Classical to Modern Country, Old Rock and Pop that I have listened to all my life.  Type in an artist's name and a radio station will pop up with this artist's songs with an addition of songs similar to the type of music presented.  Love it Love it..."

You can comment on songs, look up the lyrics(without going on the internet), and best of all create your on stations.  The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is that it has too many adds. I realise you can upgrade to Pandora one but it is expensive. I would recommend this app but if you despise adds this is not the right app for you."

I found it highly stereotypical. And borderline offensive. I pick English as my language but because I live in a certain zip code in Los Angeles County it has all spanish commercials.
Pandora,"Pandora Rocks The Planet, tick,  ....  TOCK",Lissa Rendon,16-Nov-15,5,"Pandora makes Gracenote look like Chump Change, Full Spectrum, Broad Beam and the Music isn't so bad either, With 360 of pulse pounding music,  it is sure to even wake up a MUMMY or TWO,  so with a 1 being the lowest and a 10 being the highest remark, I grade Pandora, a 999 ZILLION PERCENT excellence award,SO A BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS AT PANDORA,  Sincerely, John Adam Rendo'n  <<<((({{{  J A R  }}})))>>>"

Pandora,"Reliable, good interface, and good quality",Danny Yu,1-Apr-12,5,"Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned, I've nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I've experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strengthThe interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an ""i,"" which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. It's not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."

In my opinion, it is absolutely wonderful. The ability to have the kind of music we both enjoy is what our leisure listening time is about. The commercials are very few and if it should become an issue with us, we will opt for the non-commercial version"
Pandora,Good Internet Radio App - Recommended,C. Hill,17-Nov-11,4,"This is one of the most used apps on my Android phone and tablet, providing streaming music to my device. The app allows you to make channels based on your music preferences, but not necessarily letting pick individual songs. This is a free app so there are ads showing up on the screen, but they are not too intrusive.This works well for me where there is good Wi-Fi or 3G service.Recommended!CFH"

I am not a paid subscriber since depending on the device I am listening on has little very little to no commercial interruption. Like to see Pandora offer music videos as well, with and without a subscription."
Pandora,I like it,Astro,22-Dec-13,4,"I like the app of Pandora but lately they are giving a lot more commercial and sometimes when I am listening to their music start getting interruptions as lagging and is not my Wi-Fi, since I only have the problem with them but for a free app and music is good."
Pandora,The box that rocks,Greyfurgang,13-Nov-15,5,I completely understand where the name comes from as I download so much music from hearing it on the App. It is  Pandora's box and the elusive Rabbit hole combined. My wife and I both love it.
Pandora,"Great app, has my favorite songs",Betta Fish,3-Jul-13,4,"This is a great app, but i took the one star away because of the ads. They always get in the way, and as soon as I touch the screen, bam there's another one that covers the whole page. It gets annoying, and you have to pay like 3.99 a month just for no ads. Ridiculous. So yeah this app is better on a tablet or a phone with a huge screen so it doesn't cover the whole screen...but otherwise it's awesome. Doesn't really lag unless it's having a bad day...Galaxy Express i437"
Pandora,Would be five stars but for one feature (Updated:loses a star!),The Weekly Reader,16-Jan-12,5,"Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while doing other things like reading or browsing the web.  This review is more for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already.  If you already don't like Pandora for whatever reason, you're not going to like the app, obviously.Previously gave it 3 stars for lack of certain features like the ability to edit the Shuffle.  Used to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the ""QuickMix"" station list, especially considering that my preferred device for Pandora, my Kindle Fire, would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora.com on the silk browser.  Recent updates have added this missing functionality and more nice features--which seemed to have made it hang up once in a while, but that got fixed too-- and the Pandora app is now everything I wanted from it, so it has earned two more stars!  Way to go, it is about time!"

Pandora,for those with probs,that guy jonah,20-Jan-12,4,"if you had trouble changing the station(on the Kiele fire) then try go down below to where the home botton is and hit the botton in the middle with lines or the one that looks like a list and it will give you options.  just play around with it and you will find it, or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton.  now yes there are advertisements that play after 3-4 songs but the only way Pandora will be free is if they do those advertisements. they only last about 30 seconds.  i  have left my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora playing and it did not die. if you leave it playing but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play letting you save more battery power.Pandora is not good nor bad it just depeneds if you really want to PAY for the best servise. if you want free music of your choice on you kendle fire then maybe it is not so bad, but if you want the best then sure you can buy it."
Pandora,Five Stars,Ed in Ridgefield,28-Dec-16,5,"The choice of music is unlimited and easy to listen to on the computer, tablet or other internet medium."
Pandora,Great concept,bonny herman,23-Jan-14,5,Works for me since local radio is all country. I like smooth jazz like the WAVE in LA. Not there anymore and I miss certain things. This helps fill the gap.
Pandora,Pandora,Groff,29-Aug-12,4,"This is a great application made for those that already use Pandora radio.  It is perfectly integrated with their online system already set-up, so if you are plugged in online in a browser this application works great.Problems you'll find if you use the free version of Pandora:-The advertisements frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and are hard to close but easy to open.-You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station (where music comes from such as artists, songs, e.g.)*EDIT*-It is not possible to get a scrolling list of previously played music.  You can only view the one you are listening to at the moment.^ This is now possible.  They have fixed it and made the application even better.My qualms with the application, but it is good nonetheless."
Pandora,once upon a time. ..,Chyna1057,12-Aug-14,3,"This app used to be good but lately, its been pretty annoying; running in the background eating up my data plan ehrn I thought it was shut down.  Plays the same 5 songs in a row on my phone but when I listen yo the same station on my pc, now all these different better songs play.  I don't mind the commercials but if I can't get it to shut off when I close the app w/o the need to force close,  I might have to let it go."

On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says ""Pandora can't find any more music, try changing channels"" on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it's recently become totally unusable  as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it's it's same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."

Pandora,FREE: HALF TRUE,vivian jones,30-Dec-13,1,"I loved  the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not  frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount  of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I  was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life  now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their  free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned  that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start  up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being  deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was  free  and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a  solution that would allow someone  who  had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would  even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so  quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year  I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information.  It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."

I have read reviews of Pandora and most songs are not complete only one song occurred that was itI'm mostly taking the song issue more than the complete songsPandora stop picking your noses and fix these problems so we could keep listening and give you guys positive reviews its more simple than you think to do it I would be more than happy to delete and start listening to slacker etc

When I click on the Icon, the title screen comes up, but it won't load pass that stage. I tried deleting it and downloading the app again but nothing will fix it! I hope I'm the only one that has this problem because it is really a great thing, but I just wanted to warn the next person who gets this that this problem might happen to them."

I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection.I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists.I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't.My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song."

Pandora,BOOOO on Pandora,Mr. Casey Kuhn,21-Oct-17,1,"get this. pandora fades out songs at any point in a song to put in a commercial. most of them are to upgrade pandora. the rest are local area companies, which in my area is about 4 companies so every 10 min, i get to hear the same commercials. booooo on you pandora. the commercials on the screen where just fine and with all the free music options out there lets be honest, Pandora showed itself to be a fail. deleted and dismissed."

Pandora,Very good collection of songs and I don't have to pay ...,William Fleming,17-Sep-16,5,Very good collection of songs and I don't have to pay extra for them. I like the format of presenting songs that I might find similar in nature.I learn about and might even purchase titles that I hadn't been aware of.
Pandora,Five Stars,Jack,15-May-17,5,Great way to listen to all the music You like.

Pandora,Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth,Amazon Customer,6-Jan-16,1,"Was unaware I had even started a week-long trial, 3 month later I notice that my card is being charged monthly yet I hadn't used Pandora at all during that time period. I reached out to Pandora and they told me they wouldn't refund any of the charges because of their Terms and Conditions. Left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Not going to use Pandora when I can use Soundcloud instead."
Pandora,Absolute best app for music,Oceanlady1028wpb,6-Sep-17,5,Absolute best app for music.  Plays my personal picks at home on wireless speaker and in the car.  Music nirvana!
Pandora,music,Katherine M. Meinzer,24-Jan-14,5,I absolutely love Pandora!!  I listen to it all the time and I can change the music to what ever I'm in the mood for
Pandora,update ruined app.,Kindle Customer,7-Aug-15,1,"Update ruined this app. All it does now on every station is tell me &#34;we've run out of music for this station, please try a different station&#34;.Which I do and then it repeats all over again. Really disappointed. Really liked this app. Used it all the time..."
Pandora,Not Customer Friendly,Becca,12-Jul-12,3,"My Pandora was working wonderfully for awhile. I constantly heard a song that I had ""thumbed up"" so I decided to ""thumb down"" it. It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission.  I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."
Pandora,Can't imagine life without Pandora.,Carol B.,1-Nov-17,5,Pandora is the greatest invention of this century. I love that it connects me to new music and artists. It is all I listen to at home.

Pandora,Music for all my moods,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-17,5,I absolutely love it.
Pandora,Good app but not great,Taylor0622,27-Feb-16,3,Way too many ads. Like 2 or 3 in a row without music in between. And a lot of the songs sound nothing like the related station they're on. So I'm not sure how they select those. Overall I prefer YouTube.
Pandora,Five Stars,Tabatha,22-Jun-17,5,Very pleased

Pandora,Please change this.,heather,3-Jan-14,4,Who doesn't love free music? I know I do. The commercials don't even bother me. My problem is that sometimes I want to listen to a certian artist not artists that are similar to them.
Pandora,Four Stars,JOLENE M EVANS,2-Apr-17,4,And what's there not to like?
Pandora,Nearly perfect song selection on personal channels.,JAS,12-Sep-17,4,"Nearly right on with the choices of tunes selected on a channel I made.  Alas, when listening through the Echo there's no way to say thumbs down get this song off my channel but other than that, it's been right fun having my own personal channels of Wishbone Ash and King Crimson."
Pandora,Five Stars,Electron,3-Oct-17,5,I enjoy the music
Pandora,Best music radio!,Cat Landry,28-Jan-14,5,"I love Pandora. I appreciate that there are no commercials or over-the-top DJs spouting off about things nobody wants to hear. Pandora is just music. I have a station for every possible mood: from Slipknot, to Sting, to Yoga Radio. It's as versatile as I am. The ability to create stations by band, song, or genre. I like having the option of ""thumbs down"" when I don't want a particular song to be part of my listening experience. The variety is fantastic."
Pandora,Five Stars,Ed Hurst,5-Sep-16,5,I like being able to listen to the music I want to hear.

Pandora,Five Stars,Peep's Kittycat's Mom,3-Aug-17,5,I love Pandora!
Pandora,I love Pandora,Kate McMurry,28-Apr-12,5,"I have a paying account with Pandora on my desktop computer, and have had one for years. I don't like the blasts of 15-second ads you have to put up with when you have a free account. I was delighted to learn I could put Pandora on my iPhone. That app is free, so you can't beat the price! I have the iPhone with me everywhere, which I definitely cannot say about my desktop, so with this app I am using Pandora far more than I ever did before.As for Pandora itself, I like that I can set up many different ""channels,"" and Pandora will play a constant stream of similar types of music within a given channel. I can also change channels anytime I like. I often play a channel with rousing music first thing in the morning to wake me up, and a channel with soothing music while preparing for bed."

Pandora,It's nice to have  pandora- IT'S FREE!,Rambogirl,5-Apr-13,3,To many comercials. I do like the fact that I put in the Beattles and got a station with 70's music.What's not to like about that. The best music erra in the last 50 yrs. But the  advertisements put me off. I do understand that if it weren't for them -I wouldn't be getting a farout station. My 12 yr. old grandson loves pandora.
Pandora,The Best,CS,29-Dec-14,5,Simply the best as you can make your own stations from comedy to oldies.  Cheaper than satellite radio endless commercials.

Pandora,ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Justine Washington,9-Sep-13,5,"i am really really thinking about signing up for the permanent, no commercial one, because I simply love this.  I was switching back and for from this to Songza, because was stopping my service after 30 days of listening, and cutting me short, I guess because I listened to it too much, without signing up, but I think that has been discontinued, now Pandora is my #1 .....thanks Pandora, and I will be signing up for commercial-free listening soon"
Pandora,Pandora is better than YouTube,Rashon,11-Mar-15,5,"This format allows me to listen to the music of my favorite recording stars without interruption. And I can't really comment about Pandora without saying that I find it so much better than YouTube which now employs the irritating practice of dividing albums into sections - sections which , when one presses PLAY ALL, Don't play in their entirety."
Pandora,Then I found out how great it was and have added several other stations,K Elliott,7-Jan-17,5,Pandora is so enjoyable!!  I selected it because a friend told me about Ian Tyson radio.  Then I found out how great it was and have added several other stations.

Pandora,Music To My Ears!,Linzy,14-Oct-13,5,"This app is perfect for when you don't have a lot of tunes stored on your device or you want to listen to something you don't have. It's a great way to discover new music based on what you already enjoy. The suggestions make sense and I'm very happy to have this. Being an avid music listener, I tend to get bored of what I have easily. Pandora has helped me find some of my new favorite artists and discover old ones I've never heard of before. Great App!"
Pandora,I like being able to create stations and shuffle them,JulieF,10-Mar-16,4,I like being able to create stations and shuffle them.I learn about a lot of artists I wouldn't have known about any other way.I wish I could select specific songs.Doesn't seem to have some artists when I search.
Pandora,Enjoy the music but it quits playing for no apparent ...,Judy,29-May-17,4,Enjoy the music but it quits playing for no apparent reason - no ad.  This started when they changed their web page.
Pandora,Five Stars,PETER NAZARECHUK,8-Sep-17,5,Great. Thank you
Pandora,I'm disappointed :-(,Tracy,28-Oct-16,3,"Why can't I get this on my BlackBerry anymore? I'm sad now. :-( Yes I have an older phone, but don't hate. I like the app. Here lately it is playing too many of the same songs over and over. I might have to learn how to use the sleep function. The app is good at ""guessing"" what you might like."
Pandora,Definite must have for music lovers!,G.T.Gizra,11-Oct-16,5,"I love having good music in the background while reading, studying or just working on any project and this app fills that need admirably."
Pandora,limitations,Disappointed,28-Oct-17,3,Wish you could replay the song if you like it. The app has some limitations compared to other online music services.
Pandora,Annoying.,Tom Shaw,26-Jan-17,1,Only plays one song at a time and then I have to unlock my phone and open up the app to get the next song to play. Annoying.

Pandora,Meh...,B Kennedy,24-Mar-13,3,"Not sure if the permissions changed with the latest update or if I just never noticed, but why does Pandora need access to my personal info and the ability to send emails without knowledge?And not liking the whole ""play two songs then an ad or two"" set up. Not even the radio does that.I'm thinking it's time to go back to an MP3 player and download my music. No ads, no permissions, just me and the tunes..."

Pandora,Accessible Music 24/7,Sadie McC.,23-Apr-14,4,"No conventional radio station responds to your personal preferences.  Pandora does!  How cool is that?  Seriously, I am still learning how to use this app.  I am not a music junkie so this is a first for me.  I do not do the iPod and headphones thing, but this app for my Android is just great.  There are so many choices!!!"
Pandora,Pandora is Great - Check It Out,cdproductions1,11-Oct-15,5,I really enjoy Pandora - the selection is outstanding - this weekend I enjoyed listening to the Jazzmasters and it was simply the best.  The other selections are great but this weekend it's JAZZ BABY!
Pandora,Too many commercials,Douglas B Godfrey,14-Feb-14,2,"I have to say Apple radio is better than Pandora.  I really hate to use Pandora anymore because of the ads.  If I wanted to hear that many ads I would just listen to my local radio station.  The visual ads were one thing, but the audio ones are just annoying.  I advise everyone to delete Pandora for the sake of your music listening hours."

Pandora,Choices,Victoria L. Konradson,6-Aug-17,5,Love having choices!
Pandora,Pandora cutting off songs,John G. Scanlon,6-Nov-13,2,"I found Pandora only recently and at first loved it. I even paid the fee to get the enhanced service without commercials and longer stretches of music. Maybe its because I started listening to it more often at work that I started noticing this: Pandora regularly cuts off songs before they're over. At first I thought they were just chopping off a few seconds at the end, but today they cut off a four minute song after playing it for only 30 seconds. I've really noticed this when trying to use their shuffle feature - it seems a lot worse there.When I first found Pandora I thought it was awesome. But the whole point of it is listening to songs you like, and a service that cuts off songs you like while you're right in the middle of listening to them - it's becoming highly irritating. In the end, great idea, but I can't recommend them. Certainly not for money, and if people just want to listen for free, well, you get what you pay for."

Pandora,Great music app,JC,20-Feb-15,5,I love this app. The music sounds great. It is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this app.
Pandora,Joe reviews another one,Joey,7-Jun-13,5,"This is the best music app as far as radio is considered. There are very little adds and you can listen to anything you like. Lets say you like Queen, The Beatles, or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear, Boston, Adam and the ants, Electric Light Orchestra, and more great 70-80's bands."
Pandora,Like more options,Kevin J. McClelland,21-Jul-17,4,"Pandora is great, but it tends to repeat songs. It would be nice to have the opportunity to go through and select other songs."

Pandora,worst.,Chris,28-Aug-15,1,"a zero if i could write it.  They don't seem to take into account what i like and don't like. Also, there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version.  the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement.  Stay away and go to Songza or another site."

Pandora,It`s Pandora,Rushi G,14-Feb-13,5,"My experience with Pandora has actually been quite nice. My first use was on their mobile app. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to signup and setup my account, and it was a bit annoying, however after that the experience was great. The technology behind Pandora really predicted some really great music for me. I really loved how I could discover new tracks. In fact, even though other services have other features, thus far, Pandora has helped me discover the most music. The app feels solid, nothing brilliant, but it does what I want it to do, play music. It has a modern look, with slight bugs but it doesn`t really matter. Great service, and must try app!"
Pandora,Pandora,Michael Carvidi,1-Nov-14,2,Pandora is a great concept looks easy to use. It downloads and opens quickly on my Nokia phone . But then  Pandora does not work. I get the Pandora logo with a  message stating it is having trouble  playing  my next selection. The low rating is more for the lack of diagnostics than the app itself. I cant rate the app because I can't get into it !!
Pandora,have to keep uninstalling It on my phone about once ...,boyd,21-Aug-15,3,"have to keep uninstalling It on my phone about once a week and reinstalling it so that it will work in my vehicle.  don't know if this is a phone problem or a Pandora problem or if Pandora is just trying to get me to buy the updated version as in Pandora 1,  But if that is what their trying to do, it's not going to work.  If I can't get the free version to work, I'm surely not going to pay for it."

Can always build a better mouse trap and all that jazz. Havent had any problems with it just not playing lile other have said. Its also awesome in the fact that it will play even when you hit the sleep button on the kindle fire hd, so you dont have to burn that baterry so much to listen to music."
Pandora,Awesome way to listen to your favorite artists!,K Livermore,3-Nov-13,5,Awesome way to listen to your favorite artists! I dont know how I lived without Pandora!. Its the first thing I turn on before I head into the kitchen to cook. I love that it stays in the genre I prefer.

Pandora,inimicalnibel,inimicalnibel,2-Nov-12,2,"I'm increasingly disliking Pandora more and more everyday.  Just this morning Pandora crashed on my phone five times before playing a full song, and the night before was a constant crashing battle on my tablet.  Then the ads for the nonpaid version are overwhelming, and all too often uninteresting material, but the full version is now FAR too expensive for what little control the user actually has for me to even consider paying.  I used to love Pandora."
Pandora,Love!,A. White,5-May-13,4,"One of my favorite apps. Only negative things I can this of are that the thumbs down, and up are close by each other, so toddlers accidently press the wrong button. Also, it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic, or live versions right after the original recording of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip more songs, and not have to pay to get rid of adds, but it is understandable, and could be worse with them. They aren't as easy to accidently hit as on some apps, but I did still pay to not have them. I think it was worth paying, so I am not interrupted by loud adds. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."
Pandora,Best radio option,ted,28-Feb-14,5,"Pandora does an excellent job of playing the music I like. It is better than a theme dedicated radio station because I can mix types of music, such as country and blues. I can take it anywhere on my kindle. Commercials are few and unobtrusive. Superior to subscription satellite radio, this is the best music option for me."
Pandora,Pandora is Great,K. Ozenbaugh,28-Jan-14,4,My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it's just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it.  I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I don't like as well.  The pop ups are annoying and I understand I'm able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget.  How about discounts for seniors???

The fact that I can access it anywhere has helped me make it through road trips in the car and spinning at the gym. I only wish their play list for some of my favorite artists was longer/deeper. That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome."

Pandora,A Captain's Duty....,Sherry Vick,21-Jun-14,4,"I enjoyed reading the book. Got it right after seeing the movie, Captain Phillips.  I actually enjoyed the movie more because of Tom Hank's acting (last 20 minutes of film was tremendous).  Books give a little more detail, but in this case I didn't miss out by just seeing the movie.  However, the book was worth reading."
Pandora,Delightful,Amazon Customer,20-Sep-15,4,"Dont pay attention to the excessive ads, skip limits, and cutting the song off halfway through and Pandora is a awesome music app. I have enjoyed my time with Pandora and no one does music playing better. I recommend it to anyone who has ears."

I really like their feature allowing me to create stations around various genres and bands, so if a song pops into my head (and I know the band/singer doing it) I can create a station using that name and Pandora will play more of their stuff along with similar music from other artists.

Pandora,wish there was a search option,Everett Blake,23-May-14,5,"Love this app.  Would love it more if there was a search capability to find older music or artist.  Being a member of old school,  there are older tunes that would flow nicely in todays musical mix!

Pandora,Would of been a 5 star but....,Angela Simino,7-Dec-16,4,Okay. first this is a great app to have. I loved it when I was living in the USA. But now I am living in France and the app does not work here.  I miss mu music that I used to listen to.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it to were I can listen to Pandora's music again.
Pandora,Wonderful music,oshun,14-Jan-14,5,I thoroughly enjoy the music and there is a great variety. Very easy to listen to. Love it and would refer it to others.
Pandora,Music is Magic,Michael Lukacs,25-Mar-13,5,Pandora is one of the best things that I ever had on my computer.  Tobe able to listen to the type of music that I enjoy is remarkable.  Themusic selections that are played are everything that I truly enjoy.  Veryrarely do I ever have a thumbs down on my ratings.  I would highlyreccommend this to any music lover.  It is just like magic. Puff and themusic that you love is there.
Pandora,Buy this one right now.,John King,8-Jan-14,4,"I love this app.  I'm still a little be too new to my way around Pandora, but what I  know about it I enjoy.  Perfect for when I am reading a news article, enjoying a new book or just browsing the web.  It is going to take a few more days for me to learn my way around it, but it isn't difficult.  It is rich with ""customizing"""
Pandora,Great,Amazon Customer,20-Aug-17,5,Great
Pandora,.,River,15-Nov-12,4,"Great app, simple to use and gives me songs I actually really like. The only problem is the menu button does not seem to work for me so I have to press pause on a song and hit the home button on my device instead of being able to press 'quit'. Please fix."
Pandora,love it!,missy,26-Mar-13,5,"i love this app!  but only the paid version.  the ads in the free version are annoying beyond words.i like how you can customize your playlists, discover new artists in genre you like.i haven't listened to the radio in years because i'm sick of commercials and how they beat all songs deadby repeating them every 3 songs.  so discovering new artists and music is now done with Pandora.i do wish they would allow you to skip an unlimited amount of tracks, esp when your a paid member.it doesn't seem fair to force you to listen to songs you dislike or are not in the mood for.i highly recommend Pandora!"
Pandora,I love Pandora!,Mandee,25-Jul-15,5,"I love Pandora!! It allows me the chance to pick the music style I want to listen to and make a channel that plays similar music. I find new artists that I had never heard of before everyday. If I don't like a song they are playing all I have to do is give it a thumbs down and it disappears from the playlist. I have channels I pick to clean house by, dance to, and just hang out to. Love Pandora!"

Pandora,???,Kayle B.,24-Jun-14,3,"The music is good, the thing is easy to use, there aren't too many radio interruptions, maybe three per hour. The thing I don't like is it asks for your age and gender. Suggestion: put the wrong gender down so if your a man you don't get all of these &#34;single woman&#34; pop up ads and women vise versa."

Pandora,Wonderful,gonefishing,24-Jul-13,5,It's great that Amazon has the Pandora app for the Kindle and Androids.  Getting it from other sources means you can get modified code.  So far I haven't found any Amazon apps that have been bloated or modified.
Pandora,I enjoy Pandora,Rocio,17-Mar-14,4,"I like Pandora Radio, even if it has commercials. I'm able to have several stations. some times it keeps playing music i don't love, but don't hate, but it irritates me after 3/4 song. Now, the advertising has gotten overwhelming the only thing is that Pandora radio is  mostly music and half of the advertising is not heard. I do enjoy the new sleep timer, very convenient."
Pandora,Nice choice of music and channels,Charles,10-Nov-15,5,"Nice choice of music and channels.  However, while using my mobile device I'm asked every few hours if I'm still listening.  At home I'm never asked throughout the day if I'm stlll listening when I use my blue ray player.  I do enjoy the music,  Thank You._Ÿ_¶"

I strongly suggest that if u love music, down load this app I promise u'll love it. The only thing I wish good change would be for the user to be able to replay the whole song instead of just a sample or wait till it comes on again, but otherwise  I love and I hope u love it too!

Pandora,Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream,Keith,10-Nov-14,2,"The latest update has eliminated song lyrics, a HUGE miss.Also, I was paying $36 a year, $3 a month, for Pandora One.  Not a bad price for no ads and a higher quality stream.Now, they want $4.99 a month, a HUGE 166% PRICE INCREASE, with no annual payment option.  Thanks, but no thanks.Given Pandora's limited song repertoire and excessive ads and commercials, it's just not worth it.it's time to move on.  There are better options out there."

I often find music that I had not heard before that quickly become one of my favorites. And I can listen to this great music while working on my laptop, tablet or stream it through our TV. What's not to like?! Thank you, Pandora!"
Pandora,Pandora,holly kopp,18-Jan-14,5,"I chose 5 stars because Pandora provides free music. They have any artists you'd like to listen to and when you create a station you're able to add another artist to play on that same station. You can also like or dislike any song which helps Pandora know what you like. However, if you don't like commercials, then you need to purchase Pandora which I believe is very cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music."
Pandora,Great Progfram,Larry,5-Nov-15,4,"My only problem is the lack of a timer.  I would like to set it to fun for, say. 1/2 hour and then turn off.  Then I could go to sleep to music.

Pandora,Outstanding must-have app,SCT-ESQ,23-Oct-11,5,"I have been a Pandora fan since its very beginning, and had it on each of my BlackBerrys before switching to Android and the Droid Charge. It almost always picks mosaic I love from my seed songs and artists and I can't begin to tally the number of artists I discovered on Pandora.I've tried the copycat services, but they don't even begin to compare to Pandora. I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription. Out is definitely worth the $35 of you listen even a fraction as much as ii do.Out is the only service I pay for other than Sirius, but that isn't really about tykes music."
Pandora,I Do Like This,S&S Consultations,21-Sep-14,4,I listen to music based on my mood. I love the flexibility of how Pandora chooses my music. They play songs that I have long forgot about. I love the troops down memory lane. Thanks!
Pandora,If Only....,N. Devlin,30-Oct-15,4,"I would give it 5 stars but I dont like that you can only skip so many songs per channel and I thought that when you bookmark a song it goes to a folder that you can play at any time. It doesnt though. Other than that, I like it so far. I have only had it for a week."
Pandora,Get it together!,P.Scott,7-Oct-13,1,All I get is a blue screen that says Pandora. That's it. So I'll be going on over to TuneIn Radio. Get it together Pandora -_- ..... Get it together.

Did you also know that if the people that believed the stupid retarted impatient people who rated this app badly because of the adds d not possess this virtue? well its true. the adds are not that long, you can listen to your favorite music and discover different music, and guess what... its all free! the adds are fine they are not that horrible they last like 1 minute to at least 20 seconds. and if you run out of skips just make a new channel that is basically the station you ran out of skips for. please listen to me and use your common sense. This is why I rated Pandora five stars. Sorry for the long post."
Pandora,I give two thumbs up,Marlene Romano,27-Oct-13,3,I give three stars because I have kindle (regular)and when I go on trips I never get to here music so then I will tell give 5stars if u have cellphone  Ok so u want Pandora it's free free music!!!!!

Pandora,Technical difficulties,Bree,20-Jul-16,1,The app constantly tells me everytime I sign in that they are experiencing technical difficulties. I wanted iheartradio however amozon does not have it. I settled for Pandora and at first I loved it now however not so much. I have a kindle fire and it just never wants to work on it.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,8-Nov-16,5,Pandora is so easy to use.  I love that.
Pandora,Most useful application I have ever used!,Pan Vera,8-Jan-15,5,Words cannot describe my joy with Pandora. I am constantly learning about new music I would never hear about otherwise.

Pandora,PandoraOne no Ads but App freezes,joe,30-Nov-12,2,"This review is not about the quality of the music or the ads.  i spend long hours on the computer and i like to have some nice background music.  My dogs like having it as well.I connect it to my stereo for a quick streaming experience.  I used to play it on my iPhone, but then used my fire so i won't need to disconnect every time i got a phone call.The main problem is that the app will stop playing when there is a Ad.  This happens less frwequently with PandoraOne, but still happens each 30 - 40 minutes.  A hassle since i need to turn off the app and then re-launch it.Not sure why this still not fixed."

No need to fix it, if it aint broke:) JUST DO IT!(R)"
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,23-Aug-17,4,ive had pandora longer than amozon and its allways been great
Pandora,"All about those ads, (about those ads) no music",Livi,22-Jul-17,1,"So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone.  I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow.  But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for.  But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad.  I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well.  Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track.  I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing.  In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."
Pandora,Great app!,Art Harrington,22-Nov-14,5,What can I say? Great app!
Pandora,Pandora needs to change limited skip bs,David Pierce,22-Jul-17,2,Its okay. Used to pay for it. Finally stopped paying for it. Supposedly they offer unlimited skips.  Which they said they had before. They still probably don't. Thwy let you skip 5 songs and say sorry we know you're sucker and paid for this but we aren't lerting you hear just what you want. Here are a few songs that are free that suck listen to them. Oh you made a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you'll hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha.
Pandora,pandora,Aline,3-Apr-15,5,Listen to any type of music. Should have this installed in cars
Pandora,Five Stars,me,17-Nov-15,5,nice
Pandora,It would be nice to skip back,Douglas Jerving,3-Dec-15,3,I use Pandora a lot at work. I can skip forward to a new song. It would be nice to skip back. I find it a bit clunky and hard to figure out how to maneuver. Also hard to figure out how to close the program.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,17-Aug-17,5,"Excellent, no commercials, no disc jokeys, no depressing new...just the music I enjoy."

Pandora,I couldn't live without it.,ruby,5-Mar-14,5,I love this app it plays a great mix of music and has way fewer commercials than the radio and I wouldn't be able to make my commute without this app
Pandora,Pandora,Five Zero,14-Jan-14,2,"I like the variety of music Pandora has to offer, but do not like the fact you're limited to how many times you can zip through songs within a specified amount of time.  I also find, at times, it takes several minutes to log on to Pandora. When I want to listen to my music, I want it to be NOW, not later.  Thus the reason for my two star rating."
Pandora,Love It!,T. Robertson,22-Jul-12,5,"Do you hear commercials when listening to free local radio? Of course, so why all the complaining? There are a few more commercials than before, but not that many and far less than local radio, and you can pay to have none at all.  You can get a great varity by entering you favorite artist, then choose some preset stations and choose shuffle all stations.  And the best thing is my car stereo has bluetooth and I listen to pandora with my phone and it plays through the stereo, I've had very few lost connections with 3G and rarely have songs cut off like others have said, but it does happen on occasion.  I also play it on my home computer.  Its free and I love it."

Pandora,Pandora is great,A Renae Blackburn,26-Mar-14,5,"I like being able to pick my own music and listen to the artists I grew up with.  It is great being able to play just the kind of music I like and the commercials are very few.  The app also plays longer than the Pandora does on my computer.  There I have to keep going and indicate I am still listening.  I like that I don't have to rush over and hit the Yes, I am still listening."
Pandora,your own music channel,Keri E,26-Oct-13,5,"We love Pandora. We create our own channel by giving  song a thumbs up or down. They program ""learns"" what you like and will start to play the songs and artists you like. You can make multiple channels so you can switch between genre whenever you like. The kids even have a kid friendly channel.  We did go commercial free on ours. Just personal choice there."
Pandora,love this app,J. Abramczyk,31-Dec-12,5,"I use pandora ALL THE TIME. great music, lots of variety. seems like your channels get more crazy the more channels you have. for example, christian rock started showing up on my coheed and cambria station after i added  a b. reith channel. its kind of neat, but sometimes a bummer because channels can start to sound the same after a while. you do have an ad's free option if you purchase a yearly subscription with pandora."

Pandora,"Great for they gym, poolside, or anywhere else you want to read sometimes and listen to music others",Jack H,26-Sep-16,5,"This is great for listening to your playlists at the gym. I usually switch back and forth between reading and listening to music when I'm on the treadmill at the gym. With Pandora, I can do both with just my Fire tablet.All your Android devices can have the same Pandora settings, or you can create a different account for your Fire and have a different music mix."

Pandora,Pandora is great.  c:,SSS,12-Aug-13,5,"I absolutely love this radio. It plays tons of similar tracks that are exactly what i want to listen to. I would recommend it for some one who is more open minded about music, not as specific because it doesnt always play the song that you are wanting to hear, however it might play a song that you dont know that could be better. Its great for some one who is wanting to widen their musical horizons."

Pandora,"Great content, bad reliability",Jeremy Howell,24-Aug-15,3,"I love this app and all the music it gives me, that I actually enjoy!

But in the last 2 days when I try to log on it just says &#34;we are experiencing technical difficulties.&#34; I know I entered my email and password right because I wrote it down on a piece of paper, and when you type in a letter it shows up until you type in the next letter. And I entered it at least 15 times. Same with the e-mail minus the hide the letter part."
Pandora,love it!,Amazon Customer,11-Aug-17,5,Great source for all genre's of music.
Pandora,I love it,Awesomness,30-Aug-12,5,"I love pandora app because it has every kind of usic on it and if your in the mood for lets say, country, they have all kinds of country songs, even on the radio. If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and author(s)put you can't pick the song. Pandora doesn't have station either, which I'm thankful for."
Pandora,dont get it! piz read:,country+fashion,23-Nov-12,3,I don't get Pandora available on amazon cause of that you YouTube app were you can download music from YouTube to your amazon tablet or phone with wifi but on Pandora you have to have wifi to even listen to it!!!I prefer the YouTube app over Pandora any day!And I think you will to! So don't install this install the YouTube app!(PS.THE YOUTUBE APP IS TOTALLY FREE NO TRICKS! PS. JUST SEARCH YOUTUBE ITS THE FREE ID ONE) (PPS.HOPE YOU LIKE THE YOUTUBE APP!)

Pandora,"bugs., usually its a good app",Amazon Customer,23-Dec-15,2,"My Pandora won't play on my Kindle Fire. I know that Pandora ids usually one of the best music radios that let you customize what you want to hear. However, this time it was poorly excuted on my tablet"
Pandora,not that good,martin robinson,29-Apr-16,1,I dont really like the app.it doesnt give me music I want it putsusic like that I really recommend getting spotify Ii lets u get the music u want
Pandora,Music Lover's Dream!,Bhatta's Reviews,28-Feb-12,5,Pandora App on Kindle Fire works like a charm!. Love the interface and Pandora's way of recommendations of music I listen to. I can see the Album Art and details about the artists. Streaming quality is pretty good.FYI - The pop-up Advertisements are there (Apart from regular Ads between songs randomly) as this is the 'free' version of the App and it bothers me at times as I cannot Skip tracks when Ads are present but I can live with that for now knowing that it is a free Application.I also like that you can let Pandora stream music in the background while I do other things on Kindle Fire. It is a nice way listen to music when you are connected to Wi-Fi.

Pandora,amazon Tap - Alexa is amazing and so much fun.  She can answer almost anything with a clear and concise comment.  I,Marsha Hillhouse,22-Dec-16,5,I love Pandora Media.  It is one of only a few stations that plays Oldies but Goodies music for us senior citizens.

Pandora,Pandora,Mag,21-Feb-14,4,"Pandora is a fine service, but I hardly ever use it, as I have too much music and media around my house.  There's no time to be into all of it too often."
Pandora,"This app is so awesome, I was at a cookout with family and ...",Kathy,17-Jul-14,5,"This app is so awesome, I was at a cookout with family and no one thought to bring music and luckily I had my Kindle Fire HD and downloaded Pandora. Instant music and the fun really began. Everyone was singing along, dancing, laughing and really enjoying the day. The day was great thanks to Pandora !"
Pandora,My favorite music app,Debra Douglass,19-Sep-16,5,I have used this for about 3 years. I just tried Spotify and deleted it after 10 minutes! This app is soooo superior. The premium is the BEST and well worth the price.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,19-Apr-17,5,Love my music
Pandora,"Great, except wanting to listen to one artist only.",Ravenkeeper,9-Mar-14,4,"The only thing I wish Pandora would do is if I want to listen to a certain group, band or artist, it would only play that artist and NOT artists like them."
Pandora,"Awesome, but ...........",Emily,29-Sep-13,4,"I liked this app a lot. It is great for listening to music on a mobile device and it stays signed in to your account. My only problem with it is that it picks songs for you based on the station you create on it. You can't actually pick the song itself, so there are some songs you don't like on it. Pandora learns what you like and don't like by you giving the song a thumbs up or down. Overall, it's a great app. I would have given it 5 stars if you could pick the song!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,22-Oct-16,5,I love Pandora and listen only to Pandora.
Pandora,Seesh...read the review.,Tom Ward,28-Jul-17,2,"I got email asking for 6 month trial for the top of the line super duper (where when you ask for a song, you actually get that song) - and it doesn't work that way on my lap top, and it didn't convert to my phone/tablet - I now get advertisements for the same thing there.  How many $9.99's do they want from me?"
Pandora,Amazing free music app,Brad Mac,4-Aug-12,5,"I don't know what to say that probably hasn't alreadt been said in praise of PANDORA on mommy KindleFire. Name an artist and voila, you have a ""station "" that will deliver tunes by that artist and similar artist. One caveat, if you listen a lot (and I do) you will soon recognize the limit to the tunes by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually these will be the songs you would expect on a ""greatest hits "" album and often that is exactly where they come from.But hey, if you get bored with the repeats,  quickly create a new station.This app can't. Be beat for a source of tunes for your KindleFire or other aneroid device."

It will stop mid song and move on another, or it will just stop playing and you have exit and start again. I could tolerate it if these instances were few and far between, but they're not, and once they start happening they keep happening.That's not to say you shouldn't use it, because let's face it for free music listening it's pretty much your only option, but know that you are at some point going to be yelling at your phone over it."

I created a couple of station and it's amazing how it plays the songs I want to hear.Just make sure to 'like' the songs you want while they are playing and with time the station will be very accurate playing the songs related to that station.

Pandora,Great at Sticking to Genre but Too Many Commercials,slim83,25-Oct-13,3,"I've switched over to iTunes Radio for the most part but still use Pandora for the kids on the morning drive to school. Pandora does the best job at sticking to your specific genre selection (kids, halloween, 4th of July) than any other streaming service out there.

Pandora,Good product (could use a few less ads),-G-,15-Jul-13,4,"I undersand that ads are what makes it free, which is why it is still a four star, but a new add every time you skip, or change station, as well as every three or four songs seems a little much.  Interface is pretty good.  If you add enough variety the stations do an decent job of fitting your tastes.  Eats up data if you are not on a wifi network, but that is to be expected."

Pandora,"Love Pandora, but...",Glowyrm,21-Aug-13,3,"Of course Pandora is great, but after one song plays, I have to unlock my phone and wait for the next song to load, or rather, a commercial and then the next song. Kind of inconvenient. And many more commercials than the regular version of Pandora. I don't mind listening to an occasional commercial now and then, but literally every other song is a bit much."
Pandora,Update of Review - Kindle Fire HDX - 06/2014,Adrian B. Dean,29-Nov-12,3,"Below, you will find my old review for how the App worked on my first gen Kindle Fire. With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.***Old Review 2012***This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. It's part of the reason why I don't subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they don't seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.Update (Same day): So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I've changed the rating to reflect this.Another Update (Same day): So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall won't fix this. I'll reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!"
Pandora,must get this app,Cynthia,24-Feb-15,5,Love this app great music many stations to choose from
Pandora,Three Stars,Lenny A.,12-Jun-17,3,Overall happy but I do hope they allow for more skips for non paying subscribers.

Pandora,Surprised by the low reviews,sandy4964,28-Apr-12,5,"I finally loaded the Pandora app the other day on advise from my daughter. After reading lots of bad an so - so reviews, I was skeptical, but didn't think my college student would steer me wrong.I created a variety of stations among different genres and have beenvery happy with all my choices and most of Pandora's too. I haven't had to give many thumbs down. Even stations I've created that I thought would be just to try out, have become some of my faves!The brief commercial breaks aren't a problem at all.If you are on the fence like I was at first, give it a try, I believe you will get addicted like I have."

Pandora,Very happy,Chris A. Johnson,28-Dec-12,4,"It is so handy and generally good that I wonder what I did before this was around.  I less frequently listen to my recorded music now.  The items I would suggest be added are less of a criticism than ways to improve the service.  Of course one limitation is that not all past and present music is included in their library. That is a major issue and one I know the folks at Pandora are constantly trying to mitigate by signing new contracts. Cache would be nice, on par with Slacker.  Other than that I think they are doing things right and will be around for a very long time."
Pandora,Personal heart-warming radio station,Annette J. Teixeira,25-Apr-14,5,"Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear.  By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, (or group of artists) - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre.  Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our  mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves.  Best of all it's free."

Pandora,Pandora the app that used to be great,new puzzeler,15-Aug-13,3,I was introduced to Pandora by a friend and fell in love with it. I constantly listened to music on it.  then one day I was cleaning my room and had been listening for a while then an artist that I do NOT like came on I tried to dislike it but the song continuedbto to play so I tried to skip it but I had already used the 6 skips in one hour the app is a great idea yet very expenseive and sucks battery I would have made this a five star review yet I just couldn't because if all the troubles I've had with this app.

Pandora,What would I do without it?,book adict,29-Jan-13,5,It works great on my Droid.  I love that it will play my favorite artist and then suggest other artists that have a similar sound.  I have been able to find new artists that I love using this.

Even a 69 year old grandma can set it up!"
Pandora,LOVE PANDORA!,A. Guerich,14-Aug-16,5,"My stations are available where ever I go! I have a quiet instrumental station for my classroom, oldies for me, mariachi for taco night, Neil Diamond for my heart, praise and worship for my spirit, Raffi for sing alongs...LOVE PANDORA!"
Pandora,Horrible,Melissa Hinson,28-Apr-14,1,"Pandora is the most anti-consumer, anti-artist radio service the world has ever known. Here are a few highlights you can expect with your Pandora player:1. very few songs played over and over and over and over again2. only run the player on one device at a time3. extremely expensive for what you get - spend the $36 a year on 36 single downloads and you'll have more variety and better quality.DON'T USE PANDORA!"

Pandora,I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music,Jack Belden,25-Oct-15,2,"I have listened to Pandora for years and enjoyed the music.  Recently, however, it appears that the listener is being pushed away from free listening toward the premium pay listening.I receive about 80% of a song before Pandora switches to another song.  Very annoying.I am switching to another alternative."

Pandora,Five Stars,DOROTHY BACKMAN,23-Oct-16,5,It's just great
Pandora,Music to go.,vulforge,14-Oct-13,5,"Pandora creates ""stations"" of music similar to any artist you submit.  ""Peter Gabriel"" for instance will create a station of music by that artist and others Pandora deems similar such as Pink Floyd and Sting.  This can be a good way to discover music you like but might not have heard yet.  It is well worth paying the upcharge for Premium service to get rid of the commercials."
Pandora,ok app if you have the time,DJacenixon83,12-Feb-15,3,I don't use it any more but it is free music
Pandora,I am not to pleased.,Sydney whitesitt,6-Jun-14,3,"When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."

While I have an existing accout with them, I like to have the choice as to whether or not I include them in my day to day life.  If you are going to mine my data, at least be subtle about it.This will cause me to use your product less, rather than more.  Thank You,  Karl Kunkel"

Pandora,5 Thumbs Up!!,Wendy Lynch,29-Jun-14,5,I love music and Pandora provides me with music that I like. It also exposes me to music that I've never heard before which turns me on to musicians and bands that I wouldn't ordinary hear that I end up liking. It provides an avenue that I can somewhat steer towards the music that appeals to me. I listen to Pandora on a daily basis and have for a few years now. 5 thumbs up for Pandora! Thanks!

Pandora,Pandora,d. Benyo,30-Jun-13,3,It's popular but only streams at 192kbps.  Mog and Spotify have it beat by le a long margin by streaming at 320kbps.  There is a noticeable difference in sound quality.

So far I've listed over 15 different ""styles"" and use her ""shuffle"" feature so that I'm never bored with the same tract line-up.Pandora is easy to customize and user-friendly, especially for this techno-challenged user.  Kudos to Pandora's creators!"
Pandora,Enjoy listening,Debra J Walls,26-Sep-15,3,"I enjoy listening but I've looked around after ""liking"" quite a few songs I can't figure out how to make my own station. I suspect that is a pay for service.  I don't listen to music on my devices because of battery like."
Pandora,Easy to Use and Works Great,Bill,13-Sep-15,5,"Downloaded and installed quickly and easily on my Kindle Fire. Already use Pandora on my PC and smart Blue Ray players, so I already have an account and personalized stations set up. Pandora is a real pleasure to listen to.

Pandora,I'm a Pandora One fan...,The Ayres,4-Oct-13,4,"We have instances of this service running on iPad, Android, Samsung Smart TV, and several Windows operating system computers.  I'll put it on the nearest sound system quite frequently, and the most recent download, the one for my Samsung Galaxy IV lets me plug into the radio on my truck and play quite good audio on the go.  So far, this has not made a big dent in my monthly allotment of gigabytes of download over Verizon, in part because most of the time I use it on devices attached to my home network either via Ethernet or wirelessly that are served by high speed cable based internet service."
Pandora,... prod you to step up to paying they stream good music for the most part,John Burris,1-Dec-14,5,"Besides the fact that they get you in then prod you to step up to paying they stream good music for the most part. New artists or seldom heard artists are appreciated when they get your taste in music down and I have a quite a diverse taste in music, the tunes roll in."
Pandora,Technical Difficulties.............constantly.,Teresa,27-Oct-15,3,"This is a great app WHEN it's working.

Pandora,problem loading,thaicracka,27-Dec-13,2,I was excited to see that Pandora was available for my kindle hd after being an avid user on my pc.  I have become very disappointed with this app because of a constant loading issue.  It will work a couple of times then it won't load.  I've deleted/downloaded this app so many times it's becoming a chore.  Please fix this!  Don't make me go back to iheart radio!
Pandora,Good Music!,Happy,9-Oct-15,5,Pandora is Great! I love all the variety of music it has.
Pandora,It's free... but the ads increased,C. Rolley,19-Feb-13,3,"I remember listening to Pandora and hearing an ad every 3 or 4 songs, now it seems as tho it's 2 songs, then an ad.  If I JUST had an ad, skip a song, it has an ad again.  Annoying, but, it's free.  As for the songs, I'm a fan of Industrial music and it seems as tho Pandora only plays songs by 6 or 7 different bands.  I KNOW there are more Industrial bands out there!  It serves it's purpose, it keeps my niece dancing on bad days, but the amount of ads is getting insane.  It isn't driving me to upgrade, it's driving me to find another service."

They still had my email but I couldn't remember my password (its been at least a year) and thought I clicked on ""forgot my password"" I haven't heard back.  I'II"
Pandora,A great value of entertainment and serendipitous listening joy.,Brian A. Webb,7-Feb-14,5,"Pandora is a joy to use and an incredible value for free (with ads) or for a small monthly fee (ad-free). I love that I can create multiple ""stations"", specify a few artists to ""focus"" the programming, and just sit back and enjoy the surprising and almost always spot-on results. A refreshing change from my downloaded albums, annoying commercial radio, and horribly repetitive satellite broadcast options.  Love Pandora!  Thank you.  Pandora."
Pandora,A great music listening tool.,Cheryl Miles,6-Apr-15,5,"I have Pandora on my laptop and my TV and truly enjoy listening to the genres of music that I select directly and indirectly on my ""stations.""

Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I don't want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic!

Pandora,I really like Pandora as you can find a station based on ...,J. Dring,12-Apr-15,5,"I really like Pandora as you can find a station based on your artist.  If you give the thumbs up for songs, they tend to play them and others like it more often.  The commercials are fine and not very long so they aren't really a problem.  I like that you can also purchase a song that is on as well right from the app. Would definitely recommend it."
Pandora,Pandora App,Jean Weisert,7-Oct-15,4,Link via iPhone or Kindle Fire. Sometimes a lengthy pause between selections but that is probably the Time Warner internet connection. Fidelity is enhanced by linking iPhone or Kindle Fire via a Bluetooth speaker. Comparable to Prime Music although Prime Music is better in that I can access my playlists

Pandora,A Great Music App,Donna F. Tarver,9-Jun-14,5,I love Pandora and have been using it for years on my laptop and iPhone. It's best feature for me is the ease of accessing such a wide variety of music from every era and from many artists sometimes new ones that I have not been familiar with.

Pandora,wish I knew of this earlier!,capuccino,7-Sep-13,5,"I got the free version of Pandora and am loving this Pandora music experience, I listen to music via Pandora rather than the radio now because it is able to select music that I like.  I can give it thumbs up or thumbs down to each music and Pandora will remember my preference."
Pandora,Internet Radio,John Skeene,21-Jul-14,5,"l like this app because it provides all my old school rock and heavy metal. You can create your own stations on any music you like and publish them for the community. What I really like is you get a bio about the artists you choose to hear. And it's really interesting on how they were formed, played together and made history. Pandora will select the song for you based on the genre you select. Great App."
Pandora,The best music ever!,Lisa K.,13-Jan-14,5,"Pandora has the largest collection of music on the web. I love how you can customize your stations and the service can adapt to your preferences. The commercials are short on the free service and not too obtrusive. I have had few technical problems and I use it on my computer, Kindle and cell phone. I have a BA in Musicology and I sincerely love this service as it reminds me of all the great music I studied in college."

Their addition of commercials takes away from the enjoyment.  I take advantage of the free music.  Probably, if I paid for it, the commercials would go away."
Pandora,almost perfect but needs just a little bit more,jerry winfield,4-Dec-13,5,"this app is great. it runs smoothly and is just all out awesome. I deffinitly recommend Pandora one but buy that nonlinear ratherthen on your device. it only gives you the per month payment option when the per year option is a better deal. The one thing it needs is more ways to sort stations like by genre or have a favorites bar, or playlists. that is what would make it even better then now. I hope people can understand what I'm saying. anyways, that's it!!"
Pandora,ads ruin it.,supafiya,6-Aug-12,3,"I don't really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc. I don't want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around. the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing, you cant close them! the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you'd clicked on the ad itself. I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app."
Pandora,Great music,Ponch,6-Feb-15,4,Sometimes this shows you bands/music you've never given a chance.  Turns you onto new stuff while listening
Pandora,Works Well,1Sunbum,23-Jan-14,5,"I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"
Pandora,Love the options to choose from,Donna M Dickinson,3-Feb-16,5,Love the options to choose from. I was mainly looking for some relaxtion music & was surprized to find the different type of music out there to choose from. I love it!

Pandora,make the switch!,christopher,20-May-14,3,"Switch to Spotify! You can download fave songs to listen while on the road/etc. without burning up data!! Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive, ex. gives suggestions for different stations, singers, etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"
Pandora,Music......,Fred Adelman,30-Jan-13,5,"........that you have no control over. If you like Rock, Country, Electronica, Pop, etc, you pick the category and the songs begin to play. You cannot tell the app what songs you would like to hear. In other words, this works just like radio stations that plays genres of music that you like. You may not like the song that is currently playing, so you can switch to another station or just wait for the song to end and hope the next tune is something you like."

Pandora,Does this app not work on Kindles?,Herman Sutter,6-Jan-16,2,"This app freezes up if we add a new station. Then when I reinstall it, it freezes up after playing one song. I have reinstalled the program four times in one day.  It works fine on my ipad, but not on my Kindle fire.  Is it me or a problem with the app and the Kindle?"
Pandora,choosing music,Sue,20-Aug-13,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to set up a station with my favorite artists!  I am a country fan and while I enjoy all the different artists, I have ones that I really love and Pandora allows me to listen to them more often. I haven't explored all the options but am enjoying learning and listening. Thank you!"
Pandora,Good. But not on the new Kindle Fire.,Wyatt,22-May-16,3,"Couldn't get it to work on my new Kindle Fire. I really like Pandora and the amount of music you can listen to, but I'd be better off using my computer or phone t use it."
Pandora,Customized listening,starborne,14-Nov-13,5,"I get exactly the music I want with Pandora's ability for the user to choose their own ""stations"" and listen to their favorites, as well as the regular broadcasts."
Pandora,Most Helpful,Timothy Nelson,2-May-14,5,"I started listening to Pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists I picked, they would point me to artists I had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection. I will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard."
Pandora,It's like the songs that come on they instantly know what ...,Troy Grate,11-May-16,5,I always had an Pandora account & I recently went back to it. It's like the songs that come on they instantly know what I like to listen to.GREAT APP!!!
Pandora,MOSTLY ANNOYING,J. STEVENSON,28-Apr-17,3,"I don't care for Pandora for this reason;  You create a station with an artist.  I thought I would only be listening to that particular artist.Unfortunately, Pandora takes it upon themselves to add other artists that they consider to be of the same genre.  I am passionate about my music and I resent having a computer tell me what to listen to.  For instance, I may want to listen to Bob Dylan only, there are a few Dylan songs and then suddenly I'm listening to Bruce Springsteen.  Can't stand that.  I would like to pick my own music which is why I stick with ITunes."
Pandora,I love pandora but.....,awesome,20-Sep-15,3,"When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."
Pandora,My only wish is that I could turn it on ...,Holly,7-Jan-15,5,My only wish is that I could turn it on and leave it on all day instead of having it cut out and wait for me to notice.
Pandora,awwesome,k.walls,3-Sep-16,4,i love pandora being able to listen to all of my favorite artist its awesome. i dont like how oi have to listen to the same commercials everytime i hear an advertisement its the same one over and over again
Pandora,Music maker...,Charles Davidson,13-Jan-13,4,"I love pandora for it's innovative and versatile service's they provide in their program. I love being able to create my own station's, music I want to hear the music I grew up on. Thank's Pandora, Your Awesome..."
Pandora,A music lovers dream app,Richard Welling,9-Jan-14,5,This app is designed for the true music lover.  Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up.  You program the music you want by artist and Pandora takes it from there by providing that artist as well as like-sounding artist.  So you can discover other interesting artists you may not be familiar with or have heard their latest music.
Pandora,Pandora is such a pleasure for anyone to enjoy. It doesn't matter what type of music you ...,Amazon Customer,28-Mar-15,5,"Pandora is such a pleasure for anyone to enjoy.  It doesn't matter what type of music you or I enjoy because it's available for our enjoyment.  From easy listening for me to what ever is your choice, it's always available.  What more could you ask."
Pandora,Pandora praise.,Norma Lovett,18-Sep-17,5,"We absolutely love Pandora.  It is great while reading, talking in the living room with family and friends and just to relax. A good tension reliever. Oh yes, enjoyable music with good choices of performers."

Pandora,Pandora,Eric Elliott,26-Sep-17,4,"Easy selection, decent collection.  I would like some more songs because occasionally there is repetition."
Pandora,the best music app!,Lee,31-Dec-12,5,"Pandora, choose your station. Customize the station. buy the music. share the song with a link. the lyrics can even be looked at on some songs. don't like the song, thumbs down. or you can move the song to somewhere else. i like the commercials. i have the free pandora. any station, clean, explicit. doesn't matter and pandora tells you if you are listening to the clean version of any song.music and comedy. something for every age. must have. i have this on my kindle fire. i find that this works very well indeed."
Pandora,Great!,I Like Cats,16-Nov-14,4,"This is a very good app. I can listen to ridiculous music like the Goofy Goober Song, to real music you'd hear on the radio, to music from the Harry Potter movies! The only problem is if I use it while playing Minecraft, my Kindle either shuts down or glitches badly."
Pandora,What a GREAT app.,Sarah P.,16-Mar-13,5,"I have gotten many apps for my kindle and my ipod touch but, I have never found an app that I enjoy as much as I enjoy Pandora!!I go and pick the music I want and just sit and listen to my hearts content. Thank you so much for this app. I have my own radio stations and no commercials to interrupt my music. A must for everyone on every computer, kindle, tablet, phone etc. Can't say enough."
Pandora,"""THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES""",Mark Dunning,29-Dec-14,5,"Absolutely awesome, I lke almost all generes of music, but the blues are my favorite. Recently I heard of this site from my son, I'm like a kid with a new toy. Thank you so much, for having set this up for those that have a common love of music. Keep the ""great work ""  Mark D.  NY..."
Pandora,Such a let down. ..not the service...just the licenses.,megan l parker,29-Oct-14,1,I can't believe they let me download this app when it isn't even available in the UK. As soon as I opened it it has a warnine screen saying it is not available in the UK. And I LOVE Pandora don't get me wrong. But it was a big letdown after getting my hopes up that I would finally be able to get Pandora in the UK. Total bummer.
Pandora,There really is a free lunch (of music).,Caroljean K. Rodesch,27-Dec-14,5,"Utterly incredible I can get all the music in all the genres for free. How come now one ever told me this before.. no more messing around with iTunes or cranky ipod down load... its on my computer and even better on my kindle. Easy app to get.. did nor need SS#, blood type name of first grade teacher or prom date top get... Stunning, amazing, I love it"
Pandora,perfect except....,Angel Hollingsworth,19-May-14,4,"I love Pandora and how you can create your own stations and a million different kinds. The only thing I wish you could also select would be soundtracks. There are so many soundtracks I'd love to listen too, even if there were similar soundtracks thrown in. A little trickier than a genre or artist but not impossible.No complaints otherwise."
Pandora,Main Problem......now fixed!,J. Sut,19-Feb-17,5,"I really enjoy Pandora, daily, with all my favorite radio stations.  I love the Shuffle feature!  My biggest complaint is that it pops on at any time without clicking on it. This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD 8, which I have to Shut Down when I leave because Pandora may come on and use up all the battery. I do not sign out to end the music, only ""Quit"" because it's very difficult to sign in.  I don't know if this is a Pandora problem or a Kindle problem.Update  4-16-17: After the recent Pandora update, this problem has finally been fixed!  Much improvement with this last update, too."
Pandora,... music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!,Lee Lee,9-Apr-15,5,So many music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!!
Pandora,LOVE!!,Mountain Mama,19-Apr-14,4,It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!
Pandora,Great music,Charmar97,30-Nov-12,5,Pandora has a great selection of music that can be listened to anywhere.  It also allows you to create your own stations and then scramble them to get a wide variety of music.
Pandora,Five Stars,Eileen Mooney,23-Aug-17,5,Great!!
Pandora,I truly appreciate and enjoy listening to Pandora,Amazon Customer,4-Dec-16,5,I truly appreciate and enjoy listening to Pandora. Please keep it free radio. My love goes to the crew. Thank you! bjs
Pandora,Be a sport and spring for the premium account.,A. Johnson,19-Nov-11,5,"I've been reading waaay too many whines from kids who don't like the commercials. THERE'S AN ANSWER, CHEAPOS. Pay a piddling amount for a year of commercial-free Pandora and help the company stay afloat. You'll also get a great-quality stream. The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that (a)  they can't find the advertisers and (b) they haven't burned through their capital yet. Meanwhile, NOBODY beats Pandora's Music Genome algorhythm at sussing out new music you'll love. They're easily best in breed. FIVE STARS. Try it and if you love it but hate the ads, pay the piper. You won't be sorry."
Pandora,I like how is personalizes the stations,Amazon Customer,16-May-16,4,"I like how is personalizes the stations, and I love thumbprint station, but I hate how it limits skips and dislikes one the free version. Also the adds are annoying."
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Leslie,11-Dec-16,5,Love Pandora!! Can listen to my music on any device and in even in my car or on TV with DirectTV!
Pandora,Excellent,Cat,8-May-17,5,I can listen to the music I like. I like to listen to music when I am heading to work.  I just put on my headphones and listen to somethingrelaxing.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,3-Oct-17,5,Love it!
Pandora,User friendly.,Kindle Customer,18-Dec-16,5,A real treasure. Wonderful selections that set the mood and allow the listener to get lost in the music.
Pandora,music lover,akinr2d2,9-Nov-17,5,my favorite way to listen to music now.
Pandora,I truly enjoy the hands off approach to music,Amazon Customer,19-May-16,5,"I truly enjoy the hands off approach to music.  I am a musician and love the selection of tracks, especially those from bands I have never heard before.  great idea, keep up the great work."
Pandora,Best Thing Since Sliced Bread,Debra McCarthy,22-Oct-14,5,Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread. Being able to customize my music choices is fabulous. No bummer music. No out-of-sync songs with my listening mood. My musical tastes are wide ranging but I hold high standards when it comes to listening to any genre. Pandora provides a way to get the best of the best. Gotta love that!
Pandora,would like it's own app instead of going thru amazon app,margaret anderson,27-Dec-14,2,"Not familiar enough with the phone yet, but 1. would like it's own app instead of going thru amazon app, 2. too many ad's, 3. too many suggested 'other' music I might like, 4. choosing other songs by an artist vs. just what they want to highlight, 5. Music does not stop when I turn off my phone, and 6. not easy or friendly or simple to navigate around the Amazon/Pandora app."
Pandora,Great for the Most Part,Adrian James,28-Feb-14,4,"You can't complain about the price, but I would like it so much better if you didn't choose other artists for me, or if you would at least allow me to weed them out.  The best I can do is drop 1 song at a time, and that just isn't adequate.  Most of the music you offer, however, is really great, so I gave you the 4 stars.Thank you."
Pandora,Great Quality!,Heather Erb,4-Jan-13,5,"I just recently purchased the Pandora app since I have a Pandora account that I have been using on traditional computers.  Pandora will continue to play in the background even if the app is not open and you are working on other things.  In addition, I started to watch a movie trailer while Pandora was playing.  Pandora actually muted itself while the trailer was playing and picked back up right when the trailer was over.  I didn't have to do anything!  What a smart and convenient app!"
Pandora,Four Stars,Doug Hall,21-Aug-17,4,Ok
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,5-Apr-17,4,Great music!!
Pandora,PANDORA,Jane Oliver,10-Feb-17,5,I really love it. I got Pandora for my husband and he is very happy with the music that he selected.
Pandora,Pandora,Laura Ellen,10-Jul-13,3,"Thought it was free music? Not. I guess nothing much is free (apps)on the Kindle fire, but I'll deal with it."
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,17-May-17,4,"I'm using it, but I don't know how."
Pandora,Pandora couldn't fix the problem!,Dave,12-Jun-15,1,Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone.  I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working.  I contacted them and they are unable to figure-out what is wrong.  I am cancelling my service and going with another provider.
Pandora,Pandora,rosemarie hannan,16-Feb-14,1,I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password.  I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora.  Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod
Pandora,Wonderful!,Turtle,13-Oct-12,5,"I always have and always will love the services Pandora provides. I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)! And the way Pandora is set up for my Kindle Fire HD is far superior to the application on my iTouch. This version hardly ever freezes and does not deliver choppy music. I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily."
Pandora,Pandora works for me,Andrew Wilson,10-Jan-14,4,I enjoy using Pandora and I encourage everyone to down load this for free app for the inter net ENJOY!

Pandora,Not understanding the bad reviews,M.Cole,9-Sep-12,5,"Pandora is honestly really great. I've literally been using it for a solid 6 months straight, it's that good. And I don't get these reviews saying that commercials interrupt the songs, cuz they don't. You'll get like one commercial every 3 or 4 songs with little pop up ads. while listening. And since my kindle's on lock most of the time when I'm listening, or since I'm doing other things like playing games or on the web, it doesn't matter cuz I cant see the ads. I like this app a whole lot, and ill probably be a loyal fan for years."
Pandora,"great app, odd skipping problem",Amazon Customer,7-Jan-12,4,"this app does its job: delivers the Pandora experience on kindle fire.  free tunes customized the say you like without having to micromanage your playlist.i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads,  but I really cant get upset about that for free music.  would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour.one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up.  hopefully they'll fix this with an update.  but for this, would give five stars."
Pandora,Amazing,scaryspice,8-Sep-15,5,This app is so amazing I would recommend it to everyone free music and it's just amazing.
Pandora,I love being able to customize my music,Michael O'Connell,3-Dec-15,5,"I love being able to customize my music. Pandora is very easy to use, and you can skip a song if your not sure you want it or not at the time it first plays. Makes for great variety on road trips"
Pandora,Awesome app,Amazon Customer,22-Aug-17,5,Love how you can add to or create a channel to fit your preferences.

Pandora,Wouldn't even let me make an acount!,Amazon Customer,27-Dec-13,1,"So I downloaded the app on my new phone, happy because my sister had it on her phone. So I clicked on ""make an acount"" and I put in all the information that I needed and clicked ""make acount"" a second later a message popes up saying ""thank you! But sadly we can not accept your a application at this time"" I've tried over and over again but it still happens ever time!"
Pandora,Five Stars,guy odom sr,2-Jun-16,5,greatest music selection available.
Pandora,used to love it,mdeezy,8-Jan-16,2,I love this app and would love it more. But lately it won't play any station on my tablet regardless of the upgrades or not... I use the lullaby stations to help my son sleep at night plz fix

Pandora,I would like if better if I was smarter on the e-thing,Taxmebaby,25-Mar-14,3,I just don't understand how it works and how to make it work for me.  The preset selections seem to be good enough.
Pandora,its okay,Pamela,23-May-13,3,it keeps coming on by itself and I am not sure why. The song choices are not aways my favorite. I wish I had more control of that but it is nice to have music i don't have to buy.
Pandora,Four Stars,Kindle Customer,13-Jan-15,4,Difficult changing stations.

Pandora,Good selection of music,JW,4-Nov-14,4,"Good selection of music. Not always easy to see how it works on other devices, but very easy on my Kindle."
Pandora,Wow!!!,Jan Thomas,9-Oct-15,5,"Wow, what a nice free service!!  I can't believe I just discovered this thanks to my son!!  I love the music and can change it, give thumbs up and thumbs down to the ones I wish!  This is the next best thing to the invention of the remote!  Love, love it!!!!"
Pandora,I just enjoy the convenience of it,Amazon Customer,7-Jun-16,5,I just enjoy the convenience of it.  I can also leave it on while I'm away from the house for a few hours - it's nice to hear music in the house when I come home.
Pandora,Two Stars,joseph brooks,18-Sep-17,2,Bad connection..keep losing the connection..continuous buffering
Pandora,The pinnacle of relaxation.,Ken of the House of Darcy,20-Jun-14,5,This app provided me with a source of peace. I just set a time limit and zone out on the sofa. I love switching in between my selected genres without having to worry about being stuck with an unpleasant song. I can either skip it or dislike it. It is also great for when I'm doing other stuff. I just turn it on and put it off to the side whilst I work. I thoroughly enjoy this app.
Pandora,I like Pandora a lot!,Rocky,24-Mar-13,5,"Excellent ap. I can play the music I like and thumbs down the ones I don't.Can't say anything negative about it. The ads are sometimes a pain, but for afree ap, what do you expect?I recommend it to my friends."
Pandora,Five Stars,robin stine,13-Jan-15,5,Great product and service
Pandora,Mixing stations,hdehart,29-Aug-15,5,It's good to have all my old favorites to listen to. I have been a listener for a few years now. The only negative to Pandora is it seems to mix stations with other favorite channels. Such as the B52's and Jethro Tull on the same channel.
Pandora,So thankful to have an awesome music app for my Kindle,Sydney3,12-Sep-17,5,Fabulous as always. So thankful to have an awesome music app for my Kindle. I have Pandora on every device in my house.
Pandora,So such better than it used to be,stephanie,8-Aug-17,5,Easier to use and the playlists I can actually listened to from beginning to the end
Pandora,An Important App,Kameron,25-Sep-12,5,"There's a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none (Fix your device?)This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can't be rid of an entire artist, only a song.From what I've experienced, this is an app that must be had."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-17,5,Grsat choice of music
Pandora,this app is awesome... my only problem with it is...,Depthbolt Silvercharge,4-Jan-14,4,"the pop up advertisements, I feel like I am using NetZero from back around the turn of the Millennium. I understand that if you pay for a subscription that those pop ups go away, but in this day and age people need to save $$$ any way they can, so why pay for something when you can keep the free version and just tap the pop ups away every single time they come up."
Pandora,_Ÿ˜Å,Indiana Quintero,29-Aug-17,5,Excelente
Pandora,Five Stars,Christal W. Clarke,9-Dec-15,5,Pandora needs a back button!
Pandora,Can never go wrong with a free music app,Ed,2-Jan-13,4,"I have this on my both my internet TV and my tablet.  The music choices usually (but not always) stay true to the type of music played by the original artist you've chosen.  Surprised, though, that there is no choice for Beethoven or some of the other Classical greats, but it may be that my search capabilities aren't that great when searching for artists and music.  Even so, it's a great way to add the kind of music you like."
Pandora,Great app,suzy kiker,22-Apr-15,4,"I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music. On the down side you have to pay for add free listening but sometimes the adds aren't even bothering. Overall it is a great app and I recommend it."
Pandora,Pandora,Kathy Dough,21-Feb-15,5,Excellent! Love it.
Pandora,Best music app by far,Danielle Gill,10-Oct-17,5,"Best music app by far! The genres, options and settings are plenty! Easy navigation and almost always plays the music I actually like!"
Pandora,grrrr why does it do this????!!!!!!,CL Wimmer,7-Dec-14,3,"I love Pandora but... it keeps playing songs that don't even relate to me station I'm listening to! So I'm listening to Imagine Dragons raised and I hear Taylor Swift or Paul Cardall!!!! And it only lets me skip songs 5-6 Times an hour on each station!!! This is why I u, Pandora a 3-5!"
Pandora,Awsome app.,Amazon Customer,21-Jun-17,5,"This app is awsone, it keeps track of your favorite music. Thumbprint is awesome and I also injoy shuffle.  Been listening to Pandora for over 5 years now."
Pandora,comes across songs/artist I have never heard of and I end up enjoying,Holly Jones,26-Dec-12,4,"I like that it lets me add several artists to one station so that it gets a better idea of what to suggest.  I don't like that in the beginning while you are ""teaching"" it what you like, you can only fast forward so many times.  And even though you can't go back and listen to a specific artist/album like in Spotify, it's suggestions are still much, much better.  So if I want something possible new mixed in with what I like I use Pandora."
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Kindle Customer,15-Dec-13,5,"I listened for hours several days this week to the Christmas station, hearing wonderful songs, with some suggestions from me, while wrapping gifts and sitting by the fire. I love Pandora's varied choices for me. I am never bored, I often sing along, and if one they choose is not right for my mood at the moment, I can delete it and get another one immediately. The ads are few. And finally, its free!  What's not to like?"
Pandora,awesome just pure awesome,epic gamer 1418,2-Feb-14,5,"I love this app! After you've made a couple stations and have thumb-upped or thumb-downed a bunch of songs, you can just put it on shuffle (which I love) and just relax and listen to music. What I also love about this app is that you can go to your home screen and play games and still listen to music! Which is why it has a 5 star rating from me. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes music!"
Pandora,Three Stars,ToyComicDude,13-Oct-17,3,Needs the replay function added like the iOS version has. Other wise itâ€™s as good as the iOS app

Pandora,The best of the streaming music apps,Gary Hollins,30-Jun-13,4,"I've used Google Play, Music 365, IHeart Radio and Pandora, and I have to give the overall nod to Pandora, even with the ads. If you're looking for stations that actually play the artists you want (assuming that they have a moderately  substantial catalog of at least 30 songs to their credit), you have to use Pandora. The best streaming music service online, and it's free if you don't mind the occasional 15 second ad."
Pandora,Love the fact that I can select the type of ...,betty,27-Jul-16,5,Love the fact that I can select the type of music and it just keeps playing an assortment of the same type of music.
Pandora,Crap I don't want to hear,Amazon Customer,14-May-14,1,When I first discovered Pandora I was ecstatic about being able to hear m favorite songs with nothing else interrupting it. Ony one week and I can't get to my favorites because they are always pushing crappy music into my phone that I can't get rid of unless I shut my phone off and start over.

Pandora,The best option by far,Kindle Customer,11-Oct-14,5,"Pandora has the best stations I've heard so far and their website is wonderful to navigate. You can collect albums and songs from your favorites and they even have stations that are created through your favorite song or artist. I have Pandora on Roku  and enjoy it through my television, computer and Kindle. I love the music.  Music choices seem endless and if you want commercial free and ad free music, the subscription price is amazingly low."

Pandora,I really like Pandora!,Sandra R. Coulson,7-Jun-14,5,I enjoy the unending possibilities of music. I can listen on my own time with my 'own' stations which I have created.I travel and love not being dependent on  a sound system anywhere. It is an answer to television and I feel great for not just wasting time on 'dippy movies'. I can fill my mind with great music!
Pandora,horrible,Davis Family,23-Dec-15,1,When I get on I hit register for free then I do what it tell me what to do then I hit sign in then it tells me. &#34;Thank you for your interest but unfortunately Pandora can't get to you

Pandora,YOU NEED PANDORA!!!,blade,10-Dec-13,5,"Hey you, yes you! listen up!  PANDORA IS A MUST HAVE. I literally live on Pandora.  I play it no matter what I'm doing, it's on. You can personalize your station(s) by clicking the thumbs up. You can create stations by genre of music and the artist. For example, my favorite is Carrie Underwood radio. For any of those musics lover's out there; Get Pandora Now!!! It is amazing. I cant even say anything bad about it!!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,16-Nov-16,5,It's on POINT!
Pandora,Get this if you're a music lover.,L Miller,25-Nov-13,5,"This is a great service. I was slow to com to use this program. But this allows me to choose music I enjoy, especially right now, Christmas music.  Curiously, this version has only occasional ads. The smart  phone app is annoyingly riddled with ads--visual and voiced over. If I had first used that Pandora, I would never have loaded on my Kindle Fire. This is lovely and the ads are a minor annoyance."
Pandora,Great Music Selection,Kathy Brophy,9-Nov-16,5,Love Pandoraâù_ï¸è So many music selections.

Pandora,Good sound,harry,14-Mar-13,5,"Sounds great playing on the Kindle Fire HD, I have used Pandora in the past on my lap top, or Pc."
Pandora,I have deleted Pandora from my Kindle Fire HD.,JAC,2-Nov-13,2,"I started getting political (and other) advertisements that interrupted both my music and any games I was playing. I have not positively isolated the source of these ads. When I do that application will be deleted permanently and I may reload Pandora. I could not skip, stop, or delete these ads except by Shutting Down my Kindle. I am filing a complaint with AMAZON and KINDLE SUPPORT.  I have really liked listening to music on PANDORA that was from my school years. That is why I gave it  two stars. However, I will NOT have any application that includes advertising that is this intrusive on my Kindle."
Pandora,Five Stars,Mariann H.,21-Aug-17,5,Personally care for Pandora more than iHeartRadio. I seem to be the minority.

Pandora,SarRev- Pandora Review,Sarah Kalene,16-Feb-14,5,"-I am SarRev, I review all hot or interesting apps.-Pandora is the best thing since sliced bread! Sometimes it plays songs we don't like or know, but, it is meant to introduce us to different songs and our likes. So sometimes that might no be so convenient for us, but, Pandora can't read our minds. This app works great, it plays (mostly) your favorite music, and I HIGHLY recommend it!"
Pandora,Excellent service!,David Hall,12-Jan-14,5,"I find Pandora media service to be my most used app on my smartphone. I can listen to ""Classical Study"" while I read, do projects and study online or at my desk. I find it helpful that Pandora feeds me with so many different selections, I never get bored. It is like a radio station just for my style.Sincerely,  David Hall"

Pandora,avd,and123,15-Apr-15,4,Pandora is a great app it lets me pick the station I want to listen to and has great music but the only down side I see to this is that you need WiFi access but if it didn't needed WiFi it would be a good seller over all this is a great app : )

Pandora,Doesn't really play what you want,Nancy Castro,2-Jan-13,3,"I really enjoy listening to music and I like the idea that you could chose the artist you want to listen to. However, if I type a specific artist I hate the fact that you listen to one of their songs and then a different artist comes on. They don't play the songs from the artist you choose consistently. They'll play one song but then go to a different artist and then back to your artist....I don't really care for that style. If I put in Prince, I only want to listen to his music...."
Pandora,The Best For This Classical Music Lover,Scientist,7-Aug-15,4,"I've tried most of the streaming music apps and this one works best for me and my preference for classical music.  My only complaint would be that it tends the treat ""new age"" and classical music as the same.  They are very different."
Pandora,Five Stars,Linda Frazier,10-Dec-16,5,Its great to set up Pandora on cell phone and still access TV for show watching.Good music.
Pandora,One of the nicest things,Lyndork W,14-Sep-13,5,Pandora is one of the things in my life that never disappoints. I have had no problem with reception on my devices. With it's astounding variety of music the only limitations are on me for lack of creativity in my selections. In a lull at a recent party of mine someone talked about skating to a song and before you knew it we created a play list of the song and everyone was rocking and telling stories for the rest of the night.
Pandora,Four Stars,Steven King,16-Oct-17,4,I like pandora because I can choose songs I like and cancel songs I don't like
Pandora,MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)  ;)  :)  ;)  :)  ;),J.R,12-Jun-12,5,"People who give this app 1's are stupid because it's so awesome. I don't. get why people give this one star it's awesome cause when I put a band name it gives me the songs thar I want. Plus, when you want to just change it you don't have to get rid of the other radio, you could still keep it. The only thing that ticks me off is that commercials come up every 6 songs , but I'm still giving this app a 5 star rating. Don't ever listen to the people saying that it freezes or anything like that. So, get the app seriously, GET THE APP!!!!!!"
Pandora,not working,BeccaaMarie,22-Jan-16,1,Sometimes it will only play a few songs then stops then wont play none and sometimes it won't play at all ...I love Pandora its my favorite but idk why its not working on here .

Pandora,Padora on BlackBerry Passport - great sound,DOYLE S.,20-Jan-17,5,Works very well. Nice in a private setting with friends with no interrupted moments. Best when in the car and there is a really limited choice of music stations.
Pandora,pandora used to be awesome!!!,A. Konrade,30-Nov-12,2,I listen to Pandora constantly while on my kindle fire. up until a few weeks ago I would have definitely given this app 5 stars. but lately it gets stuck every few songs almost every time an ad comes up. I have to keep exiting and opening it up again just to hear a few more songs before it gets stuck again. I even uninstalled and reinstalled but that did not do any good. Pandora still seems to be running great on my Pc though. weird. please fix this problem because it is very annoying!
Pandora,Stubborn,JL,13-Dec-16,1,"does not respond to request, plays sometimes, repeats back something else then requested. acts like a stubborn child use to work ok now I don't know."
Pandora,Two Stars,Amazon Customer,5-Jan-15,2,This does not work very well at least for me with z2 xperia tablet
Pandora,Makes a noisy workplace less distracting,Amazon Customer,8-Apr-13,5,I work in a cubicle where I get a lot of distracting noise from a nearby conference room and other cubicles near me. Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi.
Pandora,Great music APP.,Texdriven,16-Nov-13,5,Excellent source for a variety of music. I enjoy playing Pandora music from different artists. I use it to play in my car radio and at home on a bluetooth speaker.

Pandora,Love it.,Marcia Pippin,6-Jan-13,5,"This is a wonderful free product. Selection--wow!! I haven't had trouble with commercials or dropping things they way some were complaining about. The product is great. Set stations as you want, delete as you want, skip songs. No problems. I was skeptical about this product but a friend of mine also got it on her tablet and she loved it so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. Love it!!! No problems and if you don't like it you can delete it, it isn't hard. No complaints!! Thanks."
Pandora,I think Pandora is not that fun to listen to,esther melo,9-Oct-17,3,"I think Pandora is not that fun to listen to, but me, yes I like Pandora , Pandora makes me play my Drums."
Pandora,"Does what it is supposed to, with one pretty big bug",Jubbles,8-Oct-13,3,"It plays music as it should. Very easy to add stations and all the things you can do with iton the PC. But on the kindle, I need to go to the settings and log off before I shutdown, otherwisewhen it starts back up, it freezes on the opening blue screen and I need to remove it from the deviceand re-download from the cloud to get it to work again - after reinstalling you get the login screenlike you would if you had logged off.So, its ok, its just that you can't remain logged in, and that's a bit inconvenient."
Pandora,Awesome!,Violet,11-Feb-13,5,Love this app. I put my earbuds in my kindle and fall asleep listening to my fave songs from today and fromt he 1980's!! Great app!!!!!
Pandora,I love Pandora!!!,anonymous,15-Apr-15,5,"It is so great when I can turn on Pandora and go to a station that plays only songs that I want to here, this app has a station for everyone even people who like to listen to instrumental where it's just like a brass symphony or brass set.

Pandora,Five Stars,Nick Lanning,19-Jun-17,5,Love the App. Hearing music I like and being able to fine tune the list is perfect.
Pandora,I want my money back!,K.Price,20-Mar-13,1,"I loved Pandora. I use to listen to it when I went to bed. Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I took the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I looked Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?"
Pandora,Love Pandora Rocks,Amazon Customer,27-Mar-16,5,Love  Pandora  Rocks!
Pandora,"okay, but...",Kindle Customer,14-Jul-14,3,"Sure it plays some music you actually want to listen to, but everything else you don't want it to play comes in abundance! so please make it more careful! so many  artists I haven't even heard of pop up! I want it to stop!(please!)"
Pandora,Its great for Music Lovers,Maggie,4-Jun-13,5,"Its a really great app for music. You can listen to different types of music (pop, country, ect.) And if you don't like a song you're listening to: don't worry. You can tap a ""next"" button which takes you to a different song. But beware! There's only 6 times in an hour you can do this. Its free, and you get to listen to a bunch of music. If you want to go free on music, just get the app and you get to listen to free music. Enjoy!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Cody Wilcher,3-Jan-17,5,A great radio i listen to it most of the day while working

Pandora,Great but has some sensoring and advertisement problems,Blake,10-Mar-12,3,"okay this app is totally pimped out but I mean come on! This app does not play sensored music, so its not great for kids under 13. But the app itself is amazing and you can create your own station and listen to that genre. But there is also another problem, the advertisements are outta control! Who wants to listen to dating ads every other song???? It told me that I can upgrade to Pandora1 for 3.99 a month and I cant afford that. so just listen to this review!!!!!!!! FROBRO OUT!!!!!!!"

Pandora,Great Tribute of A wonderful variety of Music,Nevada,4-Mar-14,5,It took awhile to figure out the ins and outs of operating this app but I do love it now and it was not hard to figure it all out. These Entertainers can really cut a rug on videos and albums but some of them need more experience to entertain live shows. Don't get me wrong but they need better instruments also and lots of ORIGINAL RIFFS to grab that Brass Ring.I wish all of our musicians  the very best...
Pandora,Like it,William,5-Apr-13,5,"I have always loved pandora. I have it on my computer,roku player,and blueray player.  It is easy to use and has great muisic."

Pandora,Pandora Subscription,EJR,14-Apr-13,5,Pandora is great! I tried the free app for just one day and decided that the yearly subscription is a great investment. I have been introduced to music that I did not know was out there. My library of hundreds of music compact disks do not get played much these days. I like how I can customize Pandora and experience a wide selection of artists. I highly recommend the paid subscription version of Pandora!

Pandora,Pretty necessary for your Fire,BVJim,20-Jan-17,5,I'm a music junkie so this was a no brainer for an app to add to my Fire tablet. It gives me the variety between the Prime music and Pandora stations. I bluetooth the audio to a Motorola Sol speaker.
Pandora,but otherwise very pleased with the app,Joseph Connelly,13-Dec-16,5,"Sadly, my kindle doesn't have the same adblock features my laptop does, so I get the pandora ads, but otherwise very pleased with the app."

Pandora,too much to get in,honeybird,1-Mar-16,4,What's with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it's like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that's too hard to do while I'm driving. HATE IT!!
Pandora,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,25-Oct-17,4,I love Pandora. It is truly a great music product that I find to be superior to any competitors.
Pandora,Its popular and for good reason!,Potato King,5-May-16,5,"This app is easy to use and the only slight downside is that ypu have to pay for no ads and such but it's still very cheap, (7$ I believe, don't quote me) and is worth it.5/5"

Pandora,Excellent performance on the Kindle Fire,littlenomad,1-Jan-12,5,"I use the Pandora app daily and have been able to find whatever music genre I need to fit my mood or act as appropriate background music while reading.  Sound quality is excellent on the Fire, and the app has been almost glitch-free.  One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you're listening to (if you like what you're hearing and want to buy it).  Pandora provides amazing entertainment value on the Kindle Fire, and in my opinion has something to offer any user."
Pandora,Viola!,Amazon Customer,5-Mar-14,4,"Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served.Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions (band name/song) that you give it. It's awesome, and super customizable. Best thing is it's a radio station. It's a different constant mix up.also, stick your phone/ tablet in a ceramic or metal bowl.""speakers"""

Pandora,It doesn't work anymore!!,jojobean0123,7-Aug-15,1,"I used to LOVE Pandora I used it all the time, but then my kindle had an issue and I had to restore it to factory settings. I got all my apps back, including Pandora, the app must have ""upgraded""(even though the setup, to me, looked like a five year old decided to move things around)I couldn't find anything at first(still don't know how to bookmark songs)but I got used to it. And then my Pandora started acting up, at first not very often it would just sit there after a song was done playing and it would just load, I would just go out of it and come back and it was fine, then that started becoming more frequent, and just now, I tried to go onto Pandora and every station I tried, Pandora just kept skipping all the songs, none of them would play they just kept coming on and then just skipped it, even the ads would be skipped. I tried deleting the app and put it back on, it would do the same thing. I deleted it and reinstalled it again 3 times, I tried everything, nothing would make it stop it just kept skipping all the songs. I am done with it, this is ridiculous, if it isn't fixed ASAP I'm just done with Pandora and I'm finding a new radio app."
Pandora,come on,Kindle Customer,16-Jun-15,4,"I love it, and would give it 5 stars, but it has lags!!!!!! This one time, I couldn't log in for a day because of the lag!

Pandora,Unsubscribed to Pandora One,R.Barbetta,5-Sep-12,2,"Update:  I canceled my Pandora subscription after they raised the price.  Just not worth it to me anymore... Too expensive to get rid of the ads... I'd rather just listen to the free version and deal with the ads.Former:  I listen to Pandora every day.  In the car, at the office, at the gym... There is simply no other way to get this much music for so little money.  I force close every once in a while when I undock from the car or change power sources.  Otherwise it's perfect."

Wish they would do away with that add!
Pandora,Great App,Amazon Customer,31-Jul-13,4,"I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you don't like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.It's great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app."

So if a song you don't like comes on, you can skip it! Also, if you type in a band or something like Maroon 5, it'll play songs similiar to Maroon 5 along with Maroon 5 itself. :) Get it! Also, the ads are usually every 3-5 songs. They are only 10-15 seconds long typically. They have ads so they can pay for the songs they play! Please get this app!"

Pandora,Won't Play Music!,Amber P,13-Feb-16,1,"The app will not play music! It will play a single song, and then will stop playing. It wil show the next song, but won't let me hit play, skip, etc. I love Pandora, but will have to listen to music elsewhere if the app doesn't even work!"
Pandora,Can't live without it!,dls74447,25-Apr-15,5,Absolutely love it!
Pandora,"The music is great, the commercials are a pain",Norman R,10-Dec-12,3,"I guess that's the point of free versus subscription service, but the commercials have become more frequent and more intrusive. Before they used to be just quick announcer-based commercials, now they are full blown professionally produced commercials just like you would hear on commercial radio. They are very irritating, to say the least."
Pandora,Music to my ears,msjs,23-Jan-14,5,I love listening to music without having to put in the CD or looking for the CD especially when I am trying to relax.

Pandora,Music....,Coach JR,15-Jul-13,5,"I have a couple of music downloads, and I perfer Pandora.  Free version still won't let you forward past songs as much as you'd like..."
Pandora,Almost Perfect,Emily,20-Jul-12,4,"The Pandora app is really very functional and I rarely encounter problems with it... but when I do, it's extremely frustrating. The song will stop midway, only to move on to a 3 minute ad. Now my main problem with this app is that if you pause a song for more than a certain amount if time and you're on the Internet browser, the song will close and you have to go back to the homepage to restore. Other than that, it's a great app, I just wish these minor details would be fixed."
Pandora,la la la!!!,Amazon Customer,14-Jul-14,5,"I'm always listening to music at hhome so this is perfect because I don't have to buy any songs. or listen to the same songs over and over. So this is great because it has a huge variety of music!!! I recommend the:- ""Today's hits radio""- "" Dubstep radio""- "" Jasmine Thompson radio"""
Pandora,LOVING PANDORA!,DoD,21-Feb-15,5,If you love music you should get PANDORA it is the bomb. I always listen to Pandora all the time in fact I am listening to it right now.it is very convenient.you can even pick your own music.there is even music for studying.HOW AWESOME. THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING PANDORA IF YOU DO THANKS......!!!!!!!#@SH
Pandora,I like this app,Deloris Payne,20-Mar-15,4,I like this app. I listen to it everyday at work. I like making radio stations and the music that is played is based on likes so the next time you get music you like. I don't mind the commercials don't feel to need to pay for the no commercial version.
Pandora,Didn't get what I was expecting,Wiley Traylor,19-Jan-14,3,"The product information indicated it was a 10-pack; 20 batteries, but I only received a 5-pack (10 batteries).  It's too much trouble to complain so I just learned a lesson and will not order this item again."
Pandora,Five Stars,Dennis P. Griffith,3-May-17,5,Love it. Pandora can really adds something to my routine.
Pandora,"Music, Music",Katherine M.,20-Sep-13,5,"Pandora is a lot of fun. I love the fact that you can personalize the music you listen to by adding in an artist of your choice. However, I do have one complaint. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes you get music that shouldn't even be categorized next to a genre. If I type in ""Disturbed,"" I don't want ""Britney Spears."" Period."
Pandora,love pandora but app could use improvements,Natalie,31-May-12,3,"there are no technical issues with this app and I use it all the time on my Fire.  however, I don't like getting audio ads.  I don't get them when I listen his the web do why via an app?  also I am now getting tmobile ads in Spanish.  I don't listen to music in Spanish.  this is really really annoying.  additionally, I cant tweak my channels on the app like I can via the web.  please add this as a feature.  oh, please let me see songs I previously listened to like I can on the web."
Pandora,Five Stars,Don B,18-Jul-17,5,Luv it

Pandora,Pandoria!!!,Pordolph 14,20-Dec-13,5,"I Love This App!I'm Listining To It As I Write This Review:)It Gives You Free Music:)It Does Not Give You What You Want To Listin To Whenyou make a station...It gives you a song that's like it...I kinda like that though, gives you more choices to makewith your amazon card or itunes card.overall.... great app!!!"
Pandora,Great for the car,Deliuta,5-Dec-11,5,"I downloaded this app 6 months ago on my Droid X and recently on my Droid X 2. Both times, I've enjoyed plugging in my phone with an audio jack into my car and surfing my stations. It sucks up battery pretty fast, so I also charge my phone in the car while listening to Pandora. And it only works if you have wifi or 3G available which isn't an issue unless you're driving far out in the countryside.I recommend this app and want to mention that I haven't had songs skip or not fully play.If I will, I'll update this review."
Pandora,great music but has flaws,Kindle Customer,2-Jan-14,4,"Pandora has great quality, but when you make a station it will play a lot of different artists. Not even 50 percent of the music is the artist the station is supposed to play. You can skip songs, but you only get a certain number of skips. It also has adds. You have to pay $4.00 monthly to get no adds and other things that may annoy you. Overall it's a very nice app."
Pandora,great app,DDennis,17-Aug-15,5,"I am 12. And I think that this app is the best app I have on my kindle. I believe there is literally only one flaw: Not everybody has it!!! Once again, I totally love this app. Five stars from me. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"

Pandora,Great Music Service,Mr. T Story,10-Sep-13,5,Pandora has successfully made an app that oust all the other music/radio to shame. Only the quick advertisements take away from what is fluid and complety personal listening experience. On top of that Pandora continues to before better and better updates keeping the music fresh and the features applicable to what you look for on the app. Overall Pandora dwarfs all other radio apps.
Pandora,My dear Pandora,Renee Yoder,2-Apr-12,5,"It took me a while to really love Pandora.  I don't know why.  Having some control over what music you want to hear just sounded too good to be true.  It really is as simple as that.  Well, Pandora, I think I love you.I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  I love just about everything.  One thing I wish that app could do is show the list of the songs I have 'thumbs upped'.  As far as I know, this app cannot do that.  Also, hate the ads...but I deal with them for free awesome radio."
Pandora,Five Stars,forrestina,30-Jul-17,5,Its the best music app.
Pandora,Not worth ad free cost for very limited repertoire in CHORALE. Lynn Music superior.,Amazon Customer,24-Aug-16,1,"Very limited repertoire in each category of music, especially CHORALE. SNEAKY increase in price from $3.99 to $4.99 per month for ad free listening."

Pandora,"awesome, especially 4 older ppl -  grandchildren help too",L. Wishart,27-Sep-13,5,"Amazing, how music listening has evolved from reel to reel-4 and 8 track-cassette-cd; now i dont need drawers of storage space to find music I feel like listening too at the moment. Just pick a genre, (learn how to set up files or channels ? Will probably help too) get to hear music that I like, but never would have known it without Pandora choosing to play it based on my chosen genres."
Pandora,Teenaged exploration!,J.A. Strockbine,22-Jul-13,5,"My 16 year old daughter just loves Pandora - and has enjoyed discovering and setting up several eclectic types of ""stations""."
Pandora,The best!,Ripper666,2-Feb-16,5,"I dropped Sirius because their music is 70 years old! They are so out of touch their ""Chill"" station is all vocals!  If I create an instrumental station on Pandora, I won't hear a lyric for hours."
Pandora,I'm in love  BUT,Ralph Corbin,2-Aug-12,4,"Ok i'm 51 and never knew what Pandora was until my son who has an iphone showed it to me.  Then found out I could get the app for free on my Kindle Fire.  I love it.  I think it is so neat how you make a album, type in a song or artist and it starts playing that song, then plays others song sort of like that one or even by same artist.  And you click on thumbs up if you like it or thumbs down if you never want to hear that song again.  It remembers.  The only thing I wish was different is I wish that you could make a folder called MY FAVORITES and then drag all your songs that you absolutely love and want to hear over and over and over again into that folder.  The way it is not you get to hear those you love, but others too and might not like everything playing.  Sometimes I don't want to check out new songs in same catagory such as country, rap, techno etc.  I just want to hear ONLY the ones I know the words to or that remind me of things."
Pandora,Five Stars,J.L.V.,30-Oct-17,5,Great variety of music! Also a great price; $4.99/mo. with no commercials - gotta love that!
Pandora,Works but keeps dropping songs at end,Editor,20-Oct-13,3,Downloaded this for my Android tablet and works fine except keeps dropping the song and moving to the next before the end of the song.  I have deleted and reinstalled but still happens.  Pandora is not my favorite as we have same issues in the car on my Android phone (4g Verizon) and on our TV.  I still prefer iHeart which does not drop but I can't get on my old Tablet.
Pandora,The only problem is that the network losses station and ...,Amazon Customer,17-Oct-17,5,The only problem is that the network losses station and signal a lot in the north east part of Philadelphia
Pandora,cool app,Leigh McDonough,28-May-14,5,"I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"

Pandora,Ads suck and the interface is difficult with them running.,Ben Carter,16-Nov-11,2,"What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site."
Pandora,Too many ads. If u want to upgrade you ...,Amazon Customer,25-May-16,3,Too many ads. If u want to upgrade you have answer too many questions. Yes should mean yes I want to upgrade.
Pandora,Love it for the most part - BUT having trouble viewing movies due to network problems.,Ivy,15-Nov-13,3,We like it because we don't have cable... the free shipping is great.  But have had some trouble with the network in watching the movies.
Pandora,Variation of musical styles a real plus,Herbert C Parker,6-Sep-17,5,Select performers that reflect the mood you're in and enjoy. An occasional click to say like or dislikewill have various types of music well managed.
Pandora,App,Amazon Customer,28-Mar-16,1,I guess I'll be canceling. App won't open.
Pandora,It's ok!,AnnaS,25-Dec-12,3,I wish Pandora would allow me to pick the specific music I want to hear.  I guess it wasn't designed to do that.  So it's just a three star review from me.
Pandora,Five Stars,dwallace14,8-Jun-15,5,Good music app.
Pandora,Awesome,Marcia,1-Nov-17,5,Love it...people often ask me what music station I'm using... great choice
Pandora,Five Stars,Tina Rooker,23-May-17,5,"Love it, wish I could get complete albums on it"
Pandora,Its ok.,Amazon Customer,10-Mar-16,3,Not bad.  Unfortunately the algorithm doesn't differentiate between stations.  Eventually you will hear what you like from your Willie Nelson station on your Nine Inch Nails station.
Pandora,Fantastic-I love it,joewalk181,18-Feb-13,5,I always listen to Pandora now when I can get it through a hotspot at the gym. If I can't get it then I will listen to my songs that I have downloaded.
Pandora,Five Stars,maria rodriguez,21-Aug-17,5,I enjoy listening to all the old classic music without having to download it
Pandora,Fix plz,A.mercado,29-Nov-12,3,ive used this app for around a year now but lately ive been using my kindle fire. and i noticed that when a commercial came on it would stop all the music and the loading icon came on.but it never played it so i would have to change to a different station. and then go back to it. it cant be my internet because its always full bars. so i dont know whats going on. so ya. it would be apprecieated if you could maybe see if you could fix this
Pandora,Love this service!,Hildy,29-Jan-13,5,"Wherever you use Pandora, you gotta use it!  I don't pay for the service, so I have to suffer through the ads.  But, what it has done is suggest several different musicians to me that I would never have thought of.  I then promptly go to Amazon and buy the CD (after listening to a few track samples of course).  It is a great way to find out what's out there!"
Pandora,Ok...,saigahunter,9-Feb-15,3,"It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."

Pandora,Wow! FREE MUSIC!!!!!!,L.Koleszar,28-Jan-13,5,"wowza this app is amazing!!! it is like having free music! similar to iheart radio, but you get to skip the songs six times an hour per station (unlike iheart radio, where you only can skip a few times for the whole app a day or something like that) . it is like having free music! plus, you get your own profile where you can even look up song lyrics and artist profiles! love this app! you must get if you want FREE MUSIC!!!!"
Pandora,Love it but...,gogo girl,12-Jul-12,4,"Don't get me wrong I love the fact that they play great music for no price at all. Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for $ 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I don't want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up!:)"
Pandora,Fallacy of the Music Genome Project,J. Crow,25-Sep-13,2,"The free version of Pandora plays music at 128K, which is only good for people who have very low standards in audio quality. Pandora One has 192K sound, but the quality is nowhere near iTunes Radio. The game is over for Pandora. Apple is choosing people who are pillars of music to choose their own playlists, and the lack of crappy songs that comes with Pandora is but a memory."
Pandora,Don't like new update!,kyle vandyne,11-Nov-17,2,I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!

Pandora,Pandora,read between the lines,30-Jan-14,4,"I love the new Pandora app. This keeps you from having to spend your money on separate pieces of music when you barely use them or you get tired of the song and wasted your money. If you like Pandora on your computer, you will love it on your Kindle. The only bad thing is that rarely it freezes, but when you restart or just exit and come back to it, all goes back to normal."

Pandora,"Ugh, no play history!",Kindle Customer,13-Jan-16,2,"No idea why this app is different from other Pandora apps, if you like a song or dislike it you have to rate it when it is playing you can't view played songs.  And the screen saver is ugly."
Pandora,Pandora is wonderful because you hear the music you love......................,John Heuston,27-Jan-13,5,"For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists.  Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song.Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it."

The site lets me select all the different types of music/artists together in one place for my listening pleasure without my having to do anything but rate the music as it is played.  I tell Pandora who I like and they find music for my listening pleasure.  Sometimes I use Pandora on my computer (with headphones) and sometimes I just listen over my HTC."
Pandora,Love this app on any device,Megan Williams,21-Dec-12,5,I love this app on any device. It is so nice to listen to all the music you want to and it still has way less ads than listening to a radio.

Pandora,Pandora met my expectations,Ron Crawford,5-Jun-14,4,"Although the learning curve is a little steep even I was able to get what I wanted.  The music comes in a variety of genres most  of which I haven't had time to explore.  You can save favorite tracks, search by artist, track or song.  I still need to spend more time learning how to use it. But I'm very pleased so far."
Pandora,Not keeping up with competition,sjdaddyo,3-May-15,3,"I like Amazon Prime radio better. Amazon allows you to repeat a song, advance to a later part of the song, shows the lyrics (Pandora dropped this feature from mobile), and has free downloads of some songs. Creating playlists also a big plus."

Pandora,worst app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,gothgirlblack&amp;blue,4-Oct-14,1,"Whenever I want to open my one direction radio, it says Pandora has stopped. It won't let me listen to meatloaf, acdc, led zeplen, or foreigner, Styx, journey, Boston, Don felder, the eagles, or any of my favorite bands. I'm a ten year old and I'm getting so frustrated with this app."
Pandora,5 stars!,Jordan Ashley,27-Jun-14,5,"I think the app is great. My only complaint about Pandora is that you can't pick specific song's or artists that you want to hear, they just match you up to song's similar to the song and artist of your choosing, which can be frustrating but it's better than the radio for background music and I knew what I was getting so I still gave a 5 star rating."
Pandora,"Pretty Good, One Problem.",Jane M. Stewart,26-Feb-13,4,"This is a great app, and I love Pandora. It introduces me to new songs similar to the ones I like when I search for my favorite bands. However, one problem recently came up. When I open Pandora, and my Kindle Fire locks, it won't unlock. I've tried holding down the power button, but nothing works. As far as I've found, it only happens with this app. If this problem is fixed, it would be a perfect app."
Pandora,I love Pandora they have a great selection of music,Mystique McQueede,25-Aug-16,5,I love Pandora they have a great selection of music. My daughter plays it all the time so I got it. better than the radio at times.
Pandora,Not Available in Panama,Omar Upegui R.,8-Dec-11,2,"I thought Pandora would run in Panama, since Amazon made a big noise about releasing a colossal amount of content for the Kindle Fire.  The first app, I tried to download and install was Pandora Radio.  To my disappointment, Pandora is only available for the U.S. market.As you can imagine, I'm not a happy person, and there is not a smile on my face.  Please Amazon, open up your Apps to the international market.Omar Upegui R.Panama, Republic of PanamaCentral America"
Pandora,Pandora fan for years now,Kris,13-Jan-12,4,"I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it's great.Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they've gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."
Pandora,awsome,Van,23-Mar-14,5,I love Pandora my teacher played Pandora on Friday we danced because we did every thing we had to do than my mom bought me a Kindle fire HD for my birthday so I downloaded Pandora it works perfectly and you can listen to new music from the station you know. I used to didn't like Taylor swift but now I LOVE her music Great app download it and you'll see.
Pandora,Awesome,Christopher C. Holt,20-Feb-17,5,So this app is amazing but I wish you could listen to a song more than once but it is still great
Pandora,Eyeintheskky,Love the game!  I have one request to make it more interesting and that is:  To make it work playing words both forward or backwords.  Thanks!,22-Mar-15,5,"Love the the vatriety of music.  The genre classification is great as we we can give a thums down as just receive what we want to listen to, as Pandora removes songs you don't like.  Great way to match music to individual tastes.  Kudos Pandora!"
Pandora,Music is forever,Candita Ramos-Montes,24-Dec-12,5,All kinds of music whether it's for you or your kids.  If you're in the mood for romance or in the mood for up beat music Pandora is for you.
Pandora,pandora problems,madison,3-Dec-12,2,I use to love pandora it was a great way to listen to music and get a great variety of the artists i love but lately on my kindle and phone with the upgrade ill be playing a song the song will end and the app will  not be running so i have to unlock my device and go to the app and wait an additional 30 sec. to listen to music its aggravating and is a waste of time fix the problem or your going to loose a customer
Pandora,Efficient control over what you listen to,Elmer W Martin,13-Jul-13,5,"What sets Pandora apart is the ability to insert other groups or styles of music into a pre-set channel.  You can essentially create your own preferred variety in the music, mixing and matching groups as you see fit to keep your ears happy.  Lots of programs can play one group over and over.  Few mix solely at the discretion of the user and do it as seamlessly as Pandora."

Pandora,couldn't do housework without it,Breana Nicole Smith,13-Jan-13,5,I use this app more than any app combined. I use the top comedian station and immediately I forget about whatever I am doing and am entertained the whole day. A+ app
Pandora,My house has been redone by Pandora,Sarah J. Ritter,20-Jun-13,5,"Every time I paint a room, I've done it with Pandora blasting.  With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home.  The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends.  We are home."

Pandora,Hit or miss,james,26-Mar-15,2,Work well until you use it too much. I leave it on all day play list repeats frequently. Then I receive notices about overuse and the fact that they have to pay for each song. Don't offer unlimited play if you're going to complain about it!
Pandora,eh...,Rachele,22-Oct-16,4,"I wanted an an app for soundcloud, but it wasn't available. This app has done well for being a second best."

Pandora,Love Pandora,Alstew2000,14-Jan-12,5,how could you not love all this music for free. somehow though my channels always seem to lean heavily toward the Beatles but still awesome app.
Pandora,Music to my ears....,jonsey123,30-Mar-13,4,"I love Pandora...I didn't give it five stars, because of those silly ads.. I know they have bills too, but they get soooo annoying!"

Pandora,Music+Games=I get to listen to music while playing games!,Dog the robot,20-Jul-14,5,"WolfyNat here, love this app sooooo much because I can listen to music while I play games and mostly do anything else.... BUT here's a tip if you didn't know, it also doesn't just play music from the exact artist you searched up but I still love it, it's better that way and another tip there are ad's but I don't CARE =D..... SO get this app..... ITS FREE!"
Pandora,My 3rd most used App.,CPAChicago,23-Oct-11,5,"I have never had an issue with this program on my HTC Thunderbolt (tho I do pay for the service and I also have unlimited data) and I use it all the time.  I pay the monthy fee and have several channels set up.  One can quickly get tired of managing and not getting weary of a personal list of mp3 files.  Pandora frees me from having to deal with that.If you are using Green Power, you have to remember to pause Green Power or you will just get one song every 10 minutes."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,4-Aug-17,5,I love it I can play all kinds of music thank you keep the good work up.
Pandora,Best App Ever.,lalala,12-Feb-14,5,Pandora is a useful app for listening to various types of music. The Genome project has been succesful in creating an app that generates a radio station specific to your taste.  Unlike other radio apps that play just the populatlr songs i like pandora because it plays all the songs on an album not just the mainstream ones.
Pandora,Four Stars,Kindle Customer,29-Jan-15,4,works as specified ...
Pandora,Five Stars,James Mack,26-Jun-17,5,Always good music
Pandora,song options and lists,I LUV GOD!!!!!!,2-Jan-14,4,"I love how you can listen to free music but you cannot go back toThe songs that you just listened to. Also I don't like that when you type in a playlist or artist there are other artists like for example if you type in Katy Perry you would get a mix of Taylor swift, Lorde, and other artists. But besides all of that it is a pretty good app!!!"
Pandora,tablet/kindle problems,Donna,26-Jul-15,2,"I love pandora but I've recently been having trouble getting into it on both my tablet and kindle. I end up having to uninstall and reinstalling the app in order for it to work. no problems on my desktop,  tho."

Pandora,Four out of Five,Amazon Customer,28-Dec-16,4,I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I sometimes don't like the covers songs that get into my station. Other than that pandora is amazing!
Pandora,"Annoying, Incessant Ads and Continual Upgrade Harassment",Curious,30-Oct-13,2,"Free is a relative term. What price is ""free""dom? In the case of Pandora's app the price is getting an annoying pop-up ad box in the center of the display virtually every 2 seconds. The curse, if you don't upgrade you will be haunted by never ending ads until time immemorial. Given that ad curse, you might think that they'd only deliver the Blues. But, to be fair, there are considerably more music genres to choose from. Hence the 2nd star. We each have different patience levels. You have to decide what you are willing to put up with ad-wise for the free app. Just know what you're getting into."
Pandora,YOUR kind of music application! The ONLY choice for my diversity of choice.,Sarah Nash,21-Jun-14,5,"Really enjoy being able to find whatever kind of music I am in the mood for. And free! Being on Social Security Disability does not allow for a lot of extras. With Pandora, I can find whatever I want and listen to it for free. Don't mind the commercials, they have to pay for their station of incredible choices somehow!"
Pandora,LOVE IT SOOO MUCH!!!! :),PJ Martin,31-Dec-15,5,The reason why I love this app is because you can listen to any station you want so litsen up............  GET THIS APP  NOW!!
Pandora,Great app!,roger s.,26-Nov-12,4,"This app is awesome! You get to listen to music for free! The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't get to pick your songs... you get to pick the station you made but not the song. You make your station by typing in a band, song or singer. Then songs will play and if you like them you push the thumbs up and if you don't push the thumbs down. This app is the best! You won't regret it at all."

Pandora,charlie,jj,6-Nov-12,5,this is a good app because if you want to listen to music on the radio than here you go. if you know a song but cant remember the name of it it tells you and you can write it down like I do.when I couldn't remember a song I ask my cousin and she told me the name of the band but not the song. so now I get the band and the song.well I hope you lin it and remember if I reviewed it it means it good.bye y'all.

Pandora,Works Great,BobRossIsBoss,20-Jul-12,5,"I have the Kindle Fire, and this is one of the first apps I downloaded. After using it for several months, I decided I would leave a review because I base most of my purchases on others' reviews as well.I use Pandora on my PC, and the Pandora app hasn't let me down on my Kindle. It's free, feels like the website, and runs in the background while I read a book or surf the web. I would say this is a must-have app!"
Pandora,pandora kindle fire hd,yas,15-Nov-12,3,when i upgradws from a kindle fire to a kf hd i swapped all my apps over expecting them to all work the same. im an avid pandora user however ive encountered only one problem thats extremely annoying. when im ready to close pandora the little menu button doesnt work. so i have to just pause it and forget about it. i love pandora but its super annoying that i cant close the app whenever im done with it.

Pandora,Great product when it starts on first time....,M. Jennings,28-Oct-11,2,"I have a Nexus S (Sprint) and it usually takes 4-5 times for Pandora to finally open and let me play a song.  Usually it gets stuck at a screen with Pandora title on a blue background screen, but nothing else.  I have to exit out, and try cycling thru the startup process several times before it lets me get to the point where I can play music. I don't use Pandora on my phone much because of this bug, and it drives me crazy because I love Pandora on my computer."

Pandora,"Pretty good, could be better. I'll keep using it.",laila,18-Jul-15,3,The ads and not letting you skip more than a couple songs are really irritating. Especially when you cant add a specific song. I will listen to it because it is free. Will not pay for the supposed add free version. That is why you purchase the music and put in a CD.
Pandora,the skips,s.mccall,7-Apr-12,3,"when I first installed Pandora, it was amazing but then when it automatically upgraded, the things I liked about it changed. before the upgrade, if I were to skip six times I could quit Pandora then start it again and would be able to skip all over again.now after the upgrade if I skip six times and quit,I cannot skip again.what is the point in listening to the music you want to hear if you cant skip the music you DONT want to hear."

I am sad that pandora and I have such an on again off again relationship. :(
Pandora,THIS SUCKS!!!!!,Janelle Ramirez,28-Dec-14,2,I'm sorry but I recommend iheart radio. It is so much better. Pandora always freezes when I want to hear a song advertisements pop up and end clicking that instead of a thumps up or down. Iheart radio is simple and easy. But then again it's not my choice

Pandora,Use it a lot,Amazon Customer,11-Apr-14,4,"I love Pandora, and use it everywhere. I can select the artists, music, comedy, etc. And choose not to listen to a track again, or more often. I wish I could forward more often, though. The list doesn't have the abc column on the right anymore, so I have to scroll through the whole list to get to Z, rather than hit Z. Why they changed it, is a mystery."

Pandora,awesome music app!,the best game ever,9-Sep-14,5,this app is awesome because you can get as many stations as you want and you can get followers and follow Ppl to see what are there fav music. if you don't want that you can have a private account and just use it for music.

I had tried to download this app from the Pandora website several weeks ago, but was completely unable to.

There is an occassional advertisement, and when it does come it only last 30 seconds at the most. Its free to listen to so yes of course your gonna need advertisements to pay the bills for Pandora. Great songs, and so many stations avalible. I would definitely recommend this app if you would like to listen to add types of music for free!"

Pandora,Awful. Very disappointed ! I Uninstalled it !  Too many refusals for its ability to accept !,Amazon Customer,12-Aug-17,1,I found Pandora to be of no value. If i had paid for it i would feel cheated.The promise of liustening only to music i like is a lie.The stuff they offered when i asked for Mozart was stuff I would never even classify as the same genre. I can't even imagine what genre that stuff was part of. Very disappointed!I've uninstalled it. I might try spotify (?) or some other music app.Very disappointed!If i could i would give it a rating of minus stars ! ! !VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! !

Pandora,confused...,CollinMDP,29-Jan-13,2,"It's doing a lot better with the skipping problem. Maybe I was listening too much? I don't know. But now I turn Pandora on, and the option to zoom out to view bios, lyrics, and how the song relates to your selection is gone. What the heck? That means that I also can't go back and view songs that I liked but didn't catch the name of I. time. Not cool.~Kindle Fire?"

Pandora,Pandora's ups and downs,Mrs.Sherlock,28-May-13,4,"Pandora allows you to listen to a variety of music (you name it!!!). It is great to listen to whole working or being occupied. It does not always play the songs you want even if you 'like' them. It only allows you six skips per hour and gives you a certain # of hours to listen for a month. Every month is renewed. If you use all of your ""Pandora minutes"", you have to pay extra to listen for the rest of the month. But it is a terrific and extremely useful app!)"

Pandora,Pandora,srfwidow,17-Jun-13,5,"Pandora is the greatest invention since FM radio.  Rather than choosing a station based on what kind of music you like you now choose an artist you're in the mood to listen to and it never fails to satisfy. I love 80's hair bands for working out, jack Johnson for cooking, Chris daughtry for working and Abba by the pool."
Pandora,Pandora the best but...,Degon,17-Jan-13,4,works very well except when you want to skips more than 6 song even if your subscribe to pandora one...they said you gonna be able to skip more  but not...and i cant share my song with account of facebook . or twitter...have a error when you try to share...
Pandora,Awesome,rzxn30,19-Jun-15,5,This app enables me to listen to whatever I want to it rocks whoever doesn't like it is totally missing out on the fun it brings you on Friday night party's and random gigs!!
Pandora,why are there so many complaints?,jdog,12-Dec-12,5,"I love Pandora (and not just cuz I'm 11(I didn't change the User name) it gives a great verity and when I like songs,  it remembers and plays them again it learns what you like. plus,  I don't even see slacker radio on the ""top free"" section. so tut should prove that Pandora is better than slacker.(even though ive never listened to slacker)"
Pandora,Pandora app,n weber,20-Jul-12,5,"Pandora is an incredible app to purchase! You can listen to any type of music you'd like!

Pandora,SO WORTH IT,Amazon Customer,15-Apr-12,4,"this app is amazing! especially considering that it's free! I never have to buy music, I just make different channels, that I can adjust to my liking, and have playlists of songs that fit every mood. The occasional commercial, around one every 15 songs doesn't bother me, WHO CARES IT WAS FREE!!!!! ive never had problems with loading on my kindle fire or laptop. GET THIS APP!!! 5 stars."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,29-Mar-16,5,"It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"
Pandora,Fix your app!,Kelli,4-Jan-13,2,"The app doesn't play the whole song through, and it will just outright not play one after a failed advert didn't even play.  You have to skip it.  Please fix this app Pandora.  I love the content but this app is awful.  And even seeing as there have been quite a few complaints about the same problems,  you don't seem to be in a hurry to fix it."
Pandora,Let the music flow!,Amazon Customer,9-Nov-11,5,"Perhaps one of the best music services available.  Pandora is a streaming music service that allows you to search for the music you like based off a particular song, artist, genre, etc. Pandora works by using the 3/4g connection of your phone or tablet.  If that is not available it also can use wifi! This program takes the internet version and brings it into one small package perfect for the android market!"
Pandora,Great compromise for streaming music,G. Jones,8-Jan-16,5,"Pandora is a great compromise for streaming music.  Although the free version has commercials, they are not that offensive or as frequent as the other streaming music of broadcast stations."

Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora  Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great!

Pandora,Good Pandora app,Farley X Wilbur,9-Nov-15,5,"Great app for pandora. I play it through a real set of speakers, so I get the full benefit."
Pandora,FAIL!,K. Wurster,18-May-12,1,"I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I'm lucky if I hear more than 30 seconds. I gave Pandora the benefit of the doubt and waited until the latest update... but still the same thing. I am uninstalling. Pandora has lost another customer."

Pandora,"I will miss you, Pandora",wind,21-Nov-12,1,"I am an old man. 61 years old to be exact. I have always loved music, and the only way I knew to play it was by putting on a record, or as time went by, a compact disc. Pandora, when I finally discovered it, was a revelation. I could create my own stations...and suddenly my home was filled with Bach, Thomas Newman, Argo Part or when we had guests, an easy listening station. But slowly the app died. It would play one song and refuse to play another. This happened more and more frequently and I finally gave up and downloaded Songa. It works fine. Goodbye Pandora.***5/23/13***I have returned to Pandora! They repaired the app. Sure, there are more commercials but that's ok. Try it, you can't beat the price. Few apps have given me greater enjoyment."

Pandora,Nice application,MainerMommy4,12-Mar-13,4,If it weren't for the commercials I would have given 5 stars. I like that there are so many different stations to choose from. And the options to skip a song if you don't want to listen to it is nice. Also the thumbs up and thumbs down option is great. Especially when you don't like a song so it won't choose it at random later.

You can play games, go online, or read while it plays in the background, or if you just want to listen to music it's a good way to discover artists.

XM is just too much money unless you travel alot.  Pandora fills the spot nicely.  Its good on travel too if you have good internet service in your area of travel.  I have not tried their premium service, but I am thinking about it."
Pandora,Pandora Forever,B.Sha,11-Feb-15,5,I LOVVVEE pandora with such a wide selection and so many genres why would I turn on the radio? But sometimes I do get stuck listening to the same songs but its easily fixed with a new station.

Pandora,LOVE THIS APP,j.koeth,16-Dec-12,5,Pandora is great. It can create numerous stations of music to your selection. Such as pop/rock/Christmas/country etc. You can also search by artist ot songs.If your not the greatest at finding songs you like Pandora can surely help. The only thing I don't like about this app is that it requires wi-fi. Other than that it's a five star app!

Pandora,Love it!,kstradling,23-Jul-14,5,It is a great way to listen to music.It lets you create stations and like or dislike any songs.The only problem is that when you dislike or try to skip a song at the wrong time you get a annoying pop up that you have to respond to.
Pandora,LOVE PANDORA,Lester E Jackson,18-Jan-13,5,"Great app, I play Pandora around the house and depending on my mode I set the station and let it go."
Pandora,Pandora-the best,Amazon Customer,16-Dec-11,5,"I have found Pandora the most veratile and dependable of all the music suppliers. I use it on my ethernet connected TV, my PC, my Android X2 and my Kindle. Artists available are most all that I have looked for. Plus you can buy a song or an album if you like. Their variety of artists used has introduced me to new groups that I otherwise might not have heard. A very well thought out program."
Pandora,Too many adds,Jill J. Livingston,13-Aug-12,4,There are way too many adds. Once in a while an add will come up saying Why adds and then explains. 10 times or more in a song you have too close out a mini add and if you miss the x it will take you to the company's website. So annoying!It has a nice variety of songs on each channel that goes along with the genre of music you are listening to.
Pandora,Rocking at the gym.,Barbara Valdez,19-May-16,1,I have enjoyed Pandora radio immensely. It has made my gym workouts much more fun and I can select the music to the mode or work out I have planed .

Pandora,Five Stars,Anne C Kerner,20-Apr-17,5,All the music I could want!
Pandora,Getting worse somehow,jamyn,8-Jun-12,3,"Won't play after being idle for a few minutes, I have to close the app and re-open it to get it started again. Multiple times I've had it randomly skip through all my channels when it's not on quick mix. I hate to complain about ads, but they seem to be getting longer and more often. At least make the ads different sometimes, it's always the same ads over and over."
Pandora,Great Music,Betty Ennis,15-Jul-16,5,"I love Pandora because no matter what kind of music you're into,you can get it on Pandora.I love old R&B and with Pandora I can plenty."
Pandora,would have gave 5 stars,Sarahblc,9-Feb-15,3,this app is great and all because it's free music. But when I try to skip the song; not only does it not skip; it pops up an ad and I have to go to another station and back again to skip.
Pandora,great /failing,sharon mills,9-Oct-12,4,I just got this app and I'm in love with maroon 5 the script neon trees and any other alternate band ...but sadly it just cut off and said ' sorry app has forclosed' or ' we are unable to play any more music under this station.  please change stations' if this doesn't Starr to work in the next day ..DELETE! its a waiste if thatsvall its gonna do
Pandora,Restart Fixed My Pandora,Kiko,27-Mar-16,5,This is one of my most used apps. I am a PandoraOne subscriber. The update disabled the app. It opened and played about a second. I reinstalled it but it didn't work until I restarted my Z30. Working great again!
Pandora,stop complaining,jdel97,21-Feb-12,4,"people are saying that Pandora is declining, but i haven't experienced any problems that everyone is complaining about. my only issue is the commercials and they only come on like once an hour. the songs never stop randomly and pandoda is still working fine fkr me. if you're having a problem with Pandora, either suck it up and deal with it or use something else like iHeartRadio."
Pandora,woukd reccomend this to my friends!,Albert Cantin,1-Aug-15,4,"It let's you pick your groups, and any song you do not like, can be changed (stopped) to something you should like ( only so many times though), that is the only part that needs to be changed!

Pandora,Best Personalized Radio EVER!!,Dominique,11-Feb-12,5,"Pandora is awesome! If I'm cleaning up around the house or hosting a slumber party for my little sister, Pandora always has the best stations to choose from. Today's Hits radiois hands-down my favorite.  Its better than 92.5 or 93.3 on the real radio stations. Choose Pandora now if you love music and you think that stopping every 3 minutes to put a new song on youtube is insane!"
Pandora,Four Stars,Lacie,13-Jun-16,4,Really enjoy the tunes and there are less commercial interruptions than before.
Pandora,Awesome!!!!!!!,Syd,15-Jun-12,5,"I love this app. very limited commercials. if you are planning to get I heart radio get this instead. one problem you may dislike though is the ads and you only can skip 6 times an hour. I like how you can skip like three times and it will play a different song. you also can go to a particular type of person. for example, you can go to the selena Gomez station."
Pandora,great music like it knows me!,Bryan F.,30-Jan-16,5,Great selections of the type of music I like! A few to adds but they need to get paid for a free site to use!
Pandora,Works great on Blackberry 10!,W. Mitchell,4-Sep-15,5,"Would rather listen on my nice home system, but the mobile version is a must have; should be one of the first apps one downloads to new phone."

Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,18-Jan-17,5,Super. I love all the songs in my chosen category. Hope you have one in the philippines!!!
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,12-Oct-17,5,Great variety of music
Pandora,Needs another upgrade!,Soccer#1,28-Oct-12,3,on the ipod if you bookmarks a track you can go to another feature on it and listen to all the songs you've bookmarked. on the kindle you bookmarks something and nothing really happens it just says track bookmarked or the songs name bookmarked. please make another update so we can listen to songs we bookmarks. wow I said bookmarks a lot:)
Pandora,awesome,sky,14-Dec-15,5,best app ever for music it puts out most bad words and can hÃ¡ve all most all stations u want so get it its good

Pandora,This Is The Place,CeeDeeWee,16-Nov-16,5,Love Good Music.
Pandora,Good music.,James K. Carnine,22-Dec-12,4,"Nice job of permitting selection/rejection of desired music. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. There!"
Pandora,Good music--the way I like it,Anita L. Moss,25-May-14,4,"I like Pandora because you can choose the songs, artists, genre, etc. that you most enjoy. You even have the choice of liking or not a particular arrangement of a favorite song. Very helpful in providing background music while working."
Pandora,Great Selection,Amazon Customer,28-Aug-16,5,Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music.
Pandora,screw pandora,Michael Hassoldt,11-Jul-16,1,"too many ads, and the company is way to political. Screw you pandora."
Pandora,But not nearly as good as,Amazon Customer,6-Mar-16,3,Can't pick specific songs ...  Volume is inconsistent... OK ... But not nearly as good as Spotify
Pandora,It's Alright,Wendy Trevino,30-Dec-16,4,"The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I'm listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I don't think you shouldn't get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem."
Pandora,Love Pandora!,Donald Greenberg,17-Aug-13,5,"I love music and Pandora makes it really easy to listen to the music I love.  Where else can I get my BB King fix while I exercise at the gym?  Okay, so every once in a while I have to listen to a commercial, so what?  On typical broadcast radio there are many, many more commercials and the music generally is....(can I say this?) crap!Another great feature is that I can listen to Pandora at home on my Roku."
Pandora,Definitely improved!,realmary,12-Sep-14,5,"Originally, when I reviewed Pandora I gave it one star due to too many commercials. Since I've gotten my Echo I noticed that problem has greatly improved! Pandora listened and now the commercials are manageable."
Pandora,Love it,Tessa,7-Jan-14,5,I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want.  I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I'm in for the day.  I have my workout music on one station and I don't have to worry about skipping thru the songs.
Pandora,Gr8 App!,J. D&iacute;az,25-Aug-12,5,"Pandora is such a great app on KF, been using it for awhile now it is really outstanding how selective playlists can be organized for your pleasure. Only complaint is when are you pushing their latest update on Amazon app store, it is available now on Google play don't know why Amazon takes ages for updates on Android apps which are already out."
Pandora,Review,Ken B.Avraham,15-Jul-16,4,The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's.
Pandora,its bad,Dawn Lombardi,24-Jun-13,2,its ok but if u type in the song you want to hear you wont even get to hear it. plus if you type in the artist you willnget other artists not even in the same genre. I reccomend the app tune In although you cant listen to the song you want you can listen to radio stations worldwide plus its free
Pandora,stop with the ads,J. Haynes,7-Aug-13,3,"Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."
Pandora,Can't understand.,James,12-Jan-12,5,I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could.
Pandora,pandora is always good,Pen Name,18-Jul-15,5,I been using the app for 5 yrs now and still running strong. After using it for time I I'll buy the full version with out commercial it's a good app
Pandora,I really like it when it will play,Amazon Customer,3-May-16,1,"I really like it when it will play, but it stops after it's been playing for 10 minutes and then it plays for a few seconds and shuts off again."
Pandora,Now better than I Heart Radio,Jeccaamato,7-Sep-12,5,"Pandora was a pain, so was using I Heart. Since the update, so much better. Easier to navigate, lists the lyrics, love the selection of stations and music. Created a station I love. But if you are looking for more eclectic artists and to discover new tunes, stick with I Heart. Also love if there's a song I hate,I never have to hear it again."
Pandora,Excellence in Every Way!,Angela,8-Oct-12,5,The absolutely best music service available.  I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres.  Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week.  I just love Pandora!
Pandora,GREAT  APP,J. Johnson-Price,8-Dec-14,4,Pandora. is a really good app but the one thing I do not like is the stations for.example I create a beyonce station and it plays a bunch of others artists songs but other than that its great
Pandora,A really nice app.:,Amazon Customer,26-Jul-12,5,I like it even though there are some repetitive ads. (whats up with that kroger one?) And that sometimes songs I dont like come on but I am a big fan of the thumbs up and down thing. That is very helpful. Overall I like this app although I am still pondering over the fact that I type in the fray and get a country song. But I still love this app..
Pandora,Works most times,zimmy,31-Mar-13,3,"I don't use these type of apps often because I have over 50000 songs in my cloud, but when I do use Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD, it works most times. Seems to stop playing after a few hours though and has commercials. When I use on my LG home theater (built into that) it never plays commercials and never quits until I turn it off. Not bad though for a free music radio. I tend to use Songza more often on the Fire HD then this one though."
Pandora,Love it :),MSandy02,30-Mar-12,4,"I like Pandora a lot because I love listening to music and whenever I gotta work or do stuff, I just listen to it. I can make new stations and if I don't like a song, just put thumbs down. But it's kinda annoying how they have the same old commercials over and over again. They should try to put other commercials as well, or not at all. I prefer no commercials :)"
Pandora,Lexi(:,A. Norton,10-Jun-13,5,"Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."
Pandora,Pandora is amazing!,h.campo,28-Nov-15,5,"This app is amazing because you can listen to your favorite music and, you could also hi on a run at the same time."
Pandora,not too happy,Martin Perez,9-Feb-16,1,Don't enjoy the concept of signing into an app on my BlackBerry.  Was not working well w the z 30.
Pandora,Pandora is perfect radio,Bill,29-Aug-16,5,"Perfect Free Radio, i listen to it all dayat work. Easy dashboard. Subscription well worth it to get radio witout commercial interruptiin.Try new bands without spending money"
Pandora,Good,I am awesome,17-Mar-14,4,I love the way you can make your own personal stations but I don't like how you have to create an account and you have to have wifi to play music. but if you have wick and don't mind creating a free account then get this app it is satisfying.
Pandora,MUSIC!,Kristen Smith,4-Apr-13,5,I love having music and a variety of it. I don't buy cds or anything anymore and the regular radio plays too much of the same things or have too many commercials/talk shows. I may have the free version but the commercials really are not intrusive and I can easily look over it. I like to be surprised with songs that I love but may not have heard in awhile or didn't know who did them.
Pandora,Great!,GLOCKer,25-Apr-16,5,"Works like the Pandora on my phone!  I downloaded it, fired up my smoker, and listened to Blues music while smoking dinner and drinking Tennessee Whiskey."

Pandora,Pandora's  broken,inkysweet,4-Dec-12,1,"I really used to love this app but recent updates have made my kindle fire unstable and the ads have been regularly crashing the app.  Also, the ads have become more frequent.  I could probably deal with if they worked properly and music would resume after they finished.  Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend this app."
Pandora,Pandora,Gordon Hutchison,21-Dec-12,4,I can play the artist I like.  Being a 1940s' guy I can get the big band music I enjoy and the vocalist of the 40s' singing music that you can actually understand.

Pandora,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,9-Aug-16,3,i could live without commercials and limit of skips
Pandora,AMAZING!!!,Adam Davis,27-Feb-12,5,"I'm a musician, and I've tried Internet Radios before, but this one is by far my favorite. I don't see why people are complaining, everything it plays is based off the information you give the program. The only thing I'm left wishing for is being able to see the lyrics like you can on the we site. But other than that, this is definitely worth the download."
Pandora,anyway a good app to relax and be happy because you can listen all types music,reina AlcÃ¡ntara,12-May-14,4,is a great app for adults and kids to listen all types of music but the only problem is that when you want to change from radio station stock and you cant changed and have to wait until done the last song that you listening
Pandora,What Happened,M.Stobert,8-Jul-13,2,I just got a new kindle and re downloaded everything and Pandora so many new limits it sucks so bad like only 40 hours free mobile listening and only 6 skips total per day what happened to 6 skips per station per day uuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhh Pandora used to be my favorite music app

Pandora,Love it paid or free,ishKiia,22-Jan-12,5,"What can I say about Pandora.  It's always been fair about paid and free subscriptions.  The free version is a great marketing tactic.  It keeps the name brand up and for those that pay like I have in the past, it's awesome with awesome features.  I'm currently running the free one again due to finances but I still enjoy the great service Pandora has to offer."
Pandora,AWSOME!!!!!!,lilly bell,20-May-14,5,This is an awesome app you can get your own music! This has nothing to do with this app but thee one thing that I hats is that the kindle makes thou put in a rule about how many words you can have when you write a review.

My reoccurring subsicription ends on 8/6/2016, and will not be renewed.Pandora's support of Black Lives Matter is very  short sighted.

Any company, business, or group supporting BLM should be avoided."

Pandora,pandora rocks,Joseph Lefchuk,20-May-13,5,"pandora is a really cool game for music you can pick any radio station you want, learn about the singer and see lyrics. also if you don't like a song u can hit thumbs down and it will never play it again. I love this app but the only thing I hate is that you can't pick your song."
Pandora,pandora for blackberry,David Tobin,26-Jun-15,5,"Finally, the Pandora app through Amazon apps on Blackberry Z10! Works great no more going through the browser and getting kicked out."
Pandora,From a 5 star to 1 star because it now locks up!!!,jbsloop,11-Dec-12,1,"Pandora WAS awesome and rated 5 stars, UNTIL the most recent update. Now it freezes up my Kindle Fire every few song and that makes it virtually unusable. It will remain a 1 star until they fix the 'improvements'."

Pandora,Pretty good most the time,Erin Gibson,17-Dec-13,3,"On my kindle fire it skips the last half of the song a lot and pauses randomly, its not that I have bad internet connection because I had all bars.

Pandora,Five Stars,PJ,13-Nov-16,5,I truly enjoy Pandora!
Pandora,<3,life is slow...,20-Jun-12,5,I love pandora! I use it on my kindle fire and on my laptop with the website. I don't really understand why other people r having so much trouble it whilst it is simple to use. the commercials that come w/ the free one r small and don't bother w/ the song. <3 dat u can do other stuff like web surfing while listening to pandora
Pandora,Love it!,peyton,22-Sep-12,5,I love Pandora! I use it all the time and it provides a great selection of music unlike the radio which repeats constantly. A bunch of people say they don't like it because of the adds; but there is a thirty second or less add every five or more songs; so that is not a good complaint. I give it five stars completly!
Pandora,annoying,Viva,25-Sep-14,3,i used to love it but now it seems that when I hit thumbs up I never here the song again and it never plays songs related to the songs I like just irrelevant songs and songs I don't like
Pandora,What else is there to say? Pandora is fantastic,Jennifer Gott,6-Nov-12,5,"This delivers music with very little ads. But music that YOU pick, you ""like"" and you might not yet know, but may grow to love. It's free content for the cost of listen to an ad or two every five or six songs and REALLY free if you use it over wi-fi and not on your limited data plan smart phone. So much fun!"
Pandora,I love not having to listen to commercials,DAN MCCARTHY,14-Dec-16,4,"I love not having to listen to commercials, skipping all the music I don't want to listen to. This is a good deal."
Pandora,da best,C. Triplett,3-Jun-12,5,"Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music!  you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like,  I love it && I'm positive u will too :)"
Pandora,Dunno why you hatin.,Roxas Nobody,7-Mar-12,5,I dunno why everyone here is saying it sucks on the kindle fire. Its awesome on the KF and the music comes out very clearly and smoothly. I've never had to deal with a force close with Pandora and although commercials do occur they are not as constant as many people lead first-time Pandora users to believe. Do not fall to the lies children!!!
Pandora,Love the variety!,Mary,4-Sep-13,4,"After adding artists I can listen to many different genres of music....and so like the feature that tells me why they chose a particular song, or how it is like the music of the artists I have selected"
Pandora,Could be a little better,Michael Le Clech,16-Nov-12,4,"The android app doesn't let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I don't like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!"
Pandora,One Star,Amazon Customer,3-Jan-17,1,It doesn't work
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,2-Jan-17,5,very good

Pandora,AMAZING!!!!!,azar,15-Apr-12,5,Pandora is so much better than the iheart radio app. it is simple. fun. and when I want to makemy own radio all i have to do is type one song that I like and then it is like it reads my mind because it gives me all of my fav. songs. amazing. if you have a doubt about buying this app don't. it is totally worth it. makes me feel so good.
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,23-Jan-17,5,LOVE it.
Pandora,love it,am,8-Jan-13,4,I love this app. it can get a little glitchy at times but for the most part runs smoothly. if I do have trouble with a station I just switch the station or restart the app. its a great companion for when I get bored of the music I have. nice way to learn of new artists. I definitely reccomend it.

Pandora,amazing,Chelsea E.,3-Sep-14,5,I think that this is a great app I have it on all of my electronics and it has all different types of music for all different types of people I love this app and I think you should get it.
Pandora,ptetty good,S.Wenzel,15-May-12,3,"it is a good app and has new and current music (I should know from being a teenager) but the only problem is that it only allows you to use 6 skips per hour per station :( ugh that makes me mad cause there could be a song that was made in the 70's and I cant skip it. but overall, its a good app :)Jesus loves ya""ll"

Pandora,how do you not have this already?,MT_Lightning,18-Jul-12,5,this app is awesome.  works with Pandora online and you can sync so your stations online are available on kindle.  needs confirmation that you are still listening about every 3-4 hours.  stays on without screen so you can listen longer or at night.  does have ads play but it's maybe a couple an hour.  small price to pay
Pandora,Love my Pandora!,ArizonaBorn,21-Dec-11,5,"Interesting that this free radio is called ""pandora"". . . . It is a box full of music of every genre you can imagine.  I have Pandora on my home and work computers, my android phone, and now my Kindle Fire!  If you go over your minutes for the month, it only costs you $0.99 to continue the ""free"" music.

Pandora,skip,mandi,2-Nov-13,3,This app is great and all but sometimes I notice it skips songs. I look to see what song is playing and I see in frount of that song is one of my favorite songs was played before this song and I'm positive I would know when my song is played.

Pandora,excellent,Cathy Vesota,5-Dec-13,5,this app is the best.  Just put in a song you like and it will play that song & songs similar to it.  You can create lots of stations - pick some of their own/hardly Any commercials - just a very cool way to rock out to tunes.  Love it

Pandora,Great Music Choices,GMom N,10-Jun-14,5,I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I'm at work.  There's such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste.  The songs play more clearly than my radio in work which tends to fade in and out because of being in a high office building.  I would recommend this application to people of all ages.

Pandora,Pandora and Phil Keaggy,Terry,25-Oct-14,5,"Pandora was found when I was looking for a particular musician. Phil Keaggy to be specific. Paul McCartney identified Phil as the world's greatest classical guitarist a number of years ago, and the amazing thing about Keaggy is that he only has nine fingers! Anyway, I found Keaggy's music on Pandora and have been listening ever since!"
Pandora,music discovery,Eric,12-Oct-12,5,"Pandora has been my number one app since my first smart phone.  I have discovered so much new music with this service.

Pandora,needs better songs,Kindle Customer,14-Apr-12,3,It really needs better songs the one they put on know are bad and old u hear if about a billion songs they never put on the songs that are new like rumor has it or boyfriend or one direction or anything new you will probably heat songs from more then 5 or 6 years ago but some songs might be ok. So I would so its a ok app!!!

Pandora,"time limit too short, otherwise an awesome app",z,13-Apr-13,4,There is a 40 hour limit to listening to the music on this app. I ran out of time in 3 days. I don't want to pay to upgrade so I'm stuck. That's the bad news  the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps

Pandora,4 star royal review,Amazon Customer,26-Dec-13,4,I got this app because I always use Pandora on my other devises when I am useong that device some of my kids use it. I do like this app i only gave it 4 stars because it is kinda hard to navigate this app on the Kindel Fire.
Pandora,Could be easier,john w millington,11-Sep-17,3,Not very easy to call up the artist (s) that I like. Could be easier but still cuts out the music that I don't care for. Radio bombards me with hours of blech for a few that I would choose. I'll keep it and maybe get better at manipulating it
Pandora,new update,Clyde R.,5-Sep-12,5,I use this app every day. I love it. earlier I got a new update. this update has much more than before. now Ill use it whenever possible.
Pandora,perfect for Pandora lovers like myself,J. Kiesel,19-May-12,5,"I love the Pandora service, whenever I can I'm listening to Pandora One, it provides me with the music I like that I cant find anywhere else and provides a constant tune to my life.  I have discovered many fantastic artists and listened to well over 2000 hours, thanks Pandora for providing such an amazing service :)"

Pandora,WHY THE CHANGE???,ginnyntenn,19-Sep-12,2,I have been a Pandora fan for quite a while and I absolutely hats their new format. That is why I have given it a 2 star rating. It plays fine on the Kindle Fire. I just can't access my favorites or anything. Will be finding me another radio channel until Pandora gets this crape straightened out.

Pandora,I Love It!,Ms. Awesome,9-Jul-13,4,"Often I like music, but can't identify the artist.  This app allows me to do that.  In addition, it provides me with ""like"" artists; music of the same genre or by the same artist which I would not necessarily seek out.  I love these features."
Pandora,eclectic taste in a wide genre of musical taste seems difficult for Pandora,SEAllard,6-Jan-17,4,I would rather choose just the artist I select...rather than Pandora choosing other artists they think I might like to hear too.
Pandora,not available in this country?,:-),17-Feb-14,1,"I read a lot of the reviews for Pandora and thought I finally found the music app made just for me. it looked amazing. Apparently, its not available in all countrys, and my country happens to be one of them. :("

Every day I meet new talented artists I have never encountered before since creating listening stations as diverse as Early Latin Jazz to New Age Instrumental and Liz Story to Bluegrass.What a delight to find music appropriate for the holiday seasons, too.Thank you, Pandora!"
Pandora,Pandora is an awesome application!,Kip D. Dietrich,21-Dec-11,5,"Pandora is the best of the radio applications.  It is free and works very well, even in the car!Anyone I have shown this application to has been very impressed and installed it immediately.  Congratulations on a job well done to the makers of Pandora.  As a reward, I signed up for Pandora One.  Look into it.  You won't be sorry."
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,10-Nov-17,5,Great app and you can't beat the price
Pandora,Love it!!,Tiffany C. Weiland,6-Oct-12,5,"What more can I say?  I love Pandora for the music varieties it provides.  I am  not much a station hopper, so once I set the type of music, mostly classical, the numbers of music come through are satisfying.  Furthermore, the quality of sound is impecable - it is definitely one of my favs."
Pandora,Didnt Work,Julia,25-Aug-13,1,I downloaded this app for my kindle fire. When I opened it nothing happened. I tried deleting it and re-downloading it - it still did not work. It just shows the opening Pandora screen and never does anything else. Just a tad bit annoying!
Pandora,stupid,this is a really fun app for all ages,7-Aug-15,1,Won't let me play music for some unknown reason and if I could give zero stars I would. This app sucks
Pandora,One Star,DJ Foodie,11-Jul-16,1,Same old stuff all the time

Pandora,I love pandora but...,Christine Spaulding,7-Mar-13,4,I have been using Pandora for months to listen to music at work. I didn't care that there were advertisements since it was free. Now they are limiting the free music to 40 hours per month. I will find a new app for listening to music at work. I'm very disappointed.
Pandora,Amazing App,Abbey,23-Nov-14,5,I love this app because its free music! Who doesn't love free music! I suggest this app for everyone!I would not waste your time getting this App

Pandora,I love this app!,Charla,30-Sep-12,5,"I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I've also discovered some new artists that I've never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up."
Pandora,Four Stars,Darlene Bartel,25-Feb-16,4,I love it. pick your own music and its free!!!!!!!!!!!
Pandora,ok,thatgirlwhoratesthings,17-Aug-13,4,"This is a great app. But, it would be even better if you could keep listening to the same song over and over again. That is why I just gave it 4 stars. Sometimes it doesn't work, though. Otherwise it is the best music app in my opinion."
Pandora,love it,karen polascak,22-Dec-15,5,I love this app it just plays songs without you having to select one
Pandora,Music Fun,rachael,30-Dec-14,5,Want a free music app that plays your favorite artists and songs? Pandora is great for you. One catch.... you need wifi like most other apps.

Pandora,"I love Pandora, listen all the time on my kindle",Amazon Customer,17-Feb-16,5,"I love Pandora , listen all the time on my kindle fire"
Pandora,Adds freeze kindle,nayrwolf,10-Dec-12,1,I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you aren't actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come.
Pandora,Music for ME,Patricia L.M,12-Aug-13,5,"It is so wonderful to listen to music I love, the words I can hear and even sing along.....the best part I choose the music and it is there for me....always.  I have heard songs that I have not heard in YEARS!!!  The best part it is FREE!!!!"
Pandora,Can't view bookmarks,greg,13-May-12,2,this is a great app and all but the one thing it is missing is viewing the bookmarks.  there is absolutely no options to view your bookmarks.  I want to check out the songs and artists that I bookmarked but sadly I can't.  Please Pandora fix this issue on your app in order to make this app great again.
Pandora,great,ginger,4-Sep-14,4,great way to enjoy personalized music.  you pick what you like and don't like and it customizes itself to you like a well tailored outfit.  nothing can beat this.
Pandora,PANDORA IS HORRIBLE,Kelley McCarter,10-Dec-13,1,Pandora is horrible!! Its slow!! It laggggs really bad. I wanted to purchase Pandora 1 but its not worth the $4 a month to listen to silence!!
Pandora,Four Stars,RetiredHsMom,6-Mar-16,4,"I like it, but not enough to buy a subscription."
Pandora,Launches when it wants too,Char,25-Dec-13,2,"I don't know how many time I've remove Pandora from my kindle only to reinstall it. Of course, after reinstall it works but I shouldn't have to uninstall it for it to work. Idk, maybe it this darn kindle fire."

Pandora,Why is everyone so negative?,Greg,10-Sep-12,5,This app is just fine. I really don't see why people are so negative. It plays my music uninterrupted without problem. Who cares if it plays the same advertisement over and over? It isn't after every song like other reviewers said. Don't read the negative reviews. Try it for yourself.
Pandora,i love it,P.goad,1-Oct-15,5,I think this app is the best app ever that I have ever had I like to listen to mgk
Pandora,AWESOME,pamela j ripley,7-Dec-14,5,PANDORA IS AWESOME BECAUSE YOU GET TO LISTEN TO HOT SONGS LIKE BLANK SPACE BY TAILOR SWIFT.PANDORA IS AMAZING!!!!!!100% +AMAZING=AWESOME
Pandora,Poor quality!,Charlie,31-Dec-14,2,"If you don't upgrade and pay for it, the music is intermittent even if you're not on any other sites at the same time.Poor quality!"
Pandora,meh,Kat Tawny,26-Apr-13,4,"I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me"
Pandora,like it,awesome,6-May-13,4,I love this its better then youtube and music on your apple devices but comercials seriously on a music app that's stupid but that's all I have to complain about. all u have 2 do is stop with the commercials we see enough of those on Tv........ :)
Pandora,I just kick back and listen,BRILLO MAN,24-May-14,5,"I just kick back and listen to my favorite tunes.  I'm 63 years old still working and when I come home from work, I pick up my tablet and go to Pandora, start it up, start listening. I like 60's 70's and 80's.  I then go to my favorite media outlets (you know what they are), read through those while listening.  I haven't heard a bad song yet."
Pandora,Best FREE music app ever,coolness 28,5-Feb-13,5,"Pandora lets you listen to music ANY type you want. You create your own station of music any genre,  type,  artist,  song,  or anything!!!!! All it requires is Internet access!!! Well if you haven't already got this app from reading the first sentence get it!!!"
Pandora,Great App,Kizmet64,29-Apr-13,4,"I like this app and the music you can listen too.  Once you've chosen your genre, it will keep suggestions and songs coming.  I do wish Kindle had a better speaker but the sound is not bad and you can listen to your songs without disturbing others."
Pandora,Pandora,bluerose,3-Dec-13,5,I have been a member of Pandora as long as they have been available. If you want a music station with no useless information or interruptions
Pandora,Love it!!!,Allahisgod,29-Dec-11,4,"This app is the best for music. The options on the type of stations you want to listen to and mix them is great. Ideal for a person who likes a variety of music. Only 2 downsides is that you will be listening all day while you are supposed to be doing something else and the commercials, but it's overall fantastic."
Pandora,Amazing,jc,4-Dec-13,5,I think this is the best way to listen to music. You could have all the songs you want but on phones people by there favorite music when you can get it free right on Pandora. In my opinion I think it's amazing!
Pandora,Sucks no volume,Brandy King.,17-Jan-16,2,Does not play at all on kindle 10 fire do not waste time
Pandora,Love it! :),Amazon Customer,7-Dec-12,5,"This app is an amazing app! I love! When I do my homework this is an awesome app because I cant live without music. When music is on, while I'm doing my homework it takes a half hour. And without music it takes me an hour. But I love to dance to it to. I LOVE MUSIC! :)"
Pandora,Best music APP,Amazing,24-Jul-17,5,Try it out its with it
Pandora,Five Stars,Clay,5-Mar-16,5,"At this point, it might as well be a classic."
Pandora,sorry people who like this app,K.Johnson,9-Sep-12,3,well I'm a huge owl city fan and Taylor swift but when I got those Radios it would be songs like spongebob(I'm not lying )and stuff.I mean spongebob rocks but has nothing to do with Taylor Swift or Owl City.But other then not putting the right songs on the stations it was a ok app.
Pandora,I like it because I can chose what music I want ...,flintfire,21-Jul-15,5,I like it because I can chose what music I want to hear.  They seem to have all kinds of music.
Pandora,Five Stars,Caroline Mullins,30-Jun-17,5,I love Pandora and its music choices
Pandora,Cant Work in Italy's,alexrae,9-Dec-13,1,"I live in Italy and when I first opened this app I was really exited. Then it said ""Pandora is not available in this country"" I am very dissapointed. For those with my problem I suggest iheartradio."
Pandora,loved it till recently. plays one song and freezes. i have to quit (close app) and reopen....just to hear one song and Repeat!,Moonstone,1-Dec-12,2,Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution.
Pandora,love,Kenneth Vanvalkenberg,16-May-15,5,I loved it because when netflix is not working I just put this on and play games then my games stop working.
Pandora,free muisc,evelyn,25-Jul-14,3,this is a great app but there are to many breaks from the muisc and I think we should be albe. to skip as much song as we want but other then that it is a great app.
Pandora,Good for what I want,Kathy,26-Sep-17,4,Good music. Many ads.
Pandora,ok,cool game bro,17-Nov-13,4,I like it a lot but I don't like how you can only skip a couple. songs at a time but besides that I love it oh and one more thing I don't like how you have you but your both date some kids under 13 want Pandora.
Pandora,Great Music!,PegLeg,19-Dec-13,5,"Non-stop, no interruptions and great for me since I'm spoiled and have Sirius XM in my car so naturally I would want the same when I'm home>  And I can even enjoy my favorite genre of music..fantastic!"
Pandora,amazing,HammerHead,1-Feb-14,5,this app is a must have for all music lovers! it lets you create personalized stations and doubles as a social media type thing so you can listen to music and talk to friends that also use Pandora.
Pandora,GREAT,W. T. Whitehouse,8-Jan-14,5,I like background music and can't stand ads.  By using this app I can select the kind of music I like or in the mood for and turn it up. The adds on the free app are short and don't come on very often.
Pandora,i like it,Donna L. Knaub,31-Jul-15,4,pandora is a great app for people who like music. i personally loved it so so so so so much

Pandora,love love love,oreo'smom,18-Mar-14,5,Absolutely the best if you want to hear your favorite music and definitley worth upgrading to listen commerical free! Lets you listen to so many different genres of music.
Pandora,to many pop up adds,ms,10-Mar-14,1,"the music is fine , but keep getting pop up adds for every entry I make. I think I will try other sights for tunes."
Pandora,doesnt make sense,Julius C Sirmons,5-Dec-12,2,"I was listening to a station while doing my homework and skipped a song and the previous song wad still playing. so know I was stuck listening to a song that I don't want. and also every time I skip a song, the same spainish ad came on..ready to delete next screw up"

Pandora,LISTEN UP! !!!!,establisher,26-May-13,5,This is a good app but the app wont get you to your exact song. This app is not that organized but plays reallly good songs. This app allows you to skip up to 6 songs each station your on. This is a great music app I highly reccomend it.

I turn it on in the morning and listen to it literally all day long I have 25+ ""stations"". I have used a lot of different radio apps and I have paid for a few including slacker radio. but this one actually does not drop and buffers nicely."
Pandora,Spend a few dollars and get commercial free!,Christine,27-Dec-12,5,Love Pandora! I splurged and spend the extra $9.95 to get rid of the commercials and it was a very satisfying move! Love having the extra music to play. I have a large music library but I am always finding new artists on Pandora that I would never have heard.
Pandora,what happened?,lisareview,7-Aug-15,4,"Pandora was awesome on my Kindle Fire...until yesterday. Still plays great on my iPhone but sucks on Kindle!! Please fix, I beg you."
Pandora,If you like using Pandora then its awesome,Joe,12-Oct-16,4,"It's Pandora's music app for Amazon OS. If you like using Pandora then its awesome, if you hate Pandora then you'll hate it."

Pandora,absolutly awesome service,G. D.,24-Oct-11,5,i have love pandora ever since the first time i have heard of the service. it is not for everyone i admit because not everyone is interested in find new artists that are almost identical to the songs/artists they love. but if you want to expand your harizons of artists and genres this is the perfect app for you.
Pandora,Good app,matt botset,31-Mar-15,4,Does what I want it to do and more. I have had no problems with it so far and look forward to using it often.
Pandora,good,lol,27-Jul-13,5,"you'll love it. the only let down is that you need wifi for it to work. I use it a lot so its nice that they made it portable . I feel that if they tried a little harder, they could make so that you wouldn't need internet."
Pandora,AWESOME,m&amp;e,3-Jul-12,5,this app is great. I love it! You just put your favorite songs and then it plays songs that are like it! you can also like songs to play them again later or you can do thumbs down so it will skip the song you don't like and it will never play it again. Hope you like this app I loved it.
Pandora,"Incredibly diverse music library, everywhere you are, for a pittance!",Pkboo,28-Mar-16,5,"I must have music as much as I need to breathe.

I haven't had this issue before. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?"
Pandora,OMG The best.,Cloudy In Sunny CA,20-Feb-12,5,"Even the free version is great. You barely notice the ads, and the commercials are few and far between and short. Just give it an idea of what you like (thumbs up) and it takes it. If you don't like a song, thumbs down, and it goes away. I actually turned off the Tv and started listening instead."

Pandora,Terrible recently,Maharickie,9-Oct-13,1,"I would give pandora 5 stars, it's an awesome way to listen to music, if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on, listen to one song, turn it off, and try again and it won't work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it, but I've used already this time? Shut down my kindle, and hope it works."
Pandora,i like this,Jet,7-Sep-13,4,"The only thing I do not like is the ability to pick a song when your on your station . At least I have a hard time ,"

I use Pandora all the time - on my computer at home and at work, on my kindle, my phone, ipod - It is by far my favorite app."
Pandora,I really dont understand,Kindle Customer,11-Dec-12,5,Why is every one complaining about the commercials? Do you guys realize that Pandora makes virtually no reasonable profit from providing this FREE service? Where else can you listen to the music of your choice for free? The radio? Come on people cut these guys some slack.
Pandora,Four Stars,Chris D,28-Feb-16,4,All my favorite music.  I like it.
Pandora,Five Stars,Kris Beer,7-Jun-16,5,superb music
Pandora,Love it,njstry,10-Apr-15,5,Pandora is fabulous.  You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music.  It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time.
Pandora,pandora,Ema Galvan,11-Jan-14,4,I truly like pandora i like that it plays different people close to the singer so i can learn new artist sometimes they put a little bit to much adds but rather than that i think its great!

Pandora,in your country,dafuq,5-Oct-13,3,"Pandora is in this country,  it was working an hour ago in Kyrgyzstan. Then I tried adding a playlist and it stopped working. So my problem is why don't you want it to work over seas you greedy pieces feces"
Pandora,refresh-ing,MJ,18-Aug-13,1,"Had to refresh after every song. Very frustrating! Don't think it was my fault either, if it was my Droid, shame on Pandora for having such a bad app."

Pandora,Exactly what I need,John,7-Nov-11,5,"Does a good job of playing customized radio stations on my phone. It has a great balance of playing the general type of music that I want to hear while still giving plenty of variety so the music stays fresh.The app used to crash on occasion, but the current version appears to have fixed that problem."
Pandora,My Music=),Cat Castaneda,5-Apr-13,5,"I love Pandora so much. I love being able to listen to what I want to and skip the songs I don't like! I also like putting my opinion out there by leaving a comment like "" I love this song so much"" so I hope that those of you reading this will be inspired to get the app and ENJOY=)"
Pandora,The only complaint is customer sreviews is not so good. It is very hard to get a live ...,Anita Vandergriff,11-Dec-14,5,The only complaint is customer sreviews is not so good.  It is very hard to get a live person right away when needed.
Pandora,Good App,Leigh-Ann,20-Mar-12,4,"Good app to help you find artists and songs that are similar to ones that you already know and like. Type in an artist and Pandora will play songs from them and others in the same gendre. The only complaint is the ads, and not being able to skip songs as much as I would like to sometimes."
Pandora,"If you love music, get this app",Windmere,28-Mar-12,5,Wonderful concept.  A must have for music lovers.  Determines what kind of new music you might like based on your preferred artist.

Pandora,great music,Ray Hernandez,11-Jan-14,5,"I like 90-95% of the music I hear, I think it's great, keep playing the good stuff. I really don't mind the commercialsbecause they allow you to get up and get a drink or something."
Pandora,Great free ap,Amazon Customer,28-Aug-17,5,Knows a lot of tunes
Pandora,too many ad's,Greg Davis,13-Dec-14,1,Way too many ad's and didn't have some stations I was looking for. Spotify is way better they have less ad's and more music
Pandora,love it but....,s Noland,21-Aug-13,3,This app is great I used to use it every night but in the morning it take w or e minutes to shut it off. first you have to push the still listening then when the music starts AGAIN you have to shut off the add then you have to go to your channel. list and click the button to open the menu to shut it off. and its all deliberate so you will buy the pay service. No thanks I'll. just use something else.
Pandora,amazing,tigerlily,23-Dec-14,5,"love this app, love the different stations and the alarm clock. There is so many songs and its amazing . olive this app."
Pandora,One Star,Sharon Poulin,9-Oct-17,1,Can't get good songs
Pandora,"like it, but has its flaws",Dave W,15-Nov-11,4,"I have the paid version.  the free version became pointless because of the commercials, just like spotify and terrestrial radio.  the biggest flaw of pandora in the android/fire version is the lack of a way to filter out bands that you don't like...unless it's right in front of me and I didn't see it."
Pandora,I FREAKIN LOVE IT,Catlover,15-Jul-15,5,This app gives you the opportunity to listen to free music. Plus you can listen to any artist. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET THE BEST APP EVER PANDORA!And you can play minecraft with pandora. LoL I'm even listening to pandora as I write this.

Pandora,It's ok!,Mramazin85,1-Aug-13,3,I had the app before and stopped using it. Just got back on and it's better but the purpose of creating a certain artist station is to only listen to that artist. I hear music completely different from the artist
Pandora,it's just awsome,Jim,20-Dec-14,5,You can type any song Holiday and even artist  it's completely amazing!!!  I do not know if you can make your own tho:)

Pandora,it's ok - no radioio for selection but ok.,pat duffy,13-Feb-14,3,it's ok so far.  not sure if Silk is the issue but while listinening in the background and browsing other sites Pandora has quit playing.  that is annoying and shouldn't happen.
Pandora,horrid,Amazon Customer,9-Dec-12,1,"no longer do I wish to waste my time with this ixmpecible app. as a music app critic, I have heard and used every app for music known. in all of my career this has been one of the most repolsive. no sound ever Ã§ame even with the volume on Max. I was declined of severally stations and the same song plays every ten minutes. if u r looking for an app worth the time, continue ur search by pressing back and scrolling to other options"
Pandora,permissions,rrunswickjr,5-Dec-11,3,"Why does this application need access to permissions such as my contact list in order to play music?It is a known issue on the iOS version of the application- tracking personally identifiable information such as GPS coordinates.  I find it astonishing that the company has made no comment to the tech news press about why they need such information, or why it has to be pinged so frequently.  I understand that they need general location data for advertisements, but ""up to the minute"" is completely unnecessary.  What is this company up to?"
Pandora,why?!?!?!,ringo,23-Dec-14,2,I tried typing inky password but it said no I hav has thia beforw now I wont let mw use it!!!!!!!!!like;sereiosly!!!!
Pandora,great with pandora one,S_Mills,24-Sep-12,5,I love this app. I must say that I was shocked at the one star reviews but then I noticed they complained about ads. I don't have those problems because of Pandora one. I have not experienced it cutting off songs either. perhaps they have fixed those errors.

Pandora,It's OK,good game,13-Dec-12,3,Like the stars say it's okay but it really makes me mad when in the middle of a REALLY good song and it crashes. Now I used too use Pandora EVERYDAY but now it gets on my nerves... I'm think about a different music app... It TRUELY is a shame...
Pandora,Good when it works,Josh,30-Mar-16,3,"I often have to hard-exit whenever I loose cell data connection... Connection comes back but Pandora won't play....The last update broke Pandora...

Pandora,pandora,Carolyn,3-Feb-14,4,I think that Pandora is a great app and would recommend it to anybody but the one thing that pisses me off is how after you skip a couple songs they wont let you skip anymore
Pandora,what i think about pandora,J. Appleseed,25-Mar-15,5,I love Pandora! it has great music and it cost no money. I think Pandora is great for my kindle.

Pandora,40 Hour Listening Cap- ARE YOU CRAZY?????,PaganDeva2000,3-Jun-13,1,"I used to LOVE Pandora!  Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW.  For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month.  Are you for real??  With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU $3.99???  Take a powder, Pandora!I started using RADITAZ, people!!!  Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour.  Even has a carosel for songs.  So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio (free version).  Pandora must be INSANE!!"

I thought it was my Kindle but the button works fine on my phone and other devices. I have to shut down to close it.  I may be  crazy and it's only me with this issue but is there anyone else having this problem?"

Pandora,Could be better,Richard T Batteese,30-Dec-13,4,"I would like more choice for artist not just their popular songs, album list. After listening you begin to hear the same songs over and over again almost like commercial radio."
Pandora,review,shelly haberly,3-Feb-16,5,Pandora is an amazing app
Pandora,Better & Better,zack alvira,23-Jun-14,4,It just keeps getting better. Constantly making improvements. Pandora exceeds all expectations for quality and ease of use. Two words: awe some!
Pandora,I have a bit of trouble holding the stream..but I like the library of music,Anette Locey,25-Jan-13,4,I love the different venues of music to choose from..and I am in the middle of changing providers as the old one has no space left on satelite..so my computer is really slow..I can't wait to share this site with friends and family!
Pandora,i love it,michelle m czarnowski,10-Feb-14,5,ilove it it has great songs and you can look up what ever station you want and you can skip songs it is basically like your ipod but you don't have to pay for the songs
Pandora,The new update,M. Gray,5-Nov-13,4,I like the app. just after the last update I got it wont let me sign back. it just says it is having technical issues. to get on I have to uninstall the app and redownload it everytime.
Pandora,Best online music with a great app,Dazedcat,11-Feb-12,5,"There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version.  This app allows for both but if you don't have a subscription then expect commercials and popups.  The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
Pandora,my opinion,j.holzbauer,7-Nov-12,5,I think this app is amazing you can listen to your songs favorite songs withough having to buy them but you cant go back a song or resins to a part you miss and you have to hope you get a song you like that's really the only down sides though
Pandora,PrettyGood,Emily Noble,22-Feb-16,4,Too many ads though.
Pandora,One of the best apps ever.,Teresa A  Chambless,30-Mar-14,5,"I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy. The ads may be annoying, but you can update to premium, or just deal with the ads. Either way, it's still one of the best apps ever. Definitely recommend you getting this. Why not? It's free!"
Pandora,Five Stars,Sada Showell,24-Jun-17,5,love it
Pandora,AWESOME!!,Tasha sanchez,5-May-13,5,My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I reccomend this.
Pandora,its the best music app ever.,mamaJ,20-Dec-13,5,don't waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app.  its free also instead of paying
Pandora,I found it hard to navigate and find a particular ...,Zina Losey,8-Sep-14,1,"I found it hard to navigate and find a particular song. Also, I didn't expect it to use data charges when I play it through the app on my car."
Pandora,great music app!,petty25,22-Oct-12,5,this is a app I use everyday when I work out or just wanna listen to some good music. I like how you can listen to millions of songs without even touching your tablet it will find songs for you! its a great and handy app I highly recommend it.
Pandora,awesome music radio,mva,2-Dec-12,5,Pandora is the best music radio. you can listen to music whenever and whatever music you want to listen to. make up your own radio station and its awesome listen to all your favorite music. for those of you who love music get Pandora!!!!
Pandora,Oh so sleazy.,Lisette Hernandez,22-Nov-11,2,"Where should I start. 1. The app only works 45%ofthe time - it force closes or drops a song. 2. They put banners over all the buttons so you cant like skip pause etc. Oh and get this; the close button on the ad doesn't work just sends you right to the advertiser's site. Bravo, Pandora."
Pandora,awsome,j,22-May-13,5,u can make ur own stations (i mean like type like an artist and u get a station about them) u can like songs  plus u can skip a song u dont want to here. i love it i already have 84 stationsits pretty cool
Pandora,Forget broadcast radio,ctwhtail,28-Dec-12,4,"Pick a fav artist or song and build your stations.  Very few commercials on free version. Been using for years...no complaints. Almost as good as XM .Add some adult talk stations, like Opie & Anthony. Then 4 stars gets 5 stars."
Pandora,hmm,this is really fun,19-Aug-13,1,"This thing isn't letting me listen to music !! I haven't been able to for like 2 weeks !! I'm done, I'm going to another music app !!"
Pandora,The best,cheyboy,20-May-14,5,My Wife and I have so enjoyed using Pandora over many years and I can say not once has it not been there for us.Thank youRic
Pandora,Best Music App!,SmileyFace,11-Jun-13,5,"I have this app on my kindle fire, Ipod touch, & android phone! great music for different occasions. I love it! Works great on all of them! I suggest you get it & enjoy it :) free music for everyone!"
Pandora,Five Stars,J Callahan,14-Nov-17,5,We enjoy the music.  Especially Herb Alpert.
Pandora,just right,Amy Landers,26-Oct-14,5,You can pick any station. If you're bored you can chose any tile of music you like. When it's Sunday I turn on hymns.
Pandora,song choices are great.  Ads  played over the songs are not,Joe L.,24-Oct-11,3,I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying.  The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense.  Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background.
Pandora,fun music,taylor,9-Oct-14,5,I LOVE THE PANDORA MUSIC THATS WHY I USE THIS APP THE END what no DON'T GO RIGHT NOW OKAY NOW YOU CAN GO THE END FINNALY
Pandora,Five Stars,B&M,29-Mar-16,5,Love it!!
Pandora,I guess I was expecting something more,Cheryl,4-Jan-13,3,"I entered that I wanted to hear Lady Gaga.  I heard one Lady Gaga song and the rest were songs from all the pop princesses like Brittney Spears, Katy Perry, etc.  Then I entered I wanted to hear Little Big Town.  Once again, I heard two Little Big Town songs, and rest of the songs were just numerous other country singers, that I don't really care to hear.  I am a little disappointed.  I guess I was expecting to hear only the singers I requested."
Pandora,app learns what music i like,Candece Webster,23-Oct-11,5,"i love this app because not only doe it  learn what i like, but it also won't play that anoying song(s) i don't like. great to make a catagory for exercising, relaxing or driving in the car. i plug my phone into car  and it rocks! (mitsubishi lancer has plug to adapt phones to speakers)"
Pandora,problems,Kindle Customer,12-Dec-12,3,I think Pandora has a better music quality than iheart radio but I have problems switching stations. I often have more then one song playing at one time so I have to uninstall the app to get it to stop playing which is really annoying during school.
Pandora,Ads are way too annoying!,Penguin,17-Dec-12,1,"Sure its a free app, and I expect ads, but they are way too intrusive.And only having a limited number of song skips each hour is silly! Why should I have to listen to songs I don't like? Why do they even have that rule?"
Pandora,Nice n Dirty,higihuho,13-Jun-12,4,Love the radio.Don't ever belive the 1or 2 star reviews cuz they are NOT true.All I know is that the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I want clean music but I got dirty music.But don't take my word for it.Lets just say its 100% free and a great radio.
Pandora,Two Stars,Oscar,24-Oct-17,2,Too many commercials!
Pandora,Pandora's view,kabellview,25-Dec-11,4,"Pandora has been a companion for over nine months now, and I love it! It gives variety, and spice to life, from something to listen to while getting ready for work in the morning or working out in the gym. The latest to oldest music you can get your hands on. Thank you Pandora."
Pandora,"Its wonderful, except",A.Anderson,25-Nov-12,5,"I love the app, and when the kindle is plugged into the charger battery life isn't the problem. But after every two songs it plays the same annoying advertisement, I know that's how Pandora makes money. But come on, every two songs???"
Pandora,The Music you Love to Hear,Donna Safford,23-Dec-11,5,"I have been a Pandora fan for a long time. This product enables you to put in the name of a person or group and then listen to their music as well as music in the same genre. You are then able to ""like"" or ""dislike"" each song, helping Pandora create a great experience for you."
Pandora,for kindle,Mz.Teria(SSW),12-Feb-13,3,This version of Pandora is really different. The music stops playing after two songs because it wants to see if I'm still listening; and my favorite stations are hard to get to now. They should have left it the way it was.
Pandora,great,Alenda Christian,21-Oct-15,5,This app is as huge help when I'm cleaning
Pandora,Horrible Customer Service,Amy in CA,13-Aug-13,1,"Beware of using Pandora with a SmartTV, particularly if it's a Samsung.  There's a known bug that forces you to unplug your television in order to exit the App.  You should also know ahead of time that there's no telephone for Customer Service and that Customer Service available by E-Mail is neither expedient nor helpful.There are better music subscription choices."
Pandora,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!,bheidtman,22-Oct-12,4,"I really love this app. Its free entrrtainment. I can listen to it at my house whenever I want to. I only with they'd let you skip as many times as you want, but that's to be expected. I also wish you could take it where there is no wifi."

Pandora,There's nothing like Pandora,Kindle Customer,24-Jun-13,5,"I throughly enjoy being able to listen to the different genre of music, my favorite genre is Gospel, I can listen to the old music as well as the new music by various artists.  Pandora, Gotta have it!"
Pandora,Pandora Media is Great,Syracuse,29-Jun-14,5,Unlimited amount of music and all in categories.  Exceptional playing time.  Would recommend this for anyone that wants to enjoy music.
Pandora,Used to be the best.,apple,26-May-13,2,Now that you only have a forty hour time limit is aggravating. If you want to listen to more you have to pay. This used to be all free unless you wanted to remove apps. Not happy Pandora not happy at all.
Pandora,totally get,Dot,9-Oct-12,5,OMG this is an awesome app u can listen to music while draw or play another game in your...whatever u got but u have to pay attenton to it sometimes it will play excplicet stuff but it will warn u so pay attention to the music people!!!!!

Pandora,Excellent music alternative,Sam I Am,23-Jul-13,5,No commercials just music tailored to your own tastes. It also provides tracks that are similar to your own favorites. The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you don't rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening. A small price to pay.
Pandora,Five Stars,K Richmond,12-Aug-17,5,The best
Pandora,Four Stars,Biker Boy,8-Jan-16,4,love it better than XM

Pandora,Good app.,alexm86,21-Dec-12,4,"Pretty good app, works well on my device. I took one point off because it tends to play the same artist too often even when I add plenty of other artists to a station (with the artist in question being excluded from the list)."

Pandora,what happened?,Claire X,26-Jul-12,1,"Not sure which update screwed this up but nothing plays when i use the app. A few seconds of buffering and it moves on to the next song, buffers then next song. Ads take up at least 50% of my nexus s 4g screen."

Pandora,Radio is Dead... Long Live Pandora Radio,Andy G.,4-Nov-11,5,"Pandora radio is great. It really does a decent job of playing songs you like.

Pandora,What a Shame,K Family,27-Feb-12,2,"I used to enjoy this app because it gave me a variety of music from the designated artist, genre, or composer. Soon, it started playing music that wasn't even related to the station. It is quite disappointing on Pandora's account."
Pandora,It's OK but gets boring very quickly. Adds will drive you insane.,Everett Marabian,28-Dec-13,3,"If I choose an artist for the play list, you're lucky if you'll hear that band play at all or maybe one or two times in an hour. Seems to always be the same songs played most times. I guess that's what you get for the free Pandora. Lots of adds and commercials  Sometimes it's easier to just put my radio on and switch stations as I go along.  However, paid Pandora might be the alternative in order to see if it is still worth it or not."

The app I had (Apollo) stop working and of course, Black Berry doesn't have another.  No surprise, don't ask.  This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's).

Pandora,single artist,Torgerson,8-Aug-12,5,"to those complaining about it not playing enough of the artist you make the channel for, the riaa regulates them and only allow them to play a single artist 6 times with in a 3 hour period on a given ""channel""per user"

Pandora,3 out of 5,13 Faces,20-May-16,3,Awesome app BUT it's a battery hog! U can literally watch ur batt going
Pandora,awesome,Lydia,29-Apr-15,5,This is a cool music app you can make your own categories
Pandora,It's not as customizable as one might think...,Pamela T.,17-Nov-11,1,"For something that touts itself as internet radio, it's customization options are ridiculously limited. One might assume that, since it asks you to enter an artist's name to create your own personalized radio station, that you will be listening to that artist on said station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you've likely never heard of and that have nothing to do with the artist you entered. If it allowed you to enter artists you want to hear songs by and then actually played songs by those artists, and *only* those artists, I would no doubt give it a higher rank. The commercals and skip limits just make it all the worse. In short, if you are picky about your music, look elsewhere. This isn't going to give you many real options for customizing your personal ""station"".Signed, Pamela T."

Pandora,Awesome,Amazon Customer,20-Dec-11,5,This station is very easy to access and allows you to here a variety of different songs. One area I think this sight would benefit from. If people were allowed to pay to download by the song also select a specific song by an artist to listen too.

Pandora,"Pretty Good,  But a Few Problems",C. Doyle,16-May-12,4,"I like this app,  but I want to be able to skip more songs (because of some random artists) and sometimes I have an occasional freeze-up. I tried Slacker and Iheartradio, and Pandora won my opinion.  - Courtney D."
Pandora,Worst app!,Young Un,25-Dec-11,1,"This app is my least favorite app. It always sends me annoying emails, even though I deleted it months ago because of them. Also, it doesn't let you access many songs. I would give it 0 stars if possible."
Pandora,good app!,J. Pinto,12-Apr-12,4,"Good mixes, good variety for the most part. I would suggest a sleep timer to allow listening at night or for short periods.BTW: Hey, freeloaders, pay for it and you won't have to listen to commercials (wow, what a concept)."

Pandora,Hear you pre-set artists in Pandora,Rex Allen,2-Feb-14,5,"I love the software.  I have it loaded on my tablet, my Computer, my Laptop, My phone, My Blu-Ray player (Bedroom), My Smart TV (Living Room).

Pandora,great music for free,marvin,26-Jan-13,5,I would give pandora 10 stars. I have siriusxm and it doesn't compare. You can select the artiste or type of music and it will play so much better than listening to music you don't care for.
Pandora,Beware!,Joe P,26-Oct-12,4,Pandora is a cool app. Problem with current promotion is that it will auto renew each month unless you cancel it. Personally it's s not $3.99 a month ....good! Seems like a sneaky way to get subscribers.

Pandora,Best Radio,bla,6-Oct-12,5,You can listen to radio right on your device but u have to have WIFI so instead of buying a radio you can you can save money by downloading this free app and add stations and pick any music to listen to.
Pandora,rick James,keithp,13-Aug-14,5,old school street songs l used to like to listen to like the song Mary Jane it make me happy.
Pandora,Absolutely Amazing!!!,Lyndzey M,21-Mar-13,5,"I put in my favorite artist and it played ALL of the songs I love from other artists. Best music  app ever. Especially if you pay for the good version, totally worth 3.99 a month!"

Pandora,I love the unlimited songs and NO commercials on the premium ...,Lindy Horstman,7-Jun-17,5,I love the unlimited songs and NO commercials on the premium package-non stop music from any genre I feel like- it's wonderful!!!
Pandora,Its really good,J.Schmidt,1-May-13,5,it is awesome but I cant figure how to stop it from playing when I'm done.  its like a radio you don't really get to choose the song you want but yo get to choose a station
Pandora,needs some things from the iPhone/iTouch version,JWES,29-Mar-12,4,i love this app don't get me wrong. but it would be a lot better IMO if i can check my bookmarked music and delete them because you can NOT do it on this version of Pandora other then that its a great way to get into new music

Pandora,amazing for music lovers,Hunter,6-Dec-14,5,"Music lovers will love this app. Create your own stations, and the music that plays on the station's is related to that station. This is an amazing app if you don't want to listen to the normal radio.You can also skip songs, but you have a limit unless you upgrade. But I find switching the station's until I find the song I like,  quite easy."
Pandora,great,Gilbert Longoria,27-Jan-13,5,Pandora gives me the music I like without having buy and download hundreds of different songs. I had a satellite radio account for many years but find Pandora to be superior in content.

Pandora,it's ok,margaret allgood,8-Jun-13,3,"What I highly dislike is having to say ""still listening"". You would think that after paying for 1yr. subscription not only eliminating the commercial you would get at least 8-10 hrs of listening time instead of a couple hrs.  Really gets irritating to constantly having to do that. Also every once in awhile I can hear 2 stations playing at the same time so I have to shut down my device & restart."

I'd try to get it to go more toward my genre, but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I wasn't interested in.

(corny I know, but I'm tired and its catchy)",Adam Roulhac,9-Jan-15,5,Great app especially if you pay the extra 5 bucks a month for the plus edition. I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?

Pandora,Nothing but AWESOMNESS!!! :D,Anne Brennan,22-Jan-13,5,This is a great app. It. lets you listen to music for free and you can still hear that song again by liking it. You can hear your favorite artist's songs without hearing the same song three million times. This is a BIG must have app.
Pandora,Awesome,Coco,16-Apr-17,4,"I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that's really annoying when it's one of my favorites... otherwise it's Amazing!!"

Pandora,I HAVE TO PAY,verdramaca,10-Apr-13,1,So when I first downloaded the app I LOVED it.

Pandora,One Star,Kindle Customer,19-Jul-17,1,I could not download
Pandora,Pandora WAS great,Bethap916,18-Nov-12,1,Pandora was once a wonderful way to listen to music. Now between every couple of songs there's a huge pause. Not seconds long but minutes long. Then there's an ad. I don't mind ads but I do mind the minutes of silence. I get that they want you to upgrade and pay them but if the free version with ads is this poor then they should only offer the subscription.
Pandora,worthless,horror fan 13,8-Mar-13,1,"i want to like this app , but its worthless. i got it on my kindle fire and i play it put it in sleep mode it will play couple songs then stop. i unsleep my kindle and the app will be asking if im still listening."
Pandora,music spoiled by disgusting advertisement,Arctic Lynx,14-Dec-13,1,"I am shocked they would run ads for an oil company that dumped all that oil near Valdez, Alaska in 1989. How am I supposed enjoy music with their disgusting label looking right at me?  If that is a ploy to force us to sign up for the ad free version, they'd are sorely mistaken. I am now looking for a different source of music."
Pandora,NO,Madison Damann,7-Feb-12,1,I downloaded this for my kids that I babysit l. I added a. baby song for toddlers and I' m sexy and I know it can on!

Pandora,love pandora. hate this app.,franchell,18-Dec-11,1,terrible design.  it is entirely unclear how to add channels and work with the app besides simply playing a station. this is a case of less is less.
Pandora,"Love the App, even better if you pay the $36 a year",MathieKate,23-Nov-11,5,"I have had a subscription to Pandora for about 3 years.  Before it was so I could use it on my computer, but now that I have it on my phone I love it.  I have created a variety of stations, and enjoy the new music that comes up that I might not have thought of before.  If you don't like the song that comes on, just vote it down and it won't play again.Those complaining about the ads, there is a simple fix - buy the subscription.  It is only $36 a year, well worth it."
Pandora,Its Changing,Ebi,28-Mar-13,1,this thing is changing and not for the better. its not gonna be free anymore. 3.99 a month? aint nobody go time for that.
Pandora,Better than Jango,SmartGirl,17-Dec-12,5,Way better. Jango took too long to load and only gave u five skips an hour! This is superior to every other music app out there!
Pandora,kindle fire,Cheska S.,17-Jun-12,1,doesn't work at all and its really slow and asks u for all this facebook stuff. DONT GET THIS APP
Pandora,Love Pandora,Amazon Customer,14-Feb-13,5,. If you're use to Pandora you will love this app. Pandora will let you hear music and create stations. I am a Pandora user and this app works fine.

Pandora,stupid,cheer 4 life,25-Sep-12,1,at first I liked this app but then my sister recommend JANGO. it has great songs and you can skip it as many times as you like.  -kiley
Pandora,GETTING WORSE,Tom Dickens,24-Sep-12,1,"Used to be good, but has evolved to play too many ads, ads are too loud, ads take up most of the screen.  Would buy an ad-less app, but they don't sell one; they sell a monthly ad-less subscription. LAME!"
Pandora,Free radio that you program dynamically!,Mark K. Sheets,15-Nov-11,5,How could anything free be any better? I believe this is worth paying for if the adds bother you. You will find similar music to what you select and may find artists you were not aware of.
Pandora,MY NEW BFF,Angel,17-Apr-13,5,this is the best music app ive ever used and I love it!!! when I'm home and bored I am always using it! :)
Pandora,Find another app than this one.,Daniel J. Carter,17-Oct-11,2,"Tracks basically everything on your phone, from phone calls, txts to gps location and more.

Pandora,Waste of my time,Lynn Williams,4-Jun-17,1,"Couldn't even sign up. ""Sorry, not excepting sign ups right now"". Then why do you bother being available to people who DON'T know that...common sense.I tried several times but nothing happened."

Pandora,Not so good,viv,2-Jul-12,3,I am not too thrilled with this app. I'm constantly getting error messages on my Kindle. I try to download songs and errors keep popping up.
Pandora,wrong,x man,8-Apr-12,1,there is one one huge problem with this app and other than that I love it.it never plays the right song
Pandora,"1.7.1 Poor audio quality, lack of privacy",Richard Collette,28-Sep-12,1,"Either the upgrade to 1.7.1 or some change on the hosting side caused the audio to lose all the highs.  I thought my tweeters were busted at first but no, every other audio application sounds fine.  The music barely sounds like it's in stereo any longer.  And why would a music player need to read my phone state (which includes the phone numbers of who is calling).  Pandora is going the way of Netflix, losing customers by dropping service quality."
Pandora,Does not work,Fernando Rubio Flores,22-Dec-11,1,"This apps does not work, at all. Just a blue screen :(. It is impossible to get pass the starting screen.  Thus, impossible to say any thing else."

Pandora,Doesn't work on my Fire,Charles Magurean,25-Jan-17,1,On startup just shows a failed connection error
Pandora,"no, you may not email my mom",BeccaGee,19-Sep-12,1,"...and I can't imagine why anyone would let you. these permissions are insane. I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."
Pandora,beyonce,shante marable,1-Jan-12,5,like beyonce cause she.is a great singer and she where nice close and she having.Baby I. remember that when she was young she became destiny child three girls but.two left then they found a.new two girls.one. left so now.it was two when they was.doing.there on.thang they.came.back. so now there no.more destiny child.
Pandora,"Pandora brings intelligent radio to you, wherever you are.",Sean Mcclain,15-Jan-12,5,I love being able to thumb down songs on the stations I listen to & then never have to listen to those songs ever again on my radio.

Downing,21-Nov-12,1,You can listen to 2 songs and the it just stops! It is so annoying because this is a really good music station and i thought i would have a good music station. I'm very disappointed! :(

Pandora,ariana grande,adrianna grande,12-Jan-12,1,this is sad I live in in Tijuana and can not use because it cant be used in this countryÂ¡!!!!!!!
Pandora,Its ok,Joan,17-Jul-17,3,"It always says that I can't find a connection so I have to press retry like 5 times before it actually works, then its really laggy. And every time I try to have it in the background so I can hear music while using another app it quits working. Overall as much as I like Pandora I'll just stick with Spotify it doesn't have any of these issues"
Pandora,"cool,awesome,neat",Amazon Customer,25-Mar-16,5,This is A-W-E-S-O-M-E. You can make your own music stations and they are unlimited. And you can Like and unlike. And you don't have to get more and more updates.

Pandora,I am would give it nine stars,John,17-Oct-11,5,"I would give this nine stars, just like the nine nine nine plan. The 999 plan replaces the tax code with the simple but effective 999 plan. Pandora is great because it shows you new artists like the ones you love"
Pandora,Great,Nathan,6-Jan-13,5,The music that the kids listen to these days can be used through this app but I would also like to use it one day.
Pandora,music,Richard St Pierre,8-Apr-13,4,love to listen to music especially when I'm working and you can pick whatever kind of music you like to listen to
Pandora,THIS app pissed me off!!,A great app to UNinstall,9-Jan-12,1,I would choose a song and it would go to a different fricken band then I went the unistall Icon
Pandora,A-,Abbie 50,26-Dec-16,1,Pandora you made playing songs to complicated! I can't play sucker for pain! It just keeps playing other songs (pls add a search button) The A- Will turn to a A plus if you add a play song button
Pandora,kindles interference with ability of tablet,disappoint ed,1-Feb-12,1,This tablet is being changed to block my ability to access websites I prefer. I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone.
Pandora,Glitchy and out dated on kindle fire hdx,danny,28-Aug-17,3,Would give 5 stars but the app is super out dated on kindle fire HDX and super glitchy. Please fix
Pandora,Five Stars,Mickaline Pagels,8-Nov-16,5,Love pandora
Pandora,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,25-Mar-16,5,Works great I get all the music that I like
Pandora,"Great app, but...",Pat Cooper,10-Apr-16,3,"It exits the app after I listen to it for 30 to 45 minutes, I have to reopen and can't continue listening to the song that was playing before! If you fix this then I will gladly give a five star rating!"
Pandora,fix or ill rate one star,Serena F.,7-Oct-17,2,The reason I gave 2 stars is because whenever I type a song name or the artist I don't get the song or artist I want so plz fix it only works on my phone I'm on tablet
Pandora,Numero uno!,Chris Niederhaus,10-Jun-17,5,"Use pandora every day. For driving to work, relaxing at home, partiea. Any day, every day, any time. Great app, wide selection!"
Pandora,other radio apps better,alistairville,1-Dec-11,2,"Navigation quirky. Ads all-pervasive. Sound quality mediocre. Maybe good if you're already a Pandora fan. Otherwise, skip it. Uninstalling from my Kindle fire."
Pandora,Crashes with the October 12 2017 update,Danie,30-Oct-17,1,I have had Pandora for years never had an issue but ever since the October 12 2017 update all my Pandora does is crash on me after one song!!!! This is very frustrating
Pandora,too unstable,Amazon Customer,27-Nov-12,1,The ad supported Kindle version just does not work reliably.  Music stops and I hear nothing but am told that an ad is playing.  And music does not return.  Not much good in this form.
Pandora,Gone downhill,Whitney Liberty,15-Nov-11,1,"I used to be a devoted Pandora user, but the app has been on a steady decline. Like other users, I have been having issues hearing complete songs. I've reported the issue and haven't seen any sign of a fix. While the occasional crash was okay, this consistent problem is SO frustrating. So I'm gonna check out Slacker. Sorry Pandora, but your poor response to big problems has lost you another user."
Pandora,Can't even sign in!,Christina,22-Jul-16,1,When I enter a email it says its incorrect and I don't think a zip code should be used to login I wish I could rate it 0 stars I can't even sign in
Pandora,downhill,maris,30-Nov-12,1,"With the new update, almost every other song it just stops playing music. Sometimes I have to switch stations in order to continue listening to music. It is extremely annoying."
Pandora,NOT for kindle fire,abel,29-Dec-11,1,"when first started using it, it was good, but the second time it was having problems. When I tried to open it I would just get stuck on the blue Pandora screen, so I reinstalled it only to get another problem. It wouldn't let me find a new station so I only had the first station I looked for,the ice cube station. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with the kindle fire."
Pandora,No.,M M A A X X,9-Feb-16,1,"I bought Pandora One on my phone.. an HTC One M7, and it will not transfer. I am on a first generation KINDLE Fire."
Pandora,sucks,j.wearden,14-Jan-12,1,suckssuckssuckssucks@@@_@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@poor oozy ooooooo9 /oozy oozy poor ooiioiopoiipp
Pandora,It kind of works,tim12,14-Dec-16,2,It randomly cuts on in the middle of the night  some times when you unlock my device
Pandora,AWESOME MUSICAL APP REQUIRED BY ANOTHER ONE,jordain,25-Nov-16,5,It's compared  to Spotify
Pandora,Waste of time,CHERI ROSS,1-Jun-16,1,"After downloading, app requires registration & then requires year of birth and zip code, supposedly 2provide""customized service"", however, after providing the info, a msg appeared stating my registration was not accepted, period! Not""pls try again later"", or""there was a problem...."", just denied&no uninstall option!"

Pandora,To many ads,Awesome Player Person,18-Dec-16,2,There are a 2 ads about every 3 songs.
Pandora,Needs a couple features from Slacker,Hey Hey Trojan,26-Oct-11,4,"I like Pandora more than Slacker, but Pandora has no ""never play this artist"" feature. So when Brittany Spears comes on, I have to thumbs down her one song versus her entire career."
Pandora,not fun,Colin Freeman,20-Mar-16,1,Every password u type won't work on kindle fire!
Pandora,Very upset!,Mom24gr8boys,24-Feb-17,1,I have paid for Pandora for years. The app will no longer open on my Kindle or my fire stick! Very upset. What's up with that?
Pandora,Not That Great._Ÿ˜’_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜µ_Ÿ˜¨,JR,8-Apr-16,2,"It kind of stinks._Ÿ˜‘ I mean I want to be able to pick my songs! _Ÿ˜ Since I can't do that, I'm rating it lower. _Ÿ˜’If the people who made this want me to rate higher, then they should make it possible to pick what you want to listen to._Ÿ˜ª_Ÿ™…  _Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜_"
Pandora,Best app ever,Kevin E Frank,9-Oct-17,5,IT PLAYS BTS ANIME MUSIC AND JUST MUSIC AND RIGHT NOW ITS PLAY BEST OF ME FROM BTS AND BEFORE IT PLAY A OTHER SONG FROM BTS AND I LOVE PANADO
Pandora,"Never completes a song, force closes.",Amazon Customer,19-Nov-11,1,Only plays few seconds of song before skipping to the next. Force closes a lot. Plays a complete commercial every two songs. Since it never completes a song it's all commercial. Deleted (Same problem on non-Amazon version) Droid2Global
Pandora,great!!,jdhdhdjdh,4-May-16,5,Awesome app
Pandora,blue lives matter too,Amazon Customer,11-Jul-16,1,#black lives matter uninstall
