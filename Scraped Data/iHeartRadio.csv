iHeartRadio,Amazing !,susieq,3-Jul-16,5,I love this I heart radio app. Have been listening to it every day . The variety is perfect for a change of pace from standard radio stations. I can fit the music to the activity I want any given day. Love it ! :)
iHeartRadio,Good but Frequently Malfunctions,Thrisha Nesbitt,11-Apr-14,3,"This is a good app.... when it works. I have reinstalled this app several times but it continues to freeze, refuses to start, and takes long periods of time to buffer. I have tried not signing in, signing in using email and tying this app to my Facebook but it has the same glitches accross the board. Its a decent app for free, but if you have some free cash I would advise looking for a better music app."
iHeartRadio,music to my ears,J. Carver,12-Nov-17,4,good radio
iHeartRadio,weird mix sometimes,didisparkles,21-Sep-13,4,Love the commercial free app. Sometimes there is a 30 second ad at the beginning then that's it for hours. I don't like that you can only skip so many times a day because sometimes there is some really horrid stuff.
iHeartRadio,"I go walking at the ""Y"" about 4 times a ...",Kaye Vaughn-Bentley,27-Jul-17,5,"I go walking at the ""Y"" about 4 times a week, and the music makes it so much more enjoyable!"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,2BNLove,2-Nov-17,5,Love
iHeartRadio,Love this app,Shealaun Neilson,7-Nov-16,5,Love this app! So much better than Pandora!  I love that I can listen to my favorite radio host since she know longer is broadcast in Utah. Thank you and love Delilah!
iHeartRadio,love it,Forgiven,5-Jun-15,4,"Pick stations, artists or songs and hit play it's that easy. Plus it remembers what u like and plays similar stuff!!"
iHeartRadio,Great App,Skyler,27-Oct-15,5,"Excellent app! Works well, and streams well even in the background with other apps running. Love the customization that it offers. The app learns what music u actually like through your ratings. So rate what you like, and the stations will cater well to you."
iHeartRadio,would be great,I. OLeary,30-Apr-13,4,i loved this app at first especially after switching from pandora to this it seemed to have all the same functions plus you could stream internet stations as well but after a while i noticed some songs are censored. there is a setting for explicit content but it just keeps you from using custom stations other than that its a pretty great replacement for pandora and its FREE WITH NO LIMITS!!! ALSO YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK.i dont have it and i have saved custom stations
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Ralph,24-Jul-17,4,Great Radio app. Just wish I could get local ball games.
iHeartRadio,may work for others,Bill,1-Aug-15,2,just not for me
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Michael DiDonato,7-Jan-17,5,love it
iHeartRadio,Not impressed.,terrbearr,14-Mar-15,3,"Not a real big fan of this app.  If I want commercials I can listen to the radio in my car. The way everyone talked about it, I had to try it. Maybe I just haven't found the right radio station(s)"
iHeartRadio,Nice option,Tom,2-Dec-15,5,"Work's well! Good variety of stations, and styles of music. I can turn on whatever kind of programming that I'm in the mood for and not have to listen to whatever automated crap that the record labels and station owners decide is popular!"
iHeartRadio,I love this app cause I have a apple phone an ...,malane,29-Aug-16,3,I love this app cause I have a apple phone an they make you buy all there music so I just click on I heart radio an do my garden work are take a walk an listen to the music
iHeartRadio,radio worth listening to,Sam Crawford,21-Jan-13,5,"What makes iHeart Radio worth while is that you can listen to regular radio stations, or you can creat your own station. I find myself listening to stations in other parts of the USA.  Creating your own personal station is what I like best about this app. so many stations only play what they are dictated to play, it is nice to listen to stations where the music is understandable. If you like music, and are not happy with the local stations, this is the app for you."
iHeartRadio,Good when it works!!!,Pam Schott,3-Jan-14,2,"I think that the application was great at first but then it started freezing.When ever I go on it and try to change the music,it says that it is not responding and to wait or close it! I love the app but it is not not behaving.I have tried downloading the app many times but it still won't work on my kindle fire.It is making me very frustrated.If you want to listen to music,DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!"
iHeartRadio,Bugged alarm?,Ian L.,22-Apr-15,4,Easily my most used app. Great selection with variety when I need it. Only problem I run into is the alarm that rarely works. Bringing up a message that it failed to go off because the app was not running when it clearly was. Leading me to use a fail-safe so I make it to my appointments.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,3KL,25-Nov-15,5,GET MY KSFO NEARLY ANY WHERE
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio free music app review,spammy0124,13-Dec-16,5,"This is a great app, especially on the stereo FireHD 8"" tablet. Setup your channels and let it go. Hear what you want at any time you want."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio Review,MSquat,19-Mar-13,5,"After hearing countless radio stations saying that they are part of iHeartRadio, I figured I'd download the app to my Kindle Fire HD and see what it's all about.  I have to tell you, I was very surprised at the amount of stations associated with the network and the quality of the audio.  I'm going to purchase a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker and now I can stream radio stations to it as well because of the app.  And, it was free, so how can you go wrong?"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Jessica T.,20-Jun-15,5,love it
iHeartRadio,Love the variety of musical genres and radio stations,Jason Henry Attaway,10-Aug-17,5,Love the variety of musical genres and radio stations!!  Radio stations come in very loud and clear!!  I absolutely love it!!!
iHeartRadio,One of my daily use apps!,Mike,3-Dec-13,5,I use this app on a daily basis for radio at home.  I live in an area that has poor radio reception on all radios in my home.  No problems in my vehicles but reception sucks in the house.  This app allows me to have a huge variety of stations from the internet via Wi-Fi.  The clarity of the music stream is awesome and it is highly customizable with favorites. I really like this app and recommend it
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,25-Jul-17,5,Ticket 760. The Mike Taylor Show. The Grind. Fox Sports.
iHeartRadio,Great music choices!,P. Belfy,27-Jul-14,5,I love a very broad spectrum of music. This app does a great job of anticipating music I will like based on music I have requested or liked. The is a fine tune option for more familiar or less. Also the opportunity to find terrestrial radio stations. Nice mix. My go-to for music and talk for my every mood.Mountain Goat are the best!
iHeartRadio,Music Lover,RonP,12-Apr-13,5,This is the best station in the music business. If you want variety and love all kind of music this is for you. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
iHeartRadio,it is easy to use and too associate by genre or artist,Ronald Nelson,27-Feb-16,5,Absolutely free... this program provides access to thousands of US radio stations... it is easy to use and too associate by genre or artist.  You can't go wrong with loading this fine App to your mobile device.
iHeartRadio,One Star,Honesty,15-Oct-14,1,"I am not tech savvy, It was very confusing....I deleted it.."
iHeartRadio,Love it! love it!,chatcat65,9-Jan-14,5,App is fabulous letting you access with or without Facebook or email just like it says. Easy to use and navigate through setting up your own stations or selecting ones nationwide and easily located.  I set up my own stations based on my likes/dislikes especially because I'm super picky and like radically different channels depending on the mood at the moment. Thanks for the great freebie!
iHeartRadio,Listen to you own music choices!,J. Harris,2-Jan-14,5,Easy to choose your type of music and to enjoy the lovely melodies any time of day or night.  Have this on my phone as well.
iHeartRadio,best ever,Gage Strawcutter,1-Mar-15,5,"I love this app because I can always listen to country music and not have to type the name of the song I want to listen to like youtube.com's music  and youtube.com's music  STINKS if I rated youtube.com's music I would give it a negative 300,000,000Iheartradio_Ÿ˜ÅYouTube music_Ÿ’©"
iHeartRadio,you need this,Kindle Customer,10-Jun-15,5,Must have
iHeartRadio,I HEART RADIO APP.,rochelle tillman,1-Aug-14,5,"I REALLY LOVE THIS APP.  I CAN CUSTOMIZE MY MUSIC STATIONS 2 FIT MY TASTE OF WHAT I WANT 2 LISTEN 2 .  I HAVE THE APP ON MY KINDLE FIRE,  MY PHONE & MY LAPTOP.  IT'S GREAT 2 HAVE THIS MUSIC ON THE GO,  & 2 NOT WORRY ABOUT LOSING THE FREQUENCY OR GET STATIC LIKE YOU WOULD ON YOUR REGULAR RADIO.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ~ 5 *'S..."
iHeartRadio,Generally good music,luvinthislife,30-May-15,4,"I enjoy the app, but just wish it contained more episodes of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 countdown. Also, some of the ""classics"" stations (pop, country, rock, soul, etc.) don't actually contain music from the genre they are supposed to, which can be an annoyance."
iHeartRadio,Good Shit,KuShNuGsS611,21-Sep-13,5,"A good radio player no doubt! Especially for those times when you get out of your car when ur favorite song was on and u wanna keep listening to it but got no radio handy, you just click ur station on here and the same song will be playing everytime! You can also create your own personal stations, and use any station for an alarm clock music wake up, and more... Overall Good App!! And best of all its FREEE!!!"
iHeartRadio,No way to stop the music,Walter J Bermudez,5-Dec-12,2,"This is a good App,but I have two mayor complaints:first,I selected some type of music and selected one broadcasting of the same one,and it never sound.It looks like non existent,so this is something very annoing;second,once you are done hearing the music there is no way to turn off the site,you have to turn off the ,in my case,the kindle Fire.Also,wrong.Usually I try to hear music at the same time I am reading,so I have to turno off the whole sistem,not just the App."
iHeartRadio,update and inappropriate.,Fernandez,24-Feb-15,3,I don't really like the app because it has some inappropriate pictures of some singers.Also when I had  full Internet connection it would not turn on.I like the app because it has alot of my favorite songs.But when I press a song I want to play it just picks different song.So I rate it 3 stars.
iHeartRadio,Can listen to my favorite morning show,Renee,7-Nov-14,4,"I started using the iHeartRadio app when I could not listen to the radio at my new job. I loved being able to listen to the radio without interference. The only problem I have had is that at least once a month, I cannot hear the radio from my favorite station because it will not connect. Otherwise, this app is great!"
iHeartRadio,Probably the best radio app...,Thomas from NC,12-Jun-14,5,"Great variety of live stations, music of every description as well as news/talk and sports! A large library of artists and their catalogs as well for customized stations, made from song titles or the artist's/group's nam. Even has stations for activities like studying, working out, or relaxing. It also has stations for the different decades of music."
iHeartRadio,AMAZING!,Maryellen E,19-Mar-15,5,"I used to use this app all the time. My brother constantly insisted on me switching to Pandora, but I loved listening to the radio anywhere. I recently moved, and I LOVE that I can still listen to my favorite morning talk shows! This app lets me listen to whatever I want, whenever I want!"
iHeartRadio,great music,NEAL WEGING,2-Aug-14,5,they create the music you love. I like that you can rate if you like a song or not like a song
iHeartRadio,NOTE II,Ralph,10-Mar-14,5,"This is a fantastic App. It's smooth. It offers great mixes of your Genre or specific Artists. It also offers local radio Stations in your area as well. If you purchase the Premium Version, it will allow you to record the songs you like as well. I don't ever recommend anything I don't or wouldn't use. I don't believe you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this one."
iHeartRadio,I love I Heart Radio,Rose Duran,3-Jan-17,5,"I love I Heart Radio, can hear all my favorite music, don't use the radio that much why when I have I heart Radio, Thanks I Heart Radio"
iHeartRadio,eh... it's OK,Johnny in Texas,14-Dec-15,3,It's clear channel... just be aware those people have an agenda.  BUT you get about the same quality as any radio station except you get to choose the format (although not the content...  like I said ... CCC has an agenda).
iHeartRadio,I AM IN LOVE,Lori Wise Scheirer,4-Aug-13,5,"I have been listening since they were available.  You pick a genre and hear stations across the country!Or, look up a specific artist and make your own stations with that artists music and other artists in the same genre.The best part is you can any artist you can think of.I AM HOOKED!!!!THANK U IHEARTRADIO, I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡"
iHeartRadio,Great!,C. Ligh,23-Dec-12,5,"This is a great app.  I put it on my kindle fire and was able to put in my zip code and find my local stations.  I was also able to put in the local station that is playing just Christmas songs.  Then, the grandchildren were able to hit ""scan"" and go through all the stations just playing holiday songs.  By myself, I just put my favorite local station in while I was cleaning the house.  Another cleaning day today.  Looking forward to listen to the radio!"
iHeartRadio,Two Stars,Mary Jane Igrec,21-Jun-17,2,I was hoping to here Cleveland Indians games but they are not on. Must go back to my radio.
iHeartRadio,best music app EVER!!!!,Julie,16-May-12,5,this app is AMAZING!!!!!! the best radio app EVER! I love it and the fact that its free makes it all the better. all of my friends have Pandora and it has TONS of adds and it gets sooo annoying so when I downloaded this app I was hopeful that it wouldn't have this problem; and it didn't! this app works amazing on my kindleFire and not only do you get to listen to any radio station you can make your own station with your favorite singer or band. if you love to listen to music I would recommend this app.
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Jtg,27-Jun-15,4,its okay

iHeartRadio,I would recommend,Kimberly,18-Jul-15,5,"This my favorite music radio station whether I'm at work, on my daily commute, or just relaxing at home. I have been using it for years and will continue. It's had been glitch free. My favorite option is building my own stations. I would definitely recommend"
iHeartRadio,terrific app,Kindle Customer,26-Dec-13,5,Listening to songs that I have not heard in years.  Like this app a lot.  Will be listening to this a lot
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Marche Michael,19-May-17,5,Love it!!!!!!
iHeartRadio,Awesome and Recommended,Kindle Customer,24-Mar-16,5,"I really to ""love"" this media outlet as I listen to it while I work, both on my computer and on the Kindle. Just like having an FM station, only better. Keep us the great work, iHeartRadio!"
iHeartRadio,I suppose,Yoshiyah Burrell,28-May-15,2,But I prefer to just listen to music files locally as I don't like listening to hit music. I use it for streaming news and sports on the go though. iHeartRadio app also doesn't offer every station available in your area. Just the ones that are licensed by ClearChannel.
iHeartRadio,I heart radio app,mimismom223,8-Mar-15,5,this is the best app ever I can listen to anyhing I want live and create a playlist I heard iggy demi lavoto pop rap country rock I love this so much thank you the creaters of I heart radio its the best thank you for making something that will suit everyone LOVE YOU I HEART RADIO!!!!!!!!
iHeartRadio,"love it so look much,",Amazon Customer,27-Jul-15,5,It is a great app with many stations and I always use it on my 2mile walk a day....it is great you don't half to spend money and moments on downloading songs when you can download the FREE... I heart radio app is the best thing that has ever been created
iHeartRadio,Won't connect with Facebook,Darrin Bond,9-May-12,2,"It's funny how the Amazon version of this app won' t connect using Facebook, but the Google Play version will.This isn't the first time I've seen differences in the offerings of the two app stores. Unfortunately, it tends to be Amazon that falls short of the mark. For those of you with Kindle Fire that might be interested in Google Play apps, I would suggest finding out how to ""sideload"" the apps. It's not difficult, and it gives you another - and sometimes better - app source."
iHeartRadio,loveee,brother,30-Jun-14,5,I love this app because I can listen to all my favorite songs. I am a DIRECTIONER. So I can listen to ONE DIRECTION when I want. U can also listen to other people to tho. Another awesome thing about this app is that u can listen to the radio. Like kiss FM. So get this app. It is truly and awesome app.I love ONE DIRECTION SO MUCH
iHeartRadio,"Songza, Pandora, and live radio all in one!!",David,21-Jun-13,5,"This app is like all major radio apps in one, and that's why i love it! Its kind of like Songza with the Perfect For feature. If its Friday afternoon, click perfect for and it will give you things like working, napping, etc. Click one and start listening. Its also like pandora in which you type in an artist or song, and itll give you similar ones. and of course, it has the live radio stations its known for. Get this app."
iHeartRadio,NOT IMPRESSED,Tina Marie Bailey,18-Aug-15,2,"I do not care for I heart for my phone.  Difficult to find what type of music I want to listen ((such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, 80's music just to name a few)) or the selection available is too limited.  I would NOT recommend this product."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amadeo Molinos,4-May-17,5,Best app ever. Use it all the time.
iHeartRadio,LOVE IT!,Mishayla Carroll,23-Oct-14,5,It's so awesome to be able to listen to ANY station in the world! For free!
iHeartRadio,cool,Anjelica V.,22-Jan-14,5,"nice variety of music, simple to use and seems to always channel songs that I like. No complaints here =]"
iHeartRadio,great app!!,Jaydlyn Frank,10-Jul-14,5,"I love this app honestly. It's a great alarm. And sleep timer. Also the music is amazing. I'm in a different state, and now I can listen to my music from back home. But I think they should add a extra thing to where we can make a playlist of songs and be able to go to that sometimes. But I hope you take this to heart. Rate five for sure."
iHeartRadio,Best radio app!,DIGItal Don,2-Jan-17,5,Hands down my favorite radio app! Very easy to create custom station. Also integrates very nicely with Amazon music for purchases.
iHeartRadio,I like listening to I heart radio,Steve Howard,25-Sep-15,5,"I'm a custodian at an elementary school. I use a vacuum cleaner about three-three and a half hours each evening. I like listening to I heart radio. I put in my ear buds and start vacuuming and before I know it, it is time to get off work."
iHeartRadio,"Core engine works great, finding/tuning stations not so great",Michael S. Pukish,30-Jan-14,3,"The core engine works great, never skips, even with relatively low bandwidth connections.  However, I hate that it forces you to link to facebook or twitter just to bookmark stations as favorite.  I have no need to tell all of my social media what I'm listening to.  Then, the system that's left to merely search a station is clunky, inefficient (huge icons per screen), etc."
iHeartRadio,Three Stars,Bran di    POsey,12-Jul-15,3,Good
iHeartRadio,Great For Music Lovers,Ted Harden,29-Oct-15,4,Anyone who likes music will like this app. Lots of similarities with other apps of this type but without the pesky ads. Song choices for genres are pretty spot-on. All in all I really like this one and use it more than any other.
iHeartRadio,Music to my ears,jazzy wazzy,23-Jan-16,5,I love music and maybe you would for the holidays HAPPY VALENTINES Day hope you enjoy it is always an honor helping people  and maybe my comments would help you out see you later_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ’__Ÿ’—_Ÿ’—_Ÿ’—_Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–
iHeartRadio,Great way to listen to music,Deb S,22-Sep-13,4,"Have seen commercials on TV for iHeartRadio and wanted to see what it was about...don't have it locally. This app gave me the chance to check it out. You can select the type of music you want to listen to, and locations for your stations. I just wish some of them were closer to where I live.Pros: great music choices to your likingCons: may not be a station near you.Highly recommend"
iHeartRadio,I will always enjoy old school music,Karen L.Clarke,29-Feb-16,5,"I will always enjoy old school music. I like making my radio station. But what I like the most is, I  can read the words of my favorite  songs  I Heart please keep up the good work.  Thank you."
iHeartRadio,i use this every day. if you pick a ...,David H,19-Dec-16,5,i use this every day. if you pick a groop it will kick out on my phone at times but if i pick a radio station it never kicks out.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,redrumsport,17-Jun-15,5,is kool app
iHeartRadio,worked great,Mal Nushi,6-Jul-13,5,no radio lag or anything. works great on every device i used it in. i found that it did not have the halo radio channel
iHeartRadio,Its nice!!,James Burcham,12-Oct-14,5,"I love this app. I would probably die without my music. And don't listen to the people who say it don't work without Facebook. You can still use it you just can't get custom stations. And if you are really desperate for some custom stations, just go to email and make a fake one. It will let you get custom stations."
iHeartRadio,_Ÿ_¶MUSIC_Ÿ_¶,Shukumei,10-May-15,5,"If you love music this is for you. Top artist from Ariana to Wizfliffia. The only thing I hate is that if you don't have an account for it you can't listen to stations that have all Taylor swift. However, you can still listen to music even if you don't have an account."
iHeartRadio,I Heart IHeartRadio!,Abby,6-Aug-12,4,"I normally don't write reviews but I decided,  why not? Personally, I love the app! It is great to hear songs from some of my favorite radio stations and even find new artists. I have found two new radio stations because of this app. It is easy to use, free and works great on my Kindle Fire (in which, I use it every day). The only thing is I wish it had the ""last songs listened to"" feature like the website has. Other than that I think the app is all around great for what it does."
iHeartRadio,Seamless and accurate,rod clark,25-Feb-14,4,"I love this app. Iheart is perhaps not as diverse as others, but i don't care. Too many people think they need to be bleeding edge music hipsters; sometimes i just wanna hear Justin, Imagine Dragons and Jay-Z. You don't need, to hide, people. Be happily lazy, let a sophisticated algorithm(misspelled?) pick your music. If you don't like the pick, skip it! FREEDOM!!!"
iHeartRadio,The best entertainment.,Jgaski3,29-Mar-16,5,Thousands of stations to choose from and a perfect way to kill time through out the work day. I installed this on my blackberry z30 and it worked perfectly and provided hours of entertainment
iHeartRadio,I like the iHeartRadio app.,Amazon Customer,22-Apr-16,5,Free streaming radio broadcasts.  Both cool and easy to use.
iHeartRadio,Minimally useful.,Kindle Customer,29-Jul-16,1,"It makes ""recommendations"" that have NOTHING to do with my likes,and then assigns some of those as ""favorites"" without letting me get rid of them."
iHeartRadio,get this app,hannah,5-Jun-15,5,This app is so amazing. You can listen to pretty much every song. This app is free and the music is free. You can also listen to the song while you play games or when on pinterest. Which is amazing but I highly recommend this to everyone if you want a music app.
iHeartRadio,"Best Radio for me.  "" MY,  I HEART RADIO""",Jaye-Bridget Bergeron,19-Feb-16,5,I love  I HEART Radio I can play my stations I want to listen too. I'm just really hard on the earphones I go through one set a month as I always pull the wire out. But I get my stations just for me..
iHeartRadio,Love listening to my favorite talk shows at night,Cindy,26-May-16,5,"Love listening to my favorite talk shows at night, or even previous shows whenever I want....  Also, love having my favorite music while on the treadmill to help me through it !"
iHeartRadio,Love it!!!!,Dennis Fasig,11-May-13,5,"I've been away from Dallas for years and really missed listening to my morning sports talk station kick the ticket. When I found this app, I was shocked to see the ticket on there. Now I listen to it every morning and even got some of my friends hooked on it."
iHeartRadio,"Love, Love, Love this App",Anna J. Warrington,27-Feb-15,5,"This is the best music app.  I have picked so many favorite stations, artists, and songs.  Sometimes you just want to hear a certain artist and you can listen to the songs from that artist.  Thanks for such a pleasant listening experience.  If you love music, this is the app for you."
iHeartRadio,Best telephone radio ap so far.,Chrisbuyer,8-May-16,5,"I heart iHeartRadio. On a recent trip across country, where the Tunin app would skip and drop out, iHeartRadio played cleanly through with no drops and no problems finding stations."
iHeartRadio,Love listening to iHeartRadio,Amazon Customer,3-Jan-17,5,"Love listening to iHeartRadio, love the fact that I can go to sleep to it at night, I can set the timer and drift off to sleep."
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Yvonne T. Mercado,9-Jul-17,4,Best application it's made my music experiences fantastic
iHeartRadio,iHeart User Not Ideal,Ziplocket,28-Jan-17,4,"I do not use this feature. It is difficult to depend on. Most technical minded people will be better than I am at this, I am sure."
iHeartRadio,Great App,Jones,11-May-15,5,"FUN,FUN FUN. All the latest songs and oldie goodies. If you can't find music to your taste in iHeart, you're just not looking hard enough. My go-to music app. Forgot about that app with an ancient Greek gal's name who had a box full of nasty things. iHeart rocks!!!!"
iHeartRadio,All it does is crash,Ball P. Penn,2-Mar-16,3,"3 stars. Not because I can review it, but because all it does is crash. Since i won't dump on an app if i can't use it, and I won't go overboard about one that won't run I pick the middle ground."
iHeartRadio,"Decent offering but limited in my area, Michigan.",John Lovell,28-May-14,2,"I was looking for an FM radio app so I could stream radio through my phone and this was highly recommended so I gave it a try. What I found was an app that allows streaming, but only through a limited amount of stations (5). This may be due to my area or it may not. Good news is it's free so give it a shot and see if it works better for you."
iHeartRadio,Too many commerials. Is there a commercial free version ...,Joseph M Brotzge,25-Jun-17,1,Too many commerials.  Is there a commercial  free version  available?
iHeartRadio,"Love, Love, Love iHeartRadio",elj,11-Jan-13,5,"Found IHeart Radio for my home computer a long time ago & just downloaded for my Kindle Fire.  Just the thing for background music while surfing on the Kindle and for working in the kitchen (which is where my PC is).  I used to use Pandora but that only plays for 4 hrs and then you have to ""re-up"".  iHeartRadio will play on and on for FREE w/o interruption and hardly any commercials!!  Like I said:  ""Love, Love, Love iHeartRadio"""
iHeartRadio,Iheart iheartradio!,Cheryl,23-Jan-16,4,"The thing I like most about I heart radio is I can simply type in what I want to hear and it is there quickly. I like that I can go back to the oldies, play the latest and most popular, or just mix it up."
iHeartRadio,Great Radio Station,Amazon Customer,22-Sep-16,5,"You can choose songs you like fairly quickly, and it's all for free."
iHeartRadio,Easy to Use But Limited,Big Sis,16-Jun-14,3,"I had heard iHeartRadio promoted for some time (probably mostly on our local Clear Channel radio station).  It is easy to use.  I have been somewhat disappointed at the choice of stations that are available to stream through it.  However, it may be possible to pick some stations you want individually, just by hunting them up on the Web."
iHeartRadio,Awesome!,iris,3-Sep-17,5,So glad that I have this App on my kindle.

iHeartRadio,darn it!,zipzapannemc,18-Jul-15,1,"Darn it! I got this app and I was so excited, but then I tried to make an account and it said that I wasn't authorized to make an account, and it wouldn't even let me try again! Now I hate this app. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Thumbs down!_Ÿ˜¬_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜_"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Juan R.,13-Jun-17,5,Music and news at your fingertips!!  Can't beat it!_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè_
iHeartRadio,Home away from home,Joel Johnson,21-Jun-15,5,"I moved for my career to a &#34;ethnically bland&#34; locale. This app keeps me in touch with major news/events in the USA that interest me while providing a steady stream of music that I enjoy, something that the local radio stations don't offer."
iHeartRadio,Deleted App,Larry  D.,27-Sep-13,1,"The Kindle Fire will not play the radio station.  You need to add Flash Player and the Kindle Fire will NOT download Flash Player so there is no listening to the radio on your Kindle.  I could try to reach Kindle Fire support by phone, but two experiences with their phone staff, they must be using an offshore support group that English is not their primary language nor the secondary language."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Claire Marie,14-Mar-17,5,enjoy
iHeartRadio,verlindarogers36@gmail.com,mae,22-Feb-14,5,"Love this station, the music they play is fantastic especially the blues stations.  The music they play is great better then what they play on Pandora.  But  don't get me wrong they play good music too.  I guess they both are good but i will give this station a five star rate."
iHeartRadio,best radio app ever,Justtakeachance,23-Dec-12,5,Don't listen to the people that say u need a Facebook account cause u don't. All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones  u make. Definitely worth downloading :)
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Kindle Customer,16-Apr-17,4,Good
iHeartRadio,Works great on KindleFire 8.9,sgw,4-Jul-14,5,"good selection of music to listen to.  I know that by listening I'm willingly submitting to Clear Channel's hive-mind brain conditioning, (that's a joke, folks, I just think they control a looot of the media & what we hear, already).

iHeartRadio,Listening to Sports is Good,HuntleyMC,3-Jul-13,3,"I do not use this app that often except to listen to Kent State University sports. The sound quality is good and continues to play with minimal buffering problems. Only really issue I have, and this could be with the channel I listen to, is that it seem there are about three or four commercials that are played every break. So when listening to a three  hours game this can be a little annoying toward the end."
iHeartRadio,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!,Alexis Jantzi,26-Jul-15,5,I love listening to music. I was easily able to download IHeart Radio and sign up and I was able to easily listen to music when ever I desire.  It's easy to use and it is all FREE.I would HIGHLY suggest other people getting this app.

iHeartRadio,I love Iheart radio for Kindle fire!,Gypsy,8-Apr-14,4,I get radio stations better than a radio. I enjoy the specialized stations (especially Relaxation & meditation radio.) I have not yet made my own stations but I can't wait! The alarm is loud and clear. I know I am nit picking but the only fault I can find with this app is I would like it to have multi alarms especially since I usually forget time reading on my kindle.
iHeartRadio,"IF YOU LIKE THE RADIO, YOU'LL LOVE THIS APP!",Dizzy Lizzy,25-Dec-14,5,"Wonderful app if you like listening to the radio. You can get most New York stations as well as other states, and music without commercials. I can't say enough good things about this app. Oh!!

iHeartRadio,Small things I need to address to those that wish to get this.,Amazon Customer,16-May-13,4,"When I'm jamming to the radio or playlists it will sometimes do that thing when it stops and goes. This does not bother me too much, but I feel it is important to mention. Another thing is YOU NEED A FACEBOOK ACOUNT. Since I have a Facebook this also does not bother me too much either, but that is an important issue with this app.On the upside you do not need to continually login to Facebook.-CandyApplez"

iHeartRadio,It Improves,Bernie,22-May-14,4,"I didn't care for their earlier app versions, but switching to Android and using it pretty constantly over the last year on my tablet while traveling has been fun. New phone so added it without a lot of thought. Sign of a good app in my opinion. I wish the app had a little more audio control, but not too many audio apps for Android does."
iHeartRadio,Great Concept but Doesn't Work,Krista D. Meulengracht,22-Jul-13,1,"The idea of listening to your favorite station on the phone is awesome, but if I can ever get the app to actually play my station it quits after a few minutes. I must have dead zones in my neighborhood because it always dies in the same locations.I really wish it worked because I would listen every day - not allowed to stream at work and cannot get AM radio reception in my office building."
iHeartRadio,I use this app everyday! Reccomend it 100%,KindleFireLover,20-Oct-12,5,"This is one of my favorite apps. I use it on my Kindle Fire. If you love music, this app is perfect for you. You can listen to any radio station across the country! If you don't feel like listening to the radio, you can create your own custom station! Simply type in one of your favorite songs, singers, or bands. Similar music will play. If you like the song, give it a thumbs up. If not, give it a thumbs down and a new song will play. It is all 100% free!"
iHeartRadio,"I heart, I heart!",Mandy Reece,26-Mar-14,5,"This app is great! Compareable to Pandora, it saves my different stations, and when I listen on my phone I can amplify it in the car stereo via aux cable. No more flipping from local station to station and CD's on road trips. I heart, I heart! Even my kids have programed their favorites and the best part is that its free! I heart ""free"" too!"
iHeartRadio,Great radio app.,Kewl Clown,23-May-14,4,"I did not have to log in with Facebook.  This is a fantastic radio app.  It has lots of artists.  I intentionally searched for obscure entertainers and found them.  While it does have a filter for explicit content, it is an all or nothing approach.  The ads are not as obtrusive as they are on other apps.  And this has a quick load time."
iHeartRadio,Our family favorite,Nam,25-May-16,5,"So many reasons why I like iHeart Radio. For seasonal, all genres, and just because moments... I can even say - Birthday music or Sunday morning music and find something."

Weber,20-Sep-14,1,I don't understand this app. It is popular but I found it to be add - annoying and only worked occasionally.Maybe it's right for some but not for me.

iHeartRadio,Can't stop listening!!!!,stephanie,21-Aug-16,5,I love it!!!! Has me thinking of getting rid of my Sirius radio!! I even put it on my kindle fire so I can listen on my phone in the car and at home.
iHeartRadio,I love that you can make your own channels or pick ...,Tiffani Haley,11-Dec-15,5,I love that you can make your own channels or pick existing ones. Not as many advertising interruptions as Pandora - a definite plus. Don't like that you are limited on the number of songs you can skip though.
iHeartRadio,I think for a streaming radio app this works just fine.!,marty sanders,27-Jun-16,5,I use iHeart Radio all the time.  My phone is not capable of the radio app's that use an internal tuner.  I think for a streaming radio app this works just fine.!

iHeartRadio,"love it, man",Candace Patrice,15-Jan-14,4,"I absolutely love iheart radio.  Usually I can find what ever I want to listen to and be pretty entertained.  My only qualm is  that it seems that they have very limited rights to some of my favorite artist.  This results in hearing the same playlist in random order over and over if you happen to tune in for longer than an hour.  Otherwise, I heart, iheart radio."
iHeartRadio,Hate It,Wolf Blitzer,25-Oct-14,1,It's awful! I hate how it doesn't actually gives me the song I want. It gives other songs. My Niece wanted the Lion King &#34;I Can't wait to be king&#34; but it gave her &#34;what does the Fox say&#34; She was mad. It's awful! DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now I can listen to all my favorites, &  I can listen to Christmas songs now!!"
iHeartRadio,Not user friendly,JY,7-Aug-13,2,"Still can't figure out where the button is to stop the app and use its alarm clock.  I always have to shut down my Kindle completely to shut this app.  And I hate the FB stuff.  I have an FB account and entered it already but it is still asking for it over and over again.  Unless I'm locked up far away in a foreign country and misses the local radio stations, I don't want to use this app at all."
iHeartRadio,Awesome!,Kindle Customer,10-Dec-15,5,iHeartRadio is unlimited with songs and radio stations like radio Disney or Z100... you can also even create an alarm that wakes you up in the morning with a radio station of your choice.
iHeartRadio,"i use it every day and really lile it, but...",Janna Smith,31-Jul-14,3,"Pretty easy to use and lots of variety.  The app just quits often, if i wait long enough it does come back, but usually i am too impatient and start it up again myself.  The recent update did not fix that.  Also, it seems to forget my favorites for a day or so, then they come back.  That said, i do use it daily anyway."
iHeartRadio,Love that it plays songs without commercials between them,April Fordham,12-Mar-16,5,Love that it plays songs without commercials between them. Also like that there is not a long pause between songs. Absolutely love that you can listen to any genre from any time period.

iHeartRadio,My Music,underarmourfreak,24-Jul-14,5,I love this app. I listen to it everywhere! I make my own stations with my favorite song (fancy) and it plays some music that is similar and if I don't like it thumbs down and it doesn't play it anymore but if I do like it than a big thumbs up!!! You should totally get this app!! I hope my review was helpful. Thanks bye

This app was one of the only apps I found that worked. I liked the option of shuffling radio stations if the current radio station isn't playing what I like. You can sort what you want to listen to by genre. You won't be able to login and create an account, but you can still use the app."

iHeartRadio,good but only couple things....,Adam,1-Nov-13,4,"It works great. It's better than pandora by a lot. The only thing I see wrong with it is that when I type ""metallica radio"" I want to listen to metallica. Not every other band that exists.

iHeartRadio,Just In Time For Sandy,kmc7002,7-Nov-12,5,"I downloaded this app just before Hurricane Sandy hit.  I was not in the storm, but my family was.  I was able to listen to radio stations in their area and find out what was going on.  While they had no power I could listen to stations they could not get on their portable radios and keep them informed until they got power and cable back.  I also really like the custom stations because the radio stations in my area have changed formats."
iHeartRadio,Love it!,me,26-May-14,5,I love this app because I can listen to all my favorite artists and discover new ones! So far there has been no commericals and the only downfall is that you only get six skips per station but it's better than none. I highly recommend because it's a great way to find new artists and to further discover your tastes in music.
iHeartRadio,Rate a 10 Star,D. walker,21-Mar-15,5,Since my iPhone came with iTunes radio I wanted something I could use w/o signing in all the time.

iHeartRadio,Works Fine Lacks Features,PaulR,2-Dec-12,3,"I guess you can't blame Clear Channel for wanting to protect the internet delivery of its station content, but this app is a long way from its competitors in terms of features.  The stations play well enough, but there is no record, pause, rewind, etc.  Also, while I haven't checked exhaustively, the station list appears to be only Clear Channel.  I was irritated when they stopped TuneIn and Stitcher from carrying their stattions."
iHeartRadio,Can't turn it off on kindle fire hd,cat,25-May-14,1,"Even hitting exit doesn't turn it off.  Due to lag times and gaps it would seem to be off,  it was also removed from the carousel but then it started playing again.  The music was ok.

iHeartRadio,I liked it,L Miller,11-Nov-15,4,Very nice app.Wish it had more blues options. The commercials (which allow this app to be free) are not off-putting.  It's a rougher version of Pandora with a more contemporary selection of target music.

I have built my own station and can pick and choose which music I want to hear. Christian music is hard to find. I can't seem to find the local station I like on here but building my own is just as good if not better. After all if I don't like the song, I give it a thumbs down and hear it no more! Love this app!!!"
iHeartRadio,Don't get this app,Holly Bell,26-Jun-15,1,"If you don't have a Facebook account you can only listen to 80's music and carp like that nothing else. If you don't have a facebook account and you like Calvin Harris, Taylor swift, and Ed Sheeran I recommend you don't get it."

iHeartRadio,Great radio/song app!!!!,SoftwareDiva,10-Apr-12,5,"This is a great radio/song app. I am not sure about those reviewers who said you needed a Facebook account for this app to work, but I was able to rate songs, create radio station, save stations, etc. all with using an email address and password (no Facebook account). I chose not to get daily emails upon sign up so I don't get spammed. I think I like this better than Pandora because I hear more variety and less repeats as well as newer artists. Thumbs up!!!"

I like that I can listen to new bands I would have never heard if it wasn't for this app. Also very much like the artist bio, and the fact that some many artists have them! Overall great app, besides the skip limit. Only negative comment here."
iHeartRadio,Great app!,Amazon Customer,11-Jun-14,5,I love the mix of songs on this site. I prefer a wide mix and it has everything you can think of. It's really easy to use and stays playing while you move on to other apps. One suggestion would be a rating system for likes and dislikes instead of thumbs up to be more intuitive. Great app that I use daily.

Be aware that if the station has advertising, you will be listening to it, too. It is only remotely similar to Pandora, which is where you create your own stations. That may be a possibility on this app. But for now, I enjoy the stations I have chosen and saved. Enjoy!"

iHeartRadio,Make your own station,pooham,14-Mar-13,5,"Lots of stations to choose from. And if you want you can create a station based upon a song or artist. The app will play songs it thinks you may like based upon your selection and all you have to do is choose a thumbs up or thumbs down for the songs it picks and it automatically adjusts the selection it chooses based on your votes for the songs. As my father would say, it's ""real neat."""

iHeartRadio,ain't got no money? dis it,cool man,14-Aug-14,5,Do you want to spend money on songs? No. Get this app now. Only problem is the songs aren't there so you have to look for a different song by the same artist and you'll probably find it. Awesome app.
iHeartRadio,No Shuffle.,M.Andersen,12-Dec-14,1,"This app is almost awesome, but becase it's missing what I view as a fundamental listening function (shuffle) it is as good as garbage for me.  The ability to shuffle my favorite stations would make it a five star. Without shuffle it is just unrealized potential."

iHeartRadio,My favorite online music source...,SHolmes,17-Feb-14,4,"I like Pandora as a source of music online, but IHeart Radio has more variety and a better catalog of big band, jazz and standards. I would have given IHeart a ""5,"" but sometimes it is a little slow in identifying the current selection, and occasionally doesn't identify it at all. Other than that, it's a ""5."""

I will change my rating once I've tried this out a little longer."

iHeartRadio,No Intereruptions,C. Cantu,12-Mar-13,5,I used to use Pandora but I hated the commercials. I use my Kindle for my baby to have white noise in the form of music while traveling.

It plays just what I like with minimal input from me & doesn't quit in the middle of the night. Love it!
iHeartRadio,great app,Njkm33,24-Mar-14,5,"I've been using this app for a while now- probably a year.

So I just turn on my computer and I have all the music I like at the click of my mouse.
iHeartRadio,Best 'radio' for oldies!,overthehill,23-Jul-16,5,Love the oldies and 60's music.  Easy to use and change stations.  Since Pandora has gone into politics this is my only radio.
iHeartRadio,love this app!!,Falon Nonnemacher,1-Sep-13,5,its rare that i can listen to screamo on the radio and with this app u can listen to any band u want and related bands....for free!!!! love thisapp :3
iHeartRadio,Nice list of independent stations with different types of music,Amazon Customer,11-Aug-16,4,Similar to Pandora. Nice list of independent stations with different types of music. Much better than local radio by far.
iHeartRadio,Great music app,Amazon Customer,23-Dec-12,5,first of all u don't need facebook (or it hasn't asked me) ht with this app if you make an account you can make your own stations and put in a band lets say lady gags and it will play songs by her and songs by other bands in the same genre (rock pop etc) I use this a lot and the songs are good. one warning it wont play a famous song 10 times in an hour it plays famous and not famous songs which I like
iHeartRadio,Love it,Kindle Customer,29-Oct-13,5,Love that you can listen to stations all over the country.  We don't have stations around my home that plays the music I like so this is great.
iHeartRadio,I love  iHeartRadio,Lizzy,1-Nov-13,5,"I love listening to my iHeartRadio channels. I enjoy listening to talk shows on WISN 1130 during the daytime hours. You also have the opportunity to text a word on some of these shows for the chance  to win $1000.00. If you are one of the winners, you also have a chance to win $50000.00 in the big drawing. It's a win win all the way around!!!"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,simon86,13-Feb-17,5,"I love country and the oldies, they play all the time while I work. Just reallygreat"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,sylveera,22-Dec-16,5,Love Heart radio.  And my granddaughter has it on every night and plays it all night long.
iHeartRadio,Music to my ears!,Amazon Customer,2-Feb-17,5,"I enjoy being able to find all my favorites, create listings, channels. I use it everyday!"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,31-Jan-17,5,I love it. I can listen to 80s music instead of current music on the radio and it's great.
iHeartRadio,GET THIS APP!!!!,Venessa Nunez- Padgett,10-Mar-16,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE thus app. I was using Slacker for years and I'm so glad I switched. The app doesn't use a ton of data or my battery. I HIGHLY recommend it.
iHeartRadio,"Good app, custom stations could use some work",Brandon,7-Mar-13,4,This app provides great access to stations you want nationwide. It is easy to use and easy to save your favorite stations. My only gripe is in the custom stations you setup for yourself (Pandora style). The songs they play on these I sometimes really hate. It's not necessarily that it is in the wrong genre but the song is just terrible. Cut the crap music out and it would be much better.
iHeartRadio,Amazing music app!,Denelle Peterson,19-Oct-13,5,"This app is perfect for your kindle fire when reading a book.First, I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift. It plays one or two songs of hers first, then it plays the songs she listens to. It is great for iPhones or Ipod Touches, when jogging, shopping, or even at the gym. I would prefer this app a lot more then Pandora or WorldWide Radio."
iHeartRadio,Best Online Music,Estefan Urrea,5-May-14,5,"Sometimes once in a while i may listen to Spotify or Pandora, but Iheart Radio is simply the best by far. I live in Califrnia and get to sit back and listen to East Coast music from New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Philly."
iHeartRadio,1 stars! Worst app ever.,this person,27-Feb-15,1,"I only put up with this stupid app because I don't have any other music. It stops and exits your songs and doesn't always work. If you value your music like me, just buy it. It's not worth it to sit around trying to make this stupid app work."
iHeartRadio,Great Music App!!!,Mr. T,11-Oct-12,4,"It is a great streaming music app. Nice grafics, you can add artist that I would not imagine that they would have, I like Native American Flute music and I was able to add all of my favorite artist, also nice selection in New Age Music. Definitely a keeper the only reason I do not give it a five star is because it does not have a timer that can turn it off like Songza and Pandora has better sound quality options."
iHeartRadio,why cry?,Kindle Customer,4-Feb-12,5,what is everyone crying about? I downloaded it for my kindle fire and it works great! Also I need to point out that you do NOT need facebook to sign up or in. It is an option ONLY! Seriously people don't choose not to download something simply cuz others weren't satisfied and couldn't figure things out for themselves. If you do not have or want to have a facebook account then just create your own iheartradio login. It gives you the option for either or.
iHeartRadio,Not pleased with their choices,Michael Hill,26-Feb-14,2,I don' t like the limited skips. Why limit my choices for what you want to hear. iHeart sucks on there choices of songs for your created station...to avoid skips Pandora allows you to make a list of artist that you want to hear on your created stations and makes there suggestions also...so I find myself using Pandora.
iHeartRadio,But it was nice streaming from when it worked,tee.s,15-Aug-16,2,It kept cutting off. Don't know why??  But it was nice streaming from when it worked!  I deleted the app from my phone.

iHeartRadio,Great!!!,Soupy,19-Mar-14,4,So fun to be able to hear fav stations from other places.One of the hard things about moving is losing some of thefavorite things that one loved about that place.  I shallalways feel displaced without the stations of my youth andlo and behold-here they are back in my life again.  Yippee!!!
iHeartRadio,I tried to listen to the Steelers game on WDVE ...,Edward R.Cook,13-Nov-14,2,I tried to listen to the Steelers game on WDVE Pittsburgh and I got a message saying that I could not listen to the game on IHEART Radio.  that was the only reason I got IHEART Radio in the first place and then I coudln't listen to the game so I deleted the app.

iHeartRadio,dont be fooled by negative reviews,MWdragon,20-Dec-12,5,Don't let the negative reviews sway you're decision. This app is awesome. It doesn't require Facebook it does require an account which you can easily sign up for with an email address if you don't want to use Facebook. All in all a great app...I was hesitant at first but have been pleasantly surprised. Great quality sound and easy to customize personal stations. Can't beat the price of free either.
iHeartRadio,really good music,kathy hyde,1-Nov-14,5,"I love every song they play. I know that when I choose a station, they're are going to actually play the artist that I've requested along with other artists who play the same type of music. It's my cleaning, dancing, driving and relaxing music. It's just perfect:)"
iHeartRadio,I'm JAMMING!,Luna,25-Mar-15,5,"This app is awesome. It has different radio stations that you can tailor them to your personal liking. Live talk show s are being broad casted, and custom stations can be tinkered a bit so they play exactly what you want. Awesome app!"
iHeartRadio,Awesome selections,John Callaghan,15-Aug-15,5,It's great to have all these selections at my fingertips. I wish my local radio stations played as good songs as some of the others but this is a fantastic radio &#34;dial&#34;. I appreciate it.

iHeartRadio,keep the music coming,CASKETT,6-Apr-15,4,Love listening to this app. Sometime it freezes bit but come clear. I like it let you pick what you want to listen to. Then the app offer different stations. It offer music depending on what you are doing ex. Housework to exercise.
iHeartRadio,"Good App, Free.",Richard Allen,9-Jul-13,4,"One of the better free applications out there for Kindle Fire. Tons of radio stations and uses very little bandwidth. I find that I have it on my Kindle while I am on my desktop working. If you are a big radio listener, this app will be great for you.Only negative is it keeps asking me to connect with Facebook which gets annoying.4.1 / 5"
iHeartRadio,LOVE!!!,Amazon Customer,5-Oct-17,5,Love!
iHeartRadio,Great App but it burns up my battery!,speedracertech,7-Oct-15,3,"I like the app itself better than Pandora. Better variety of music and fewer commercials. However, the app frequently restarts and uses up my battery. I had no choice but to Uninstaller it."
iHeartRadio,so it's nice to have the radio stations I love in the ...,kendra,11-May-16,4,"I no longer have a radio in the house, so it's nice to have the radio stations I love in the car with me whenever I want to listen to them."
iHeartRadio,Love it,Joyce Boren,26-Mar-15,5,"I love this app, you can build your own station which I like, there is an occasional commercial, but it doesn't bother me as I don't look at the phone while the music is playing. I also installed it on my laptop and my Kindle Fire HD"
iHeartRadio,IHeartRadio,CM,12-Sep-14,4,"I've enjoyed all that iHeartRadio  brings. The variety of music that can be downloaded, the option to keep the song,or discarded for next time, is  a feature I like. Not to mention its a free app. I would recommend it for those who don'thave Pandora or a iPhone."
iHeartRadio,It won't go away!,Happy Mama,12-Mar-14,2,"I downloaded this app, it worked fine the first time I tried to use it. Then the screenWent black. I keep trying to uninstall it and it keeps coming back. It's always trying to load in the background. No matter how many time I tell it to remove from device it still keeps coming back! It is driving me nuts!"
iHeartRadio,it has everything!!!!,Scott J Carlson,26-Apr-15,5,Type in the artist or song and it will build you the station that has more songs from the same artist. I'm listening it to it right now!it even shows you the lyrics.... push it real good!! That's the song I'm listening to now.

iHeartRadio,This is my radio now,tryanmax,26-Dec-13,5,"Like the title says, this app has replaced the radio for me. It's got a short learning curve to figure it out, so it's not perfectly intuitive, but it is really easy. I like this better than Pandora. The only strike against is that there is no on-screen volume control. (If I just haven't found it, please reply and correct me.)"
iHeartRadio,Great free Internet radio,Terry Lytle,11-Nov-16,5,Great free radio. Sometimes gets a little glichty after a while but might just be the Internet.
iHeartRadio,"Love, Love, Love it!",BooBoo,24-May-14,5,I love this app. I never cared much for Pandora or Jango and had problems with their apps.  I 'never' have any problems with iheart and love it because you can get local stations as well as all over the country.
iHeartRadio,music lover......,nice,1-Jan-14,5,I have had this app for about 2 years now and I love it. There are many genre and stations to choose and you can build your own favorites. No problems.

iHeartRadio,LOVE iHeart Radio!,Noemi,18-Jun-14,5,"I LOVE iHeartRadio, I enjoy it the most when I'm cooking, cleaning and playing games on my Kindle.

Right now its garden season so most of my energy is going into getting the garden going.  Anyway it was easy to download and seems to  be easy to use.  I found my favorite local station with ease and have it set to go.  Now that I'm writing this I realize that I can take it outside and listen while I garden. lol
iHeartRadio,I heartish radio,Stephanie Hurley,9-Aug-13,3,"This app is nice because its free. I find the songs repeat a lot on the custom built stations. The song volume is hard to control too. One song loud..one song not loud enough.  I like pandora more but, I listen to I heart radio more because there is no limit on the amount of time I can listen. I don't listen to the commercial stations on I heart radio."

iHeartRadio,Rating could change after more usage,James K. Sutherland,12-Jan-14,4,I haven't used it long enough to rate it accurately.  I have only had my Kindle for about three weeks. So far it sounds very good and once I gain more confidence in using the features my rating could change.  It does use more battery power than I expected but to have a good product there has to be sacrifices.  Thank you.
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Lawrence Wexler,7-Jun-17,4,love free music

iHeartRadio,Decent rotation,Mesia412,4-Sep-13,5,This is the only music app I listen to. The commercials are a lil annoying because you can't exit them. But other than that... love this app!
iHeartRadio,It doesn't quit playing until you turn it off. ...,bethanysr,15-Sep-15,5,It doesn't quit playing until you turn it off.  One night I couldn't sleep so I turned it on and I went to sleep.  Woke up to Carrie Underwood singing.  Turned it off and went back to sleep.
iHeartRadio,love it,Pen Name,19-Feb-16,5,This app gives yo a whole bunch of songs you can listen to and if my tablet goes dead and I charge it up again it will sometimes go to where it left off.
iHeartRadio,A must have!,Rocketman,5-Apr-14,5,Most of us have stations we listen to. And that is what we want to have available when on the road. This app takes care of that nicely. It is very good for me as I listen to AM stations and most cell phones that do offer a radio are usually FM only. Nice layout. Easy to configure. Just a well done app.

iHeartRadio,Good App,Madison T. Edwards,28-Nov-15,5,This is such a good app. I started off with Pandora but it tried to force me to pay after awhile. This app is very easy to use and I can listen to any kind of music I want.
iHeartRadio,i love this app,Edwin J.,30-May-14,5,"This game is so addicting and fun, I cannot stop playing it after a high score because I'm always wanting to beat it. It's not as irritating as Flappy Bird considering you feel a lot better once you beat your high score in this. You can put down Flappy Bird but you can't put this game down."
iHeartRadio,Review,Messiah516,15-Jan-15,5,This is great a radio of my own.

I like opera and classical, my wife easy listening and Latino, my youngest rock and POP and we have all found several good stations.So, in short, get it, it is great"
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio Does not make the grade.,Wayne,18-Mar-14,1,iHeartRadio is not a user friendly App. It is difficult to set up and to navigate. I can't stand an App that feels it is necessary to send you a message at all times of day or night to tell you absolutely useless information. I have uninstalled this App and hope that the developers will make improvements.
iHeartRadio,Keeps me connected!,Robynne Moore,3-Feb-15,5,"I recently relocated to another city who doesn't have the type of music that I enjoy, at least I have not discovered it.  That's okay because I can listen to my favorite Hallelujah 1600 AM all the way from home in St. Louis, MO!  Yes!!!!"
iHeartRadio,"Mostly works, okay for a free app.",Rosa's Cabin Computing,17-May-15,5,"Great app.  A bit buggy, but at least it mostly works.  I realize all tablets are different so I don't expect perfection from all apps;  I was totally unable to connect on the browser with iheart.com, until this app."
iHeartRadio,not as good as prior version,drsquad,8-Sep-12,4,"I have used this for as long as it has been available. The latest versions do not allow the user to save favorite stations unless they have a facebook account, which I do not. The prior versions allowed this, which is obviously a timesaver so as not to have to go searching through multiple cities and stations to get to the ones I wish to listen. Otherwise the selection is quite good and I use it quite often."
iHeartRadio,Best app ever.,This is a great app. My recommendation hands down.,21-Sep-13,5,Always trustworthy an  does not cause any viruses or anything like other radio apps .This is a great app. My recommendation hands down

iHeartRadio,Great app with many stations,William P. Maura,16-Nov-16,5,"Works great, you get access to a lot of stations across the country.It works great."
iHeartRadio,privacy matters,Lyn Pyle,5-Jun-15,1,"I deleted this app. A streaming music service doesn't need to know my phone number or blackberry ID. It doesn't need to have access to my files. The price for this app, which is essentially a radio, is too high."
iHeartRadio,awesome,player,6-Apr-14,5,I really like this app because 1# you get to listen to all the radio stations you like on your tablet or phone and is perfectly free and 2# you get to switch on your apps and still listen to your favourite radio stations while playing on your device/phone so if you like music this is the app for you.
iHeartRadio,One Star,Amazon Customer,16-Oct-16,1,They keep saying they can't find me ...don't know what's going on ...I'm not all that tech smart
iHeartRadio,I recommend,William,13-Aug-17,5,I am enjoying the music and watching movies on my fire hd tablet.I recommend both

iHeartRadio,love it,samantha (samuel),25-Mar-14,5,"Theres no annoying ads, its way better in that way compared to pandor. Pandora tends to crash randomly as of recent when it only plays for maybe 20 minutes. Its even been recently updated too, which is awful for it to act that way. No problems so far with it, plus u get to listen to live radio as well."
iHeartRadio,I am very happy listening to iHeartRadio,Billibob A.,9-Jul-15,4,"I am very happy listening to iHeartRadio, the choices of music the variety of music they play.  I use to listen to Pandora but they always play the same songs over and over and over so l quit using them."
iHeartRadio,decent app,Catherine Dowd,27-Jan-15,3,I think the developers are going in the right direction with this app. One thing that still puzzles me is when I search for specific song then it will sometimes choose similar song and not the song I was searching for in the first place.
iHeartRadio,Does not live up to the hype,Janis,21-Apr-14,2,"It does not appear that on the app for the Android that you can save individual songs, but must listen to an entire album.  Also, the app keeps shutting down and interrupting me while I'm doing other business on my phone.  I'm glad this app was free because it really does not live up to the hype."
iHeartRadio,Stupendous App.,Chuck,7-Aug-14,5,"I was skeptically about loading this app. at first... but now, after playing around with for a while, I find myself asking, ""where the heck has this app. been all my life?!?!""

iHeartRadio,Amazing radio,Sornia Joseph,20-Aug-15,5,I can enjoy radio radio out of the car  and keep track with trends. And listen to radio only with specific rappers and singers like Drake lil Wayne Chris Brown Ed sheren Nokia minage  Fetty wap

iHeartRadio,Love this program!,Kimmirr,7-Aug-12,5,"Anyone who has not tried iHeart Radio is just out of touch.  What a great idea!  You can listen to local area stations for whatever genre you enjoy, or one of the 800 other stations in the US.  There are preset stations, my two favs are Today's Mix and Smooth Jazz, or you can create your own station.  Just plug in an artist or song, and the program will find you music in that genre.  I think this is pure genius!!"
iHeartRadio,Love iHeart radio,martha miller,4-May-15,5,"I didn't know what to expect, but it was really easy to select the genres and it went straight to the radio stations I listen to. Very easy to choose the specific station. I really like it, so I can have it on the go."
iHeartRadio,THE BEST,Shayne,6-Aug-14,5,"As long as you can manage it u can listen to the BEST of the BEST songs all on ur own station.....l have made two and it is the best....l mean I'm in my 30s so my music taste is big hair bands, 80s music, ya know stuff u just don't hear on the radio anymore...THE BEST!!!!!!"

iHeartRadio,It works great on my Kindle but I had to remove it ...,J. W. Garner,31-Aug-15,3,It works great on my Kindle but I had to remove it from my phone.  When the last update came through it started playing without me starting the app and would not stop till I removed the app.
iHeartRadio,Awesome app,Christian,28-Nov-14,5,I really love this app! At least I used to. I haven't used it enough since the update to form a good opinion on the new user interface. Sound quality is still good though. Iheartradio has songs that I am unable to find on YouTube (the same version).
iHeartRadio,great for anything!,Jessica Vint,10-Sep-14,5,"I love this app! In the moment music is played 24/7. I don't have to buy individual songs from the app s tore anymore. It is overall a great app for workouts, taking a shower, in the car on a long ride, and any other activities. Over all I can't complain. I love it."
iHeartRadio,I heart radio,Goldies Mama,16-Nov-12,5,"I like this station, mainly because I live in the country and I get few stations without static on my Bose radio. Mainly I use to listen to  talk radio, which in my town is an am station.Being on my cell phone, means I always have a radio with me."
iHeartRadio,Good but could be better.,Syrsly,17-Mar-15,4,It has a very simple UI.  I like simple.The music is not categorized very well.  I also must mention that the stations aren't always live streams but instead a collection of individual songs generated for you alone.
iHeartRadio,"""It's better than sliced bread""",Linda Mathis,2-Dec-14,5,"I am really enjoying this program. As the saying goes, ""It's better than sliced bread"". But it's far better than that.

iHeartRadio,I can choose from different song categories like Pandora.,Dee Bee,16-Oct-15,4,"I can't get a radio signal at my job but thanks to this app, I can still hear live radio. When my morning show is not on, I can choose from different song categories like Pandora."

iHeartRadio,GoWithYouEverywhere Music,Carolynn B,9-Oct-12,5,"Wow, this is the best way to have music or radio with you always. Even worked traveling through the mountains where local stations frequently fade. You can create your own playlists; and with the capability to like or dislike the current song, you are able to quickly insure that what you truly like is the kind of music that is played.  And, it's commercial free after the first intro.  Really cool!"
iHeartRadio,Great music!,Gayle J Warner,11-Dec-15,5,"I _Ÿ’“ My Heart Radio! I listen on my Fire and also Amazon Echo. Start with your favorite music style, artist or song and they find similar music that you might like!"

My father left me a hell of a collection that I enjoy tremendously. This is a perfect radio station for my entire family. If you're a jazz buff like me this is the smoothest place to be.
iHeartRadio,Love this!,Ashly D.,23-Apr-14,5,Way better than Pandora in my opinion. I love that you can listen to any radio station or create your own.The only con I can think of is the skip limit but I just switch stations (I made a few stations of the same type of music for this purpose) to bypass the not letting you skip thing.
iHeartRadio,_Ÿ_¶LOVE IT!!_Ÿ_¶,ronda greeN,20-Jul-15,5,"I like thats it gives you lots of channels and artists to chose from and I think its cool that you made it so you can listen to music when your playing games or other stuff, thanks for making _Ÿ’œ _Ÿ˜„"

iHeartRadio,i like it.,Kindle Customer,24-Feb-13,4,the only things I don't like about this app is that its about 10-20 seconds delay on the live radio so don't use it if your trying to win a contest on the radio lol and the other thing is I have to Internet inorder to use it.I like it because it tells you who sings the song and the name of it. I suck at remembering the sames of the songs so its a huge bonus for me :)
iHeartRadio,Great station,Lorry Norton,1-May-13,4,"You are able to get tons of stations, some that are live, and some that are created, such as the Beatles/Rolling Stones station. That one plays ONLY Beatles and Rolling Stones. Perfect!  I found stations in Hawaii that play traditional Hawaiian music, which I love. You can get stations from any state in the country. And they are very clear. This is a great app."

iHeartRadio,Responsive,Ricki D,11-Mar-15,4,I like this app better than Spotify-it doesn't keep trying to force me to log into facebook. Also it seems more responsive to my preferences. The only thing missing is that it doesn't seem to save my favorite songs anywhere.
iHeartRadio,Awesome,Andrea Wesley,19-Mar-15,5,I love love love I heart radio! It is the best with creating custom midi stations. I can every type of music every song every artist that I love to listen to. Radio stations in other states and cities just totally awesome.

iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio 50 minute workout genre,Amazon Customer,9-Jul-14,2,I use the 50 minute workout mostly and the music is too slow or inappropriate language for working out. There must be much better music than what they use for working out. I am down arrowing all of the music that I don't like in hopes of never having to listen to it again.

I am deleting it and sticking with I heart!"
iHeartRadio,Great App,Logan J. Ramsey,15-Dec-15,5,"I usually download my music (using free mp3 downloader off of 1mobile) but love using this app to listen to the radio, discover new songs, and listen to comedy"
iHeartRadio,Bad Buffering When Looking at Older Posts,Meca N Denham,17-Feb-14,3,"I like the app, as long as I am looking at current pics and videos.  If looking at older posts, the app freezes while buffering, then asks ""The app isn't responding.  Would you like to close the app, or wait?""  If you wait, it may completely freeze, or you may get lucky and the video may play."
iHeartRadio,useful,great,15-Oct-15,4,"I love it I only gave it 4 because you can't get there bests songs and u have to pay for some new artist but it's awesome also there was no halves so it would of been 4, 1/2"

iHeartRadio,The best app for music,William E Lambert,3-Mar-15,5,"If there a music app said easier to use, tell me. The definition of plug and play is iHeart Radio app. Recommend to any music lover. If iHeart does not have the genre, artists or song, does not exist or not worth listening."
iHeartRadio,great app,Shaun C Mooney,2-Jun-15,4,So far I'm loving this app.. It plays the type of music I enjoy without so many advertisements. Only gave 4 stars because I haven't used it long enough yet to determine if I want to put a ring on it..lol

iHeartRadio,Amazing App!,Will Barron,3-Mar-14,5,"I love the sleep music timer on the app. Every night I'll set it for an hour, and every song I hear stays within the genre of music I like. Also, when people think that me listening to the radio is obnoxious, I can just listen to stations with my headphones in. This is so much better than Pandora!"
iHeartRadio,Great music!,R.Lynch,28-Sep-13,4,Great music but you need to have speakers in the headphone jack to listen to the music pr else it is really quiet. So my advice to ClearChannel who created this would be to make the music LOUDER so we can hear or make the stations turn it up. Now my advice to the buyers would be keep calm and listen to your music with speakers.
iHeartRadio,I can get my New York channels at the Jersey Shore!,madeline,2-Dec-13,5,I can never get a clear signal for WOR710 NY in my home at the Jersey Shore.Now I can take my kindle fire around the house with me and hear all my favoritepersonalities any time. I can hear them when I wake up with the alarm too.Some times it shuts off for no reason? I am still happy with the app.
iHeartRadio,Pretty good.,Hiraffa,18-Nov-15,4,Very good sound quality. No way to remove recommended stations from their list. I like Tunein for its facility in searching and organizing selections from all over.

iHeartRadio,"I do not see the point in a radio app that requires internet,when you ca get Prime Music and play with no internet needed",Lila,7-Dec-14,2,"I only had this app in for a short time, it is hard to figure out. I prefer goingto the Amazon Prime musicstore, and getting my music from there. If you get the music from Prime Music you can play it anywhere you go, no need for internet ."
iHeartRadio,Could use some tweaking,Janice,8-Jun-13,3,"I like that I am able to create 'channels' that I like to hear.  What I DON'T like is when suddenly a song, from another of my channels, starts playing, yet the picture shown is a totally different song. For example: Blake Shelton channel is 'playing' and suddenly Michael W Smith comes in. Not that I don't like both artists, but this is irritating!"
iHeartRadio,Great,Sheena,23-Jan-13,5,I can listen to all my old stations from the sixty's to the ninety's plus program the singer's I like the most

iHeartRadio,From Radio,T. Alexander,31-Aug-13,5,This is great to listen to while I'm doing what I do on the computer. Some of the channels I can't get even if they are in my area.
iHeartRadio,This is a app I would suggest to any music or talk radio lover!,DarbeeZB,10-Jun-13,5,Simply love being able to listen to music and talk radio shows while reading or playing on my Kindle Fire!
iHeartRadio,Great Idea...,Priceless,23-Apr-13,5,"Whoever came up with the idea to stream radio stations throughout the US should be thanked a million times....This app is perfect for someone like myself who hate to listen to the same ole local radio stations...I have a variety to listen to and it works well on my Kindle Fire.....I also like the idea of creating my own stations and having the option to like or dislike the songs they choose for me...Unlike Pandora, IHeartRadio is advertisement free when listening to your own created stations which is a plus."
iHeartRadio,good music but not much else,JWeb,9-Mar-14,3,"Good selection of music to listen to, but at the end of the day it's still just like a radio station.  You can't pick the songs, just the main artist.  Creating stations is a joke because each artist has a station.  Just another example of a &#34;choice&#34; without being able to choose."

iHeartRadio,Missing the stations I wanted.,BB_Pompano,29-Oct-15,1,It does not have the specific stations I hoped for.  NYC 1010Wins news is not there.  Also I could not figure out how to get the Mets World series ratio broadcasts.
iHeartRadio,Better than Pandora!,aanimec15,12-Feb-15,5,"I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it's better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora, when you're first starting out and you want to make your own station, you can't just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not, it's going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it'll give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that's it. Mind you I'm not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it's best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
iHeartRadio,It's Okay..I Expected Better,RTD,26-Oct-14,3,"Alot of hurdles in the set up process.  The programming line up appears to be heavily skewed to a very young listening audience.  My own tastes are in talk radio, opera, classical music, I prefer Tune In - better channel line up for my tastes."
iHeartRadio,Better than pandora,angel,18-Oct-16,5,I wish I could give it 10 stars . No commercials excellent song picks I'm in love.
iHeartRadio,commercials highly outrank music,MrMega,5-Dec-15,1,More commercials than music.  Can't change a station without an account.  Accuradio was perfect until Amazon hacked it off device now stuck with this trash

iHeartRadio,Two Stars,B. H. Edington,25-Jan-16,2,"The stations really aren't true to their title.  For example, several ""instrumental"" stations have vocals rather than all-instrumental."

iHeartRadio,Great app!,Crystal S,27-Nov-12,5,iHeart Radio has changed everything about the way we enjoy music! The app was easy to install and is very user friendly.  The format for searching for different stations is set up well.  We were able to find the stations we wanted then listen to them without any delay.  We even found a County Christmas 'station' that entertained us all afternoon as we put up the decorations.
iHeartRadio,Not as good as Pandora,Joel M. Shanus,9-Aug-13,2,Just a large corporate attempt to clone there version of Start Up Pandora. Canned music with their spin. When the came into the Charlotte area and purchased most of the radio stations the music they offered was limited and very commercial. Gone forever Independent Radio.

Not only do they have a lot of stations to choose from, you can create your own, and unlike Pandora, you actually get to hear songs from the artist you based the station on, instead of ""similar"" artists only.

iHeartRadio,"Eh, so-so",Shari Lyne DuShane,19-Jan-14,3,"I enjoy listening to music, but I found it difficult to add stations I want to listen to.  I found a few stations from other States, but not in the genre I wanted to listen to or was looking for.  I do listen to iHeartRadio on my desktop, just don't think I'll be using the Kindle app."
iHeartRadio,It's changed,Amazon Customer,15-Nov-12,3,"A lot of apps are changing nowadays. This has officially gotten worse. It used to not need Facebook or an account in order to access, but for some annoying reason it does now. Also, you know have limited skips in general. It used to just be limited skips per station. Now, it's limited skips for the whole app a day. They've changed their outlook. Not impressive."

iHeartRadio,Pandora is better,Pheobe,9-Mar-14,2,When I got this app I thought it was good but a few days later I found myself not using it at all. The only reason I don't love this is because you have to do a lot of work to get it on and to find your radio that you want. I just didn't like the arrangement on how it works!
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,2-Dec-16,5,Enjoy your radio very much the clarity and sound is great.

iHeartRadio,you  dont need facebook to sign up only email. fake reviews,RKIL,12-Feb-13,5,exactly like I said. either these reviews are fake or little Timmy should ask his parents permission before handling their daddy's kindle. works just like you'd imagine. radio 24 hrs a day. I love morning radio shows and news channels. doesn't have everything but I assume that's a contract thing with their company. hey its free stop complaining.
iHeartRadio,Lots of choices,Terry Peterson,20-Dec-12,4,"I forget I have this as I ""play"" on my Kindle Fire.  I downloaded it so I had it but lately have been playing while watching TV so haven't had the ""radio"" going too.  I'm sure I will use it more when I travel or am away from home and want some background noise.  I love the options for regular radio or ""making my own"" like Pandora."
iHeartRadio,Nice App,Kindle Customer,29-Dec-13,5,"Even though I am only about 70-80 miles away from Austin, Texas, the radio signal is affected by heat, cold, and obstacles.

iHeartRadio,Great Music App,BSK,25-Mar-14,5,"My hairdresser told me about this app as she is using this in her salon on her Kindle.

iHeartRadio,What a great invention,erice4335,2-Apr-13,4,The thing I like best about iHeart Radio is that I can listen to my local radio station no matter where I am. Recently a group of friends and I rented a house in the Caribbean and I could tune in and hear the morning drive show and the bad commute through snow while sitting on my rental house porch looking at the beach and ocean. Great!

iHeartRadio,Why do I need Facebook to use this app?,George,28-Sep-12,1,"From the outset, I found this iHeart app difficult to use, but it was the only one I could find that carried WLS-AM in Chicago after TuneIn dropped that station about a month or so ago. Now that Facebook is required I've given up fiddling with its unfriendly atmosphere. What an unwanted irritation to require a Facebook account to store one's favorites. Good bye iHeart forever!!!!!"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Danny Jones,17-Dec-16,5,Love all the different stations especially the oldies

iHeartRadio,great until most recent update,Jon,16-Jul-13,1,Was loving this app until the most recent update broke the alarm clock so that the alarm doesn't play the radio station if your device is asleep which it automatically will do especially if you're setting an alarm. Otherwise great app to listen to radio stations worldwide as well as creating your own custom stations.

And when a selection really strikes you, you can pursue, and click-to-buy it at Amazon.  How perrfect, eh?"

iHeartRadio,good app,Mikayla,11-Mar-14,4,"great app except for the stupid skip limits.  I don't see why there should be daily limits to how many times I can skip songs.  Jango does not have this, although jango has a terrible bug at the moment which makes me prefer this app despite the limit."

iHeartRadio,Down with Pandora,b3nP123,4-Feb-14,5,I think that Pandora is extremely inaccurate. And the design isn't very sleek. iheartradio allows listening to local radio stations along with custom ones. However to get good music mixes you need to thumbs down songs you don't want on your custom stations.
iHeartRadio,Very useful.,Katail,25-Aug-14,5,"I use this app all the time.  I travel a lot & can listen to all the local radio channels from my home base.  Keeps me up to date on home town news, weather.  Works very well after you get it all set up.  Very useful."

I just uninstalled it!"
iHeartRadio,Some people shouldn't review -,Pandah,18-Jul-12,5,"If you're going to complain about a -free- app wanting a -free- social site to use their services then don't use it.

iHeartRadio,AWESOME,Jennifer Smeth,3-Sep-14,4,"it is awesome but whenever you tap on a song there is sometimes a few songs before that. And it will only let you skip a few songs and then you won't be able to skip songs anymore, only if you go to their website."

iHeartRadio,my iHeart,tanquilla s taylor,13-Jun-14,4,"I love the variety that iHeart offers; however, it would be even nicer if they actually played the song searched for when building a station versus a random song either similar or from the album of the artist.. just a thought : )"

iHeartRadio,First,Michael Jimenez,25-Sep-16,5,Wonderful app no complaints
iHeartRadio,Email is required not facebook,Helen T,19-Apr-13,4,Many of the complaints stem from the facebook sign in. However you can use an email account. There is also an option in settings to disable facebook posts. One complaint I do have however is the last 20+ songs on one of my custom stations were in Spanish which could be a problem.
iHeartRadio,better than pandora,Julie A Kasten,5-Jun-15,5,I heart doesn't have any commercials while Pandora does. I use it here ever I go.I think it is one of the best apps in the app store.

iHeartRadio,Better than Pandora,Stef stef,1-Dec-13,5,By far I think iHeart radio is much better than Pandora so serious ........I ALWAYS recommend it to everyone I know. I use to have Pandora but it sucked so my friend told me about this app and I thought it was goona be dumb but it's awesome
iHeartRadio,It SUCKS!,LV02536,24-Mar-14,1,"The music is good but at one point I didn't need it so I uninstalled it, and it left me with a VIRUS! It drained my battery in 20 minutes! I had to reset my whole tablet and I lost all my stuff :'( I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"

iHeartRadio,Use on occasion but Pandora paid is far better.,Chris Hanser,17-Jun-15,3,Its nice...but stations are not too easy to find if you are looking for genre only. It helps to know what stations you like first.
iHeartRadio,it started out good.,Amazon Customer,25-Feb-14,3,but now It keeps freezing.  then I have to uninstall it and then download it all over again and they also do not give you enough skips and the like/don't like feature needs work because it keeps playing songs I thumbed down.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,steve,18-Dec-16,5,Love it
iHeartRadio,Best user interface of the internet radio stations,Amazon Customer,9-May-13,5,"I've tried all of the internet radio station apps and this one has the best interface. It's much easier to operate while driving down the road. The fact that it is completely free and doesn't have huge ads using up 90% of the screen space like, say, Pandora makes it superior."
iHeartRadio,amazing,Mnc Eski,7-Mar-15,5,Love iHeartRadio so much that I constantly listen to it often to all of my different channels. Easy to use and there is no ads to interrupt your music.

iHeartRadio,I love it! :),mandi&lt;33,25-Mar-12,5,"A lot of people are saying that you can't make your own station without making a facebook account, which is true. But, I don't really care about the make your own station thing. I loved that I could go anywhere on my kindle and have th music playing. It's a better alternative to buying a bunch of songs at the music store, in my opinion."

It was NOT streaming the game. So it didn't work for me. Don't know who's to blame -  the app or the radio station. Haven't used it since to see if it works for anything else. The only time I did use it I did not get what I was expecting...so, disappointed."

iHeartRadio,Has all the music/talk of your life........BUT,Sue Ellen,10-May-17,2,"We are in the market for a WI-FI radio for the deck.  After reading a few (like 12) reviews on the radio I am willing to pay $119.00 for.  Come to find out it won't pick up iHeartRadio!  What's up with that?? Do I have to pick a ""radio station"" first THEN buy a radio Just to receive the station of MY choice? That's crazy stupid.  I love iHeartRadio, here at my computer and I have used Whole house FM transmitters in the past to get the music off my PC to any FM radio and listen outside.  Having a Wi-Fi radio with iHeart would be perfect.  I'll keep the app on my pc and use it here and keep looking for a radio that will pick it up and use it out there.  Check Your radio if this was your idea for your outdoor life."

The musical ""channels"", meh.  The music channel songs and their composers are incorrect. One channel listed Mozart as the composer of Swan Lake. What! We all heard selections from Swan Lake played over and over just this past Christmas!  It was Tchaikovsky. The so-called band channels weren't exclusive. For instance, the Electric Light Orchestra radio channel isn't limited to ELO songs. Today, I heard Steely Dan, Journey & SuperTramp on the ELO channel. There were too many examples of wrong information. But, no one cares anymore..right, kids?"

iHeartRadio,Get This App - Be Aware It Runs All The Time,John Paul Moore,19-Jun-15,5,Sweet app - allows me to listen to the radio in an area that is so deep in a basement that no radio signal can penetrate.

iHeartRadio,Deleted the Application,Robert Hoadley,24-Jun-14,1,"I never really gave the application a try. It may be ok, but after reading their policy for what they planned to do with my personal information I could not agree.  Buyer beware. Read their information policy before using this app.  If you agree to it, don't be surprised when your information is all over the internet.  If you agree to their user policy you are basically giving them to the right to capture and share personal information with just about anyone. You can expect your junk content to go way up."

iHeartRadio,Horrible Sound Quality!,TG,14-Nov-14,2,"Downgrading from 3 stars to 2.  The TV interface is counterintuitive and half the features don't work properly.  Biggest reason - IHeart sounded great (via home surround sound system or phone) - in fact better than same stations tuned through receiver.  Then 6-8 weeks ago stream quality was REDUCED by more than half.  Sound quality is now horribly muffled and garbled, with constant feedback/hissing/static in background.  The quality is far too poor to listen too.  There's nothing left to heart about this app..."

It also continued to play strange songs on my B.T.S radio. It would claim they were songs by B.T.S but they were not by B.T.S, although the image they presented was of the South Korean hip hop group. Despite the artist mix up and the lack of diversity it was easy to navigate, so it does deserve two stars at least."

iHeartRadio,iHeart Spy-o,R2,26-Oct-14,1,"You have to wonder what really is behind this app. It delivers music, of course, and advertisements. But why on earth does this need to know where you are within a 5' radius?  It can easily determine which ads you should receive and which stations you are allowed to listen to by using COARSE location data.  It doesn't need GPS precision for anything other than to sell that information to whomever is interested in buying it.It runs at startup, running constantly in the background tracking your every movement even if you aren't listening to it.  Why?Plus, it gets your list of accounts on your device. All of them. Does Clear Channel need to know about all of your accounts on your Android?  If so, for what reasons?It's sickening what this app does, for no apparent reason other than to sell your personal, confidential accounts and location information."

iHeartRadio,This should be called I Hate Radio. It's junk. but you have to use it.,Marble68,17-Jun-13,1,"The fact that stations force people to use this POS makes me hate it even more.  I used to enjoy their stations via TuneIn Radio (5 stars, mobile radio done right) and these morons decided they didn't want to play well with others.This app is buggy. Takes *forever* to load. It has memory leak issues. It throws up stupid ads that mean one wrong touch and it's changing stations. It someone thinks it's lost it's connection. All sorts of BS.They tout it as popular. This app sucks. It's only popular because it's the only way to listen to some stations online.Rather than compete and make a better mobile radio product, they chose to be jerks and make a crappy one and not let anyone compete.Install it if these dolts bought one of the stations you like to listen to. It is or soon will be the only way to listen to them on your mobile device.  Prepare to be tracked and force fed ads, too.This is not a app written for a great user experience. This is an app written to track you and what you listen to and to make more ad revenue for these idiots at ClearChannel and Cumulus.  They're strategy is seems is to acquire stations with good content, micromanage that content so it's not as good as it was before, and then play gatekeeper with how to listen to it and force you into a sub par, feature poor, privacy exploiting, profit high experience."

I'm an oldschool girl who is always last to catch up with technology, and this app is one of my favorite all time finds! I've been stuck on my favorite local radio station in smalltown NH since I was a kid in the 80's. And now, no matter where in the world I go, I can listen to my favorite station with IHeart radio! I never have to miss a minute of my beloved early morning show, because not only can I listen to it streaming live through IHeart, but I can also listen to it on demand! It doesn't stop there, either! Oh no, you can create all the stations you want, categorized in a million ways! Create a station by typing in your favorite band and IHeart will play you all that bands most popular songs along with the greatest hits by bands of a similar genre. You have a thumbs up and down to rate every song IHeart plays for you and it remembers. You can even create your own personal station by choosing ""your favorites"". It will play all the songs you've rated with a thumbs up. This is by far the coolest app for any music maniac! And it's free!! So how can you go wrong??

iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio review,housweet,6-Oct-14,5,Pick your own channels.
iHeartRadio,"Nothings truly free people.  The Face Book requirement sucks, but here's my answer...  CHEAT!",MamaGonsalves916,21-Jun-13,4,"I'm glad I read the reviews of this app.  It looks like the only major complaint is the FB for certain functionality.  I have a FB account and get annoyed when I see popup notices that my old Highschool acquaintance is ""currently listening to Paranoid by Megadeth"", you get my drift, and I hope that won't happen to me if when I sign up.  I'm not sure if linking the iHeart Radio to my FB will do that and I also don't want to find out the hard way.  This is also EXTREME social media and somewhere in the fine print of that legal jargon nobody fully reads, they may (probably) get your authorization to access your contacts and more. My answer to this possible dilemma is, create a ghost FB account.  I have backed out of a few cool apps in the recent past because they have required FB, it's about time I conform to the masses, but not let them win :-)  So go ahead and enjoy this app and don't worry about the FB aspect, just cheat."

iHeartRadio,Good Clean Reception,James,17-Aug-13,4,"I was looking for an app that could deliver streamed radio from various locations.  I live in an area where there is only garbage talk radio and no other type.  I've found stations through the internet on my home computer, but wasn't able to enjoy it at work.  Enter iHeart.  At first it was a little buggy, dropping and the stream would cut out, but with recent updates, they seem to have solved the problem.  Also, I am running a Galaxy S3 with 4G and it does make a difference.  The cell reception at work was only showing 3G and is now showing 4G and I rarely experience interruptions. I don't mind the start up advertisement, hey a company's got to make a living. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is when I am traveling, the buffer isn't large enough to allow for tower hand-off and when you're driving it can get annoying to have your program cut out a lot. Fix that, and I can give it a fifth star."

iHeartRadio,Not for me,Jon,20-Nov-13,1,"The app keeps trying to pigeon hole me into listening to stations I dont want. After two weeks I still haven't found anything I like, and I don't know how to get past all the pop stations. If I wanted to listen to my 3 local pop stations and the local rock station I would turn on my damn radio. I wanted stations from everywhere, I'm sorry but the classic rock station in Texas is the same as the station in New Jersey. I feel that this app is for people who are so glued to their phones they can't be bothered to reach over and turn on the radio.  Hey if you like it that's fine, this app is not for me.  On another note I downloaded Tune-in radio and that app literally solved every problem I had with iHeartRadio in about 2 seconds."

iHeartRadio,"Useful app, but wish it was more attuned to feedback.",Hamburger,26-Aug-13,4,"I love using iHeartRadio on my Kindle to listen to music while I'm in the shower or doing chores around the house. It's nice to be able to listen to my local radio stations and I also enjoy the ""create your own station"" feature. It's cool to be able to hear music I like with the element of surprise you get from radio because you don't know what's coming on next. All with very few commercials.What I don't like is that the ""create your own station"" feature isn't as attuned to feedback as it leads you to believe. When you skip or ""thumbs down"" an artist multiple times, on some stations you never hear that artist again, but on others you'll hear the artist again in a few minutes, and every time you listen to that station."

iHeartRadio,This app sucked. I went online to listen to my favorite ...,CMC,1-Jan-15,1,"This app sucked. I went online to listen to my favorite morning show while I got ready for work. Well that never happened cause apparently I have to sign up for iHeartRadio in order to do this. This has not been the case for many years of my listening enjoyment. Needless to say, I never heard the morning show or anything else, because instead of making myself late for work and wasting time signing up for this crap I got ready in silence and got to work on time. I think it is sad that this is what our world has come to. We can't just enjoy what the internet has to offer without giving our entire identity and personal information so that I can repeatedly receive emails asking ""how are we doing"" on an app I haven't had the time or patients to try to figure out how the stupid thing even works. I deleted this app from my devices since it does me no good and just takes up space."

Unfortunately it only lasts for 2 to 30 seconds.I have tried to get support from iHeart by emailing them at the two addresses, through their support form, and through the public question and answer on their website. However they have not responded a single time.Support is not existent and inadequate. I can't even submit a bug report.1 star for the app, and 1 black hole for support."

This is not what I would call listening to my local station. Also, the in-app ads run over important things during the broadcast at my local radio station. also, if my phone goes into sleep mode the radio cuts off. Overall, this app is very aggravating and I would rather have something better but unfortunately nothing is out there."

iHeartRadio,Would not let me listen,Monica M.,8-Aug-16,1,"I tried to create an account, but it would not let me because they do not service my country (currently on vacation in Turkey). This should not matter if I have an internet connection as the point of this app is to listen to radio over the internet. When my account creation failed, I continued into the app without one. Here I was given a good selection of stations, but the only one I was allowed to listen to was a Russian news station."
iHeartRadio,"Pure streaming, but privacy invasion",Romans 1:16,18-Apr-16,3,"The app is very good as far as connection goes, but issues with privacy. Today, most apps don't charge you, but either gets personal information or relies on you buying in-app items instead. This app allows you to choose any station, by picking a genre, then selecting a station within that genre. All together, it's a great app, but it requires a lot of private info. I would recommend blocking your private info. when this app is installed, which should block information that this app can receive. You can delete the app to get to that information back, and then block and re-install the app. This app requires e-mail, so if you don't have one, create a fake e-mail for ads."

iHeartRadio,Better than...,Kattelak,12-Aug-12,3,"Pandora.  At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition.  While it's great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you wouldn't hear the same stuff within the first half-hour.  Overall? It's a keeper for me for now.  BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes (or at all) unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I'm all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can't find a genre to suit your mood, you're just not looking."
iHeartRadio,i love I heart radio,Margaret J Whitfield,9-Feb-14,5,This is one of the best applications that I have installed.  You can listen to your local radio station or create your own favorite.

iHeartRadio,good but not great,j man,19-Apr-15,4,"I love everything about Iheart but l like to listen to the whole song before I like or dislike the song. Iheart thinks that people like me do not exist so you can not go back to the song you just listened to and like or dislike it. You have to wait for the song to come up again or pray it doesn't and never have to hear it again.  If you don't like or dislike Iheart thinks you liked it or something like that, but everything else is perfect. I would not change anything else about it if you like music, radio, or lyrics strung along in a catchy tone this is the app for you."

iHeartRadio,Say goodbye to satellite radio!,Brian E Farrell,3-Mar-14,5,"I waited in my wife's car while she shopped at a local factory outlet. Bored with radio station choices that were available, I played with my android phone and took advantage of the strong Wi-Fi signal at the outlet. I downloaded the iHeartRadio app and was pleasantly surprised. Music stations that I never heard of from distant locations all over the USA were at my fingertips. Talk readio, Classic Rock stations, Hip Hop, Oldies, Jazz. You name it, you can find it. What a great app!"
iHeartRadio,iheart radio,brianp2003,25-Feb-12,5,This is a great app it has every song that I asked for and it was really easy to use.
iHeartRadio,love iheart!!,me,6-Jan-12,5,this is a great app for the kindle fire. I love it! I have never had any issues with it.
iHeartRadio,Good but have to censor!!!,Amazon Customer,6-Oct-12,2,"My 11 and 5 yr old daughters love Justin Beiber, so I entered that in for the type of music to play.  Our girls can only listen to the app when either my wife or I are present.  Thankfully we have that rule because some song came on with all sorts of profanity, that should not have been included in the Justin Bieber genre.  Dropped Pandora for the same reason.  I don't know why all these artists feel they need to have vulgar lyrics in good songs.  I am as far from ""prude"" as one can imagine, but if there is a chance that kids may hear it, it should not be played on this app."
iHeartRadio,way better then a mp player,Kindle Customer,22-Sep-14,2,I can enter a song from when in high school and find it mostly. My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music.
iHeartRadio,Less cormecials,Amazon Customer,4-Aug-16,5,"Soo far am loving it , less iteration I being with Pandora's for a big while the only thing I use too get frustrated with the iterations here I don't get that, also you guys don't played the same songs over and over!"
iHeartRadio,Creative entertainment,Kindle Customer MAP,8-May-14,4,"Great selection of music! Particular when doing tedious work...add a timer and sleep or awake to iHeart programming of choice. Most important easy to use, always like to leave room for improvement, 41/2 stars."
iHeartRadio,great and no commercials..,Nora,3-May-13,4,I have a Kindle Fire 2nd addition and this app works well.  I listen to it all day in the office and still have 75% - 80% battery life at the end of the day.  Pandora had too many commercials and it drained my Kindle battery in a matter of hours.  Try it!

iHeartRadio,Barely Working,SuncityS,26-Sep-16,1,"It often has a lot of trouble connecting to streams. For example, only 2 of my local stations will even connect. All of them did at first, then they stopped. I contacted the developer and they told me this was a known problem( I'm using a Kindle Fire 7"" 5th generation) and will be fixed in a future update. They haven't done so yet...."
iHeartRadio,NOT THE GREATEST APP,Maggiewood,22-Aug-16,3,"Cannot say I am real happy with iHeart Radio app.  It is not easy to use and searching is a pain.  The desktop version is terrible. I am OK with the mobile version.  But seriously, needs user interface improvements...a lot!  For example, when I search for Bossa Nova music....I get tons of stuff I don't care to listen to and not the right genre."
iHeartRadio,awsome,amarbir bhinder,27-Mar-16,5,It lets me listen to all the songs I like its amazing

iHeartRadio,Doesn't work on new kindle fire HD,Nick,2-Jan-14,1,"Loaded this app, accidentally tapped on a station, then not able to select stations.  Doesn't even play the station selected.  Try to open app and it just flashes for 1/4 sec and disappears.  Deleting app."
iHeartRadio,listen to radio station & play games.,Ruth Rice-Reeves,9-Mar-14,5,Can now listen to my fav radio station and play my games on my kindle.  Before I could only do one or the other.  My kindle won't download the player from Air1 which made me panic cause I was needing my Christian music.  A couple other players that I tried wasn't near as user friendly.  Love that I found it on amazon so I can now do more multi-tasking.  :)
iHeartRadio,I'd like to delete or remove it and restart,Mary Ann Martin,17-Sep-15,1,"even though iheart radio is on my kindle I cannot open it.  It's asking for something I do not know what it is.  Something of a number or something else.  I'd like to delete or remove it and restart, but it doesn't even have delete, remove, or some other button for that.  Very Disappointed. And I wanted to listen to my radio program.  Oh well."
iHeartRadio,I love this app!,aperson,21-Feb-14,5,"I heart radio is an awesome app. You can listen to live radio as well as create your own stations (like Pandora.) It features a sleep timer if you like to listen to music before bed, and an alarm to wake up to. However, if you are like me the music isn't enough to wake me up. You don't even have to be in the app to listen to the music. It is also good for finding new stations. It is completely free, and it's not required to sign in. If you love music as much as I do you should get this app."
iHeartRadio,wonderful,Kindle Customer,10-Feb-14,5,"I love this app it's great and has all my favorites. I can listen to 80's, hits, country , anything I want. And unlike Pandora no commercials unless it's live radio lol and u pick what u like."
iHeartRadio,I heart iHeartRadio!,Babbzilla,21-Feb-13,5,"This is the ONLY way I can listen to my favorite radio station Elvis Duran and The Morning Show!  Without it, I'd be lost!!!!"
iHeartRadio,I love the music choices.,Kindle Customer,15-Mar-17,5,I like that I can pick out an artist and hear otrher artists from the same genre that I might not have thought about wanting to hear. I think there is more variety in music from a station I have selected than other apps.
iHeartRadio,usless to me,michael v,7-Oct-16,1,will not play on my kindle fire.
iHeartRadio,Best update radio to listen to.,heather,30-May-16,5,I love this radio station because it has so many choices to choose from and you can even build your own station by adding your own music. It has no  intermission  during music and all the lastest music and DJS can be found  on it .Well deserved rate.
iHeartRadio,Hello IHeart Radio - Goodbye Pandora,Jeff,14-Jun-13,5,"I listen to music everywhere, and all day long. When Pandora reduced free listening to 40 hrs a month I started looking for a replacement, and found one with IHeart radio.I have this app rocking on all my gadgets now (PC, tablet, ipod).The 'custom' personalized station function setting is very easy to use and the selection of artist-related songs is great.I rate songs while listening so IHeart radio learns to play more of the tunes I like. Also important is giving a 'Thumbs Down' to songs I don't want in the mix.So far I haven't heard any sound lag/buffering or annoying ads (Pandora has gotten bad with this in my experience).IHeart radio is highly recommended. Great accessibility, easy set-up and use, and unlimited FREE listening."
iHeartRadio,One Star,El Gordo,24-Sep-16,1,It's not working right now.
iHeartRadio,LOVE IT!,GiGi Kawasaki,6-Sep-12,5,I <3 my radio!!!!!! It's easy to use and the quality of sound is crystal clear. I can listen as I do other activities on my kindlefire. I'm in love with iheartradio!!!!!

iHeartRadio,Would not connect half the time,Michael,10-May-17,2,"Selected stations outside of my market area and it just sat there and spun, but didn't connect.  I will try again, but Amazon music is better."
iHeartRadio,I no longer like this app.,Walk'n and Talk'n Classes,11-Mar-15,1,"It worked for awhile but now when the talk shows I listen to go to a commercial iheart takes over with ENDLESS music and ads causing me to miss my desired show/program.  I end up stopping iheart, restarting it again so I can listen to my programs (plural) until it goes to a break and iheart takes over again with ENDLESS ads and music.  I am searching for a replacement app."
iHeartRadio,Great,Nicholas Stover,6-Sep-13,5,"It works perfectly, you need a face book if you want your stations, if you don't like that then get over it and don't download the app. It's reasonable for them to request Facebook because it helps keep the app free because they don't have to host the login and always makes the app faster."
iHeartRadio,So much better then Pandora.,FonzGorilla,28-Sep-13,5,Its so much better then Pandora cause it gets what you want to listen to.It pays attention to the music you like.In Pandora you give a song a thumbs down but it plays the same song or artist over and over again.iHeartRadio gives you more variety to most familiar to least familiar.its awesome.When this review says Bree Fontinilla that's my mum.I'm her daughter writing this review.Zoe Kemp.Also known as Zoe Horan - Styles.Youtube channel- ZoeHoran1213.Plez subscribe to me.I haven't made any videos yet.

iHeartRadio,I Might Hate IHeartRadio,Maureen,21-May-16,1,"I signed up. I connected IHeartRadio to my Alexa / Echo added the IHeartRadio app to my Kindle Fire, listened to part of a few songs  on the Fire. Then I told Alexa to play IHeartRadio and listened to about 7 minutes straight  of commercials. I listen to Sirius XM in the car and change the station when commercials come on. Perhaps I will try it again. Alexa suggested IHeartRadio when I was trying to listen to something on Amazon  Prime that I did not have in my library."
iHeartRadio,Many Problems For Me,duckyman341,29-Oct-16,1,I want to listen to a bands radio station but half the time I get songs from a different band. Also when I went to make my own station I though I got to choose the songs but if I click a song it adds that whole songs station with other music that's not that song. I like spotify better
iHeartRadio,"Love , love, love ! <3",Hunter&amp;Mikayla,5-Jul-14,5,"I LOVE iHeartRadio ! It's so much better pandora, doesn't have any ads that interrupt your music playing like pandora. When you create your own playlist and you like certain songs, it starts to play songs more like it and not random stuff. Plus, you can listen to the radio or like I said before, create your own playlist that has no commercials ! It's so great and convenient. I suggest you to GET THIS APP. Thanks for reading, much appreciated. :) Enjoy your jammin' !"
iHeartRadio,4.5 out of 5 stars for iHeart Radio,Kawaii Potato~,29-Sep-13,4,Overall a good app. It's got good songs and bands and is good if you like certain bands but don't want to actually buy the CD. The only complaint I have is that you have a moment ad to how many songs you can skip in a playlist a day. Also you can't add individual songs to your playlist. But a good app. I enjoy it.
iHeartRadio,Wonderful,Mercy,16-Aug-13,5,"great music and news.  variety, accessibility.  now can listen to it at work without a problem.keep the good work"

iHeartRadio,Still needs bug fixes,Chiaroscuro,1-Aug-16,2,"They're trying to patch it. Still get random ""IHeart Radio is not working"" error messages even when the app is off. Lots of interruptions in streaming (but may be due to slow wifi where I use it). It use to work much better before they ""improved"" it."
iHeartRadio,Unhappy and I'm annoyed,D.G,1-Aug-12,1,Right after I downloaded it I deleted it because it skipped and you have to have an Internet connection to listen. I had heard that it was a good app but it is not worth getting. I also had a hard time using the app. I would much rather continue using Pandora and VeVo like I usually do. I reccomend that you don't get this app.
iHeartRadio,Just Wasn't For Me,liz phil,26-Mar-15,2,I thought I could like this app but just couldn't take the time too. Some people might think its awesome and that's okay.
iHeartRadio,love it,shiloh2000,17-Mar-12,5,this app is free and awesome. the catch is you have to have internet connection on some of your stations to get it to work.
iHeartRadio,not hearting it!,debbi,11-Aug-13,2,"After using only 4 ""thumbs down"" options I was cut off from making any other song choices other than being allowed to skip to next song. It also took some time to load today. I waited 7 minutes, retried and then finally gave up. I loved it when it was working, but got really frustrated with the rest. I will keep at and see if I can't find harmony with it somehow!"
iHeartRadio,SUCKS,kevin barker,24-Feb-15,1,"They upgraded iHeartRadio and it sucks! The new version is worse than the old version. They should have just stuck with the old version. The new one always pauses,  then says the application isn't responding then asks you to force close the application. But whatever,  I'm not telling you what to do. Choice is yours."

It's nice to hear new music and not be stuck with all the same songs on my ipod (you do get sick of them after awhile!) I also enjoy hearing the personalities I recognize and listening to news from home. Of all the apps I've purchased, this is one I use everyday!"
iHeartRadio,I Heart IHeartRadio,Cherryreads,13-Mar-13,5,I listen to this app everyday.  I have it both on my android phone and my Kindle Fire.  I love being able to listen to most of the local stations out of the car while I'm waiting for an appointment or grocery shopping.  I also listen to a few national stations as well.  It's also nice to be able to listen to your local station while on vacation away from home.
iHeartRadio,awesome!,liv,10-Jun-12,5,"to all you stupid people who don't know how to read, you don't have to have a facebook account for this app its says you can create an account through facebook OR your email. so if you don't have a facebook account you can still use this app. I love it so much because you can listen to any radio station you want anywhere in the world you are.. its ammaazziinnggg!"
iHeartRadio,Great Music,delovinganimeandmanga,26-Nov-16,4,"I love this app, it would be great if I could listen to foreign music, like Korea pop, on this app as well. There is also an issue with the sound on the kindle, it keeps going out while the music continues to play."
iHeartRadio,If I Lived in New York City...,Robert Hypes,21-Dec-12,1,"Every channel I tried to  pick just kept taking me back to New York City area stations. I don't live anywhere near NYC and wanted some of the stations nearer to my location that I can't pick up over the airwaves.Not at all user friendly from what I could tell, so I deleted it. I don't have time for apps that don't work the way I want them to work."
iHeartRadio,never,ranger,17-Nov-14,1,"People lied to me, said I could use this app without singing in to Facebook or e-mail, well I tried and all I could get to work was 2 radio stations, I don't like either, so I deleted the app. I get much better with Pandora even with commercials. This app sucks,making you have to sing up for music I don't even like."
iHeartRadio,Love listening to am radio,Mame,30-Apr-14,5,Except iHeart stops all of a sudden in the middle of my favorite program and sometimes refuses to work again.  I hate this!!

I do not listen to music.
iHeartRadio,Meh...,ButterflyPinlk,31-Dec-16,2,"It's good, except when it says ""it's all new with unlimited skips and it can go offline"". This crap, is fake. I can't have unlimited skips or can't update so I can. This is the one of many things wrong with this app."

iHeartRadio,Mood Music,Stannie,15-Aug-12,5,"The music played always seems to fit what ever I'm doing if I've had a bad day at work I tune in to I heart radio. Hey I start looseing stress, (if you know what I mean) If I'm in a 60's mood I tune into some jams I haven't heard since I was a little girl. Oh and when I'm in that romantic mood look out just tune on in to the slow and sexy. Really it is a great app.Truely Yours,Stannie"
iHeartRadio,good.,awesome!,22-Dec-14,4,It's alright. Better than Pandora. I find it very helpful when choosing my favorite artists to listen too. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to discover new music and without the hassle of buying all them when you can just listen to it without paying. Then if you really like it you can buy it.

iHeartRadio,The Kindle app is a bit frustrating,Rincewind,28-Sep-13,1,"I have this on my phone and I don't have problems. I like to use it on my Kindle too, but once it is launched and playing I cannot get the app back up. Music plays but the screen is blank. At first I thought it was because I had used another app and tried to come back to it, which seemed logical if a bit 2009. However it doesn't really matter, once the music is started the only way for it to stop is when it times out or I shut my kindle all the way down. No liking or disliking songs, no changing stations, or even knowing who the current artist is. Is anyone having problems like this? I make do but I'd love an update to fix this.The good news is it is stuck on a custom station made from my favorite band. That's something at least."
iHeartRadio,I Heart Radio,Bob Stafford,11-Jun-12,5,As a former radio DJ for many years I enjoy listening and sampling stations around the country. I Heart Radio on my Kindle Fire - which I love - allows me to do that. If you like to listen and read or play Words with Friends at the same time I Heart Radio is a must have.Bob Stafford
iHeartRadio,Satisfied,Dan Keating,8-Jan-17,5,It's about time I found a music app that really works and really satisfies. No kidding-I am a vinyl collector and song writer and this app does the trick. Muchas Gracias.Spaceba. Domo Arigato Gozimus. Danke. Graci. Blagodaria. Kob Kune Krahp. Shea Shae.
iHeartRadio,Love this!,AuthorRyanSchneider,17-Dec-13,5,I had to find a new radio app when my old station got bitchy with their licensing bulls*** and I couldn't listen to them on TuneIn Radio anymore. So I found IHeartRadio and it works awesome. Use it pretty much every day on my 1st gen Kindle Fire while I'm working out. Plays in the background while I use a timer app to do 1-min HIIT rounds of weightlifting.
iHeartRadio,Not as good as could be. But okay.,Tom Servo and Crow,7-Sep-13,2,"I have set up several of my own ""stations"" but have not been real happy with the repetitiveness of certain songs. Seems like it focuses on just a couple of the artist's songs and replays them fairly often without digging deeper into the catalog. I wish it had more features and that the streaming rate could be checked. Also, a record button would be nice."
iHeartRadio,One Star,piscesmonkeygirl,10-Sep-17,1,app didn't work.

iHeartRadio,"Was great, key word being was",horsegirl4655,20-Nov-13,2,"Being abroad Pandora doesn't work on my Kindle so I could listen to a radio station from home when I went to bed. 1) said station NEVER worked so I found another station. 2) it used to play after I shut the kindle's screen off, now it stops.  The whole point of downloading was so I could listen to a radio station from home and feel close to home."
iHeartRadio,Help w/download,Amazon Customer,19-Feb-17,1,I have had this app before (from Google Playstore) but uninstalled to free up memory.

iHeartRadio,More like iHeartBuffering,Andrew Brandt,6-Jan-13,2,"My favorite radio station out of Dallas, went to this app, so I downloaded it to listen. Constantly buffers. Hiccups in audio all the time. Very unhappy, as I used to listen to the station on the TuneIn app with no problem. Hopefully ClearChannel gets their servers situated, or they are going to lose lots of listeners to other formats."

iHeartRadio,LOL,Kjmlucero,8-Aug-12,4,"I love this app! It's introduced me to a lot of music and artists that I wouldn't have listen to otherwise.

iHeartRadio,Great App and Free,Designer,19-Aug-16,5,"I would recommend this App for people that don't want to pay through the nose for XM radio and listen to their favorite stations including those with political or religious views. I want to admit to you that you can use this App on any Android or iPhone device, but beware it also uses your minutes as well, well worth it. Right now I have it connected to two of my devices, the Android phone and my Amazon Fire."

I'm sure there is a way to get there but I don't know what it is. It wants to connect through my faceboook which I won't allow so that may be why it does not work as I think it should.

OR NOT!!!!!!!Can't recommend it."
iHeartRadio,iHeart or Pandora?,Kindle Customer,19-Aug-12,5,"iHeart or Pandora? I know it's hard to choose so here's a small summery.  iheart radio has many stations based on genre, where you want to hear it from, and you can create your own stations with commercial free included and Pandora has all that but you have to pay $5.00 and skips too. Now you decide."
iHeartRadio,best music app ever,Arlo Ashton,3-May-14,4,"I love this app, you can listen to free music and the music doesn't take up any space!

iHeartRadio,Kind of Hard to Figure Out,Deborah G Everly,5-Apr-13,3,"I am pretty tech savy, however, I found this hard to figure out.  Of course I like things I can just get into and start running with.  This is not one of those.  I am gong to have to sit with it to figure it out."
iHeartRadio,Good app,BigDogatPlay,15-Aug-13,4,I enjoy being able to listen to a variety of sources from around the country and across formats. Would like to see more oldies stations (that don't consider the 80's to be the limit of oldies) but that's the service provider not the app.
iHeartRadio,ILoveIHeartRadio,Timothy Geary,19-Aug-13,5,IHeartRadio has got to be one of the best apps ever!!!  No where else do you have a variety of music in the palm of your hand.  I enjoy the stations and the personalities.
iHeartRadio,unable to download,jack j,19-Aug-13,1,This is very bad customer support. I have to deal with a lot of irrllevant crape posted and no way to get the software kn Mg kindle.Let J's stick with the rellevance of downloading. A simple download button would be great.
iHeartRadio,"Another app with new, unjustified permissions requests",Amazon Customer,26-Jan-14,2,"No explanation of why it needs all of these new permissions (information about my Wi-Fi network, for example.) Uninstalled. No matter how well an app works, unless the dev (or Amazon) starts explaining the need for all of these new permissions, I will continue to rate low and/or uninstall completely."

iHeartRadio,Soft Melodies To Hard Rock![;,mika ale,11-Jun-12,5,"This is probably the best music app! Pandora has way too many commercials and Songza is very buggy.

iHeartRadio,Best app ever,Amazon Customer,26-Jul-16,5,This music app is awesome I love it whoever made this app thank you you made life better _Ÿ˜†_Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜_
iHeartRadio,Don't forget your password,D. Westerburg,5-Aug-12,5,"This is a great app!  You can listen to the top stations in the country and even create your own.

iHeartRadio,IHeart should be so much better than it is.,Ted M.,18-Jan-17,3,This app just doesn't play as smoothly as it should..Sometimes my shows won't load..I should be able to pick up where I left off of a show. Screen off drops are a pain in the ass..
iHeartRadio,"Good App, Multiple Choices",T. F. Severance,18-Aug-13,4,"This is a good app with multiple choices.  What I don't like is the constant commercials from the stations to which I listen.  Tedious and repetitive commercials, especially for IHeart radio..which I am already listening to!"
iHeartRadio,iheart radio,Debbie,19-Aug-13,5,"I can listen to music on my phone, computer or kindle fire. That is what like about this product. I like that I can choose the stations I want to listen to."
iHeartRadio,JUST OK,Amazon Customer,15-Aug-13,3,"Most radio apps are just ok. This is better than many but still doesn't allow real flexibility. If one could be designed with the best features of many like CNN, ESPN, FOX SPORTS, HLN etc it would be worth paying for it."
iHeartRadio,awsome!!!,Kayla,5-Dec-14,5,Hey when the other reviews are all have good ratings it's gotta be good. I mean they make it simple and easy to use.

iHeartRadio,Pleasantly Surprised,Amazon Customer,10-Jun-17,4,"I have obscure tastes in punk and I was surprised they had a large volume and variety of bands that I could hardly find albums for in a record shop circa the early 80's. Also have a great selection of jazz, folk, blues and indie."
iHeartRadio,Music to Your Ears,Amazon Customer,2-Sep-13,4,"iHeartRadio is a great app.  The only problem I have with it is that it tends to crash.  It has a variety of different stations that you can listen to, each of which have an array of different genres and songs.  Overall, I'm satisfied with it and give it my recommendation."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio,Gtucke277,7-Jan-14,4,This is a very refreshing version from Pandora.  I love the fact that you can select the stations based on the state you are in and listen to music that is commercial free.  All my favorite artist by categories or station.

iHeartRadio,Works overseas.,Don Rowberg,4-Aug-17,3,"I live in Tanzania. None of the other U.S. music sites that I know of permit me to use them here. I Heart Radio does so that is great, but there are frequent pauses in their service. Maybe due to buffering?"

iHeartRadio,Android should be universally installable,Wendell Sessions,3-Aug-14,1,"I have many android devices. I am not happy, because I cannot install it on all of them.

iHeartRadio,good,R. E.,3-Mar-15,4,"Look it's really good, I mean it has a big selection of music. But it needs to fix some stuff, when I want to hear a certain group I should be able to listen to them without having some random group pop up. But in all it's a good app."
iHeartRadio,Susupicious,anonymous,7-Aug-12,1,This is very strange I never wrote a review for this app but apparently it made a 5 star review for itself (now I've edited it). I've never even used this app but now it's suspicious.

iHeartRadio,I wanted a radio app that I could listen to the news from all over the US and other countries and not just music.,Linda A. Hammons,1-Jan-14,1,I subscribe to Pandora for music.  This app was disappointing because it keeps asking you to log on to Facebook and asks for personal information that I do not care to provide.
iHeartRadio,fun af,Kindle Customer,3-Mar-15,5,"Love, better than wack Pandora radio _Ÿ˜•"
iHeartRadio,Two Stars,Clockwork,6-Jul-14,2,OK app but not as good as Pandora or spotify

iHeartRadio,One Star,Carol,29-Nov-14,1,It would not download on my Kindle.
iHeartRadio,I love that amazon has apps to download,LuvMyAmazon,2-Mar-16,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download. The  apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"
iHeartRadio,I can't open it,kimberly Davis,7-Aug-12,1,I had this app for about a month now. It was great at first but then I uninstalled it and I can't installed it again. I tried going to the app store and it shows an open button I press on that button but it doesn't. do anything. Please help!!
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,ACMF-Patrick,5-Dec-14,5,i would buy it again

iHeartRadio,iheartradio,tina g,2-Sep-12,5,This is a great connection for music in anytown as well as state. Simply get on and pick what city you would like to hear music ppl in that city get to hear. It also saves your favorate stations that you have found while browsing the site. By the way its free.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Pam Nugent,3-Mar-15,5,Neat :)

iHeartRadio,Three Stars,w.d,8-Dec-14,3,ok
iHeartRadio,Three Stars,A. Taylor,4-Dec-14,3,OK
iHeartRadio,Four Stars: Please read information below,Lyndah Ghostbear,24-Apr-17,4,"Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there's no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it'll automatically choose songs or stations to play next. It'll also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can't like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can't save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist.  This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you don't like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that's the truth. I'm here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...There's nothing really to expose."
iHeartRadio,sucks!!!,Michele,24-Aug-13,1,"I love music but when I get a song in my head, I want to hear that song. I dont mind hearing similar songs by the same or similar artists AFTER I hear the one I want.  I cant figure out how to do that. Then when I skip too many times it locks me out. I hate this app."
iHeartRadio,Must Read !!!,Rich  U,6-Sep-12,4,"Excellent app to listen to so many different types fromcomedy to rock and anything in between.Excellent app and I recommend it to all.This will be excellent until there is a charge to use it.I would suggest to all that if and when you have to pay forthis... call or write and complain.Right now, remains an excellent that all should have.Rich"

iHeartRadio,yawn,pokemaster12149,1-Feb-12,1,this app is one of my least favorite apps ever. it has none of the songs I like or stations. just tryed it. Pandora is better. dials there axway to remove my account?
iHeartRadio,why facebook seriously? :(,Myranda Reyna,16-May-12,1,"first of all I had gotten the I <3 radio. then when I tried to get a station, it said I needed a facebook or to log in. I do not have a facebook and its just very horrible. PEOPLE GET THE PANDORA APP!!!!! you need it and it dosent need facebook"
iHeartRadio,Battery sucker...,rlauer6@comcast.net,20-Jun-13,2,Interesting application with access to lots of stations.  Problem for me was it sucked up my battery life pretty fast.  Recommended if you remember to turn it off.
iHeartRadio,didnt have stations from my state,Susan Kelly,12-May-12,1,the app sounded cool until I went to pick a station to listen to and there were none from my state. cant really listen to the radio without stations
iHeartRadio,love this app,Arley,8-Dec-12,5,You don't need a facebook account. When it ask to sign in you just hit maybe later. Love this becasuse I can listen to the radio stations I listen to in my car.
iHeartRadio,Love the iHeart Radio App,Ruth,29-Aug-13,5,Downloaded this great Free App to listen to music & other audio when away from home radio or computer.  I love that I can carry my favorite music & radio shows all over my home & outside too.  Never have to miss any part of song or show.
iHeartRadio,Requires F-book (Facebook),MK,30-Apr-12,1,"Didn't even download, as soon as I saw it REQUIRED F-Book (Facebook).I don't care if they gave me $10,000 to download, if it involves F-Book, Forget it!!!"
iHeartRadio,Won't install on Kindle Fire,D. Jones,10-Jan-12,1,Evidently needs modification for Fire. Tapping install button does nothing. tried rebootng Fire; still won't respond. Perhaps there's something I don't know?
iHeartRadio,clear channel contributes to Rush Limbaugh Racist network,Robert Wolfe,4-Jan-14,1,"any questions?  Rush is the drug addicted, lying, feel good for the conservative bible thumping racist network called Fox.  Rush sucks so bad Fox will not hire him, yet they hird and fired the self professed Mormon with the white hair.  dont buy this."
iHeartRadio,i am disappointed,biskits,22-Feb-13,1,I can't even listen to it because the stations keep cutting out every few seconds.  Not at all a pleasurable experience
iHeartRadio,I heart this app!,LSmith,5-Dec-12,5,"I love so many features about this app.  The custom radio stations one can build are excellent.  Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.  This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.  Thank you for making this available"
iHeartRadio,I LOVE IT?!,Trishelle Wesney,27-Feb-16,5,It helps me relax and listen to fnaf music and u get to add ur stations

iHeartRadio,Love It! Summertime Fun!,Amazon Customer,5-Jul-16,5,I've long enjoyed listening to iHeart Radio in the car and that's where I heard the ad for the app! I love my tablet and it's great to have so many stations at your disposal. Thumbs up or down feature and u can always scan to another station if you don't like song. Mark the stations you like by clicking the heart icon. You've just created your own personalized favorite stations list that can keep evolving as you. Choose your favorite genres of music and enjoy!

iHeartRadio,Tedious,David C. Stokes,19-Apr-12,1,Tedious log in process turns the User off right away. They are trying to force you to use Facebook. Boycott this app.
iHeartRadio,Don't support hate speech,Jeremy D Land,8-Mar-14,1,"I struggled with the decision to install this app, but I feel it is important to inform people.Clear Channel supports right-wing hate- and fear-monger Rush Limbaugh. Using their apps gives the implication that you approve of how they spend money from their ad revenue."
iHeartRadio,THIS APP SUCKS!!!!,Smexy ferret,28-Apr-12,1,NEVER get this app cuz it SUCKS! !!!! U have to have fb and I don't havva fb so it doesn't work. poop on Iheartradio! get Pandora instead! Pandora rules!!!!

iHeartRadio,So far so good - no complaints!,Wabbit,8-Jan-12,5,"other than my hillbilly Internet service causing lags, I have no complaints w/this app - & my overpriced, under-performing ISP has nothing to do w/this awesome app! Highly recommended!"
iHeartRadio,Great App,Pam Freeland,13-Feb-16,4,I wish it would play the song that you type in when you start rather than other music but other than that I really appreciate this app.

iHeartRadio,TIMELINE,Schwarzenegger,23-Apr-12,1,"This was a good app, unroll that. But they make you have timeline on Facebook! that's really not fair! I HATE TIMELINE!!!!!"
iHeartRadio,EPIC FAIL!,Alex R.,5-Mar-12,1,To me this is the weakest app I have ever had in my life! Don't mean to be rude to the creators but this app is weak!
iHeartRadio,constant force close,Ponch,8-Feb-12,1,App will not run on my fascinate without access to GPS and external storage. It is also very annoying that you can't bypass the sign in and location screens. Every time the app is launched you have to go through the process of declining. It would be nice to have a checkbox to not show up again. I will be uninstalling after this review.
iHeartRadio,i heart radio :),bookworm28,2-Sep-12,5,"well,  this is a cool app. I can listen to my favorite stations even when I am at a different state. think that's is cool and it is also nice when I go to college soon"
iHeartRadio,love it,Kayla Q.,24-Aug-13,5,This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
iHeartRadio,great app,great game,26-Mar-16,5,NOTHING like a radio when you don't have one.  A radio that plays the music you like.  If a song comes on you don't like click dislike it won't play it again.
iHeartRadio,terrible,Greenie,28-Jul-12,1,this crashes everytime I try to play a station ill stick with Pandora not worth the download don't waste time
iHeartRadio,iHeart Radio,Brandy Murrell,1-Sep-13,5,Love it! I could listen to any station anywhere. Even if you are not in the same state! You can find any music that you like to listen to.
iHeartRadio,I like Pandora Better,MKRay,3-Sep-13,1,It is a good app don't get me wrong.  I just feel that pandora is easier to use.  I couldn't figure out how to switch channels on this one.  I tried and tried but ...Nothing.  I hear a lot of good things about IHeart Radio but unfortunately..I don't Heart it.
iHeartRadio,awesomeness,Tuty,21-Aug-13,5,I listen to it all the time. I like that i can listen to any type of music if desire.
iHeartRadio,"For an old timer, it is amazing.",jabnolimit,18-Jul-16,5,"It's nice but I wish there was some instructions either on the app or on line.  I put a station into my favorites and cannot figure how to get rid of it  I went on line and asked I heart radio how to do it, but it has been at least 5 days, so I guess I am not going to get an answer.  But in general it is very nice."
iHeartRadio,awesome,Denelle,1-Sep-12,5,i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it u should to i hope u do anyway i am denelle aka wolftail so get the hunger ganes or the last hope if u want to chat

iHeartRadio,love it,roxie,3-Sep-12,5,love it. it is easy to listen too and you can pick a radio station or make one i like this. everyone should try it.
iHeartRadio,"Great app, but I wonder, do artists get a fair shake?",UncleBobMartin,12-Apr-17,5,"Somehow, I feel a bit better about this than Spotify. Whichever app you choose, you have to wonder if it's good for artists. Playing music pays well, for those at the top, but there's a lot of strugglers, and these ""all you can eat for free"" options are worrisome. But in terms of what you get, I Heart is terrific for consumers of music -- and the better you know the tunes & artists, the more mileage you'll get."
iHeartRadio,use email address to sign in,Avid Cyclist,3-Sep-12,5,don't need Facebook anymore to sign in. sign up with your email address. I have listenen to app w/o FB
iHeartRadio,Works for me,Julia Reeves,6-Sep-12,5,The times I have used iHeartRadio it was been awesome.  Love that you can pick an artist and make your own playlist.  Thank you for making the app.
iHeartRadio,I heart!,Troy Grate,6-Aug-17,4,Pretty good app. Easy for anyone to use & very good audio quality.
iHeartRadio,I don't want to belimited to someone's preselected music,Sri Ahimsa,1-Jan-14,1,I loaded this thinking I could listen to more than the top xxx pieces of music. There is so much more but it wasn't made obvious how to get to other stations. If I have to slog to find what I want I take that as a clue I have taken the wrong direction. I removed this from my Kindle and the Cloud after a frustrating hour of trying to get it do what it implied.
iHeartRadio,awesome,C Barber,3-Sep-12,5,this app is awesome because it plays what's on the radio if you don't have one. get this app asap.
iHeartRadio,Great radio for Kindle!,Kim Conlin,22-Aug-13,5,I love this app! The music is so great and the ability to make your own customized station is awesome. So glad this is a Kindle app!
iHeartRadio,iheartradio,Hazel Jordon,20-Jun-13,1,I could not get a good station on the radio and it was even harder to stop playing your selection of mucis.  Not good at all.
iHeartRadio,declined agreement due to fees,Meg,6-Oct-13,1,"Make sure after downloading this app or any other.  This app has a section in the agreement called ""fees"" where it clearly states that although this app is free now,  it reserves the right to charge us fees in the future.  Although (I would hope) there would be a notification before it charges the fee, I don't want to have to deal with any hidden charges."
iHeartRadio,Haven't use,Dorothy  RIchardson,7-Dec-13,4,"I actually have never used this, forgot I had it and don'tthink to try it while on the computer so I can't really leavea review."
iHeartRadio,Such a Great Way to Hear My Favorite Shows,Victoria's Bookshelf,14-Aug-13,5,Easy to use and great programs. I will recommend this to all my friends and family. IHeartRadio is terrific. Thanks
iHeartRadio,"i bought this app, only to find out that when i log in with facebook, it doesn't work. it just tells you on how to set it up",Kenzie,23-Feb-12,1,"I bought this app only to find out when you log in with facebook, it only tells you how to do it, their was no continue button.

iHeartRadio,Hard to use...,Amazon Customer,29-Apr-14,1,Hated it ...could not figure it out. ..like how to delete chanels I did not like...and how to turn it compleatly off..It kept draining my battery. ..
iHeartRadio,not working,Randall Mentink,30-Apr-14,1,It will not work on my kindle fire. I do have it on my phone and use it regularity.  The rating on using IHeartRadio through my phone is 4 stars.
iHeartRadio,temporarily blocked the app store,Ed Fetters,9-May-12,1,So i got iheartradio and the next day it made my kindle fire not work at the app store but it works now. Don't buy it. Works great otherwise.
iHeartRadio,I hate radio,Amazon Customer,5-Sep-13,1,Wasted to hear one game on my local radio. No go. I hate radio. Worthless. Oh for a good radio antenna.
iHeartRadio,Sucked a**,carissa jungen,15-Jan-14,1,Kept freezing and never worked. I liked iheart on my phone but on the kindle it did not work it kept saying the program stopped working and would cut back to home. So stupid this would be why I like pandora more
iHeartRadio,facebook account!,n.a.p,26-Dec-11,1,I personly choose not to have a facebook  because its over rated. and there's not even an option to have a non-related facebook account. I give this app a thumbs down. Pandora's better than this
iHeartRadio,Amazing,jessica,6-May-14,1,Amazon is amazing I can get better things on there for my bunny then I can get at pet smart it rocks _Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜çI am In love with it
iHeartRadio,Great app with one exception,Catlady,29-Dec-16,4,"Wonderful station, with one exception that I'll get to in a bit.Lots of stations from my local area stations to decade specific genre stations.  I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore.  Very few ads really, just occasionally when I change stations.  Limited number of skips available per day, but meh, just change the station if you really can't stand that song.Now for the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  This is an older version 5.  The newer version 7 allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated.  This version is buggy or it just doesn't work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire.  The version 7 app from Google Play loads fine on my tablet and smartphone for that station, just not this version for Kindle Fire."
iHeartRadio,I wouldn't recamend it,terrible,25-Jan-12,1,It did not download like it was supposed to.Don't get me wrong because it probably does work fine just it won't download!
iHeartRadio,Best ever!,JenSev,3-Jun-16,5,Have been with my sister in the hospital for the last two weeks who suffers from Early Onset Alzheimer's. TV is no longer of interest but music is very much still a part of her entertainment- an incredible calming effect. This has been a godsend for 14 days straight. No commercials is fabulous too!  Thank you.  Favorite station turned out to be Sunny Radio.
iHeartRadio,use,Audrey Aldous,18-Jan-14,1,"I never use this app, so I really cant say how it is. I had never heard of it before coming here tho."

iHeartRadio,Didn't have any use for it...,Gigi111,23-May-14,1,"To be completely honest, I downloaded this free app to get the coins that came with it.  I didn't even try it out."
iHeartRadio,"Ugh, nothing but ClearChannel",andrea muro,19-Jun-14,1,Why would I want my radio listening limited to corporate giants and all their boring stations? Exactly. I don't. :-(
iHeartRadio,Love it!,Danielle,24-Aug-13,5,I love this app! I can listen to radio stations from all over the country. This app allows you to set the alarm to your favorite radio station so you don't have to wake up to that annoying buzzer. I highly recommend it!
iHeartRadio,Didn't work and kept crashing,Russ Smith,7-Jan-14,1,"I use iHeart Radio on my laptop and had used it on my Blackberry.  On my Android, it crashed repeatedly."
iHeartRadio,pretty good,A. Holyfield,8-Sep-12,4,"this is a pretty good app. don't listen to the people who say you need facebook, it's not true. you can sign in with facebook or email, but that's only if you want to save stations or make your custom station. you can still listen to the radio without facebook or email."
iHeartRadio,works great,xPinkiePiex,20-Jun-13,5,I have the desktop version also the kindle and phone app. Never had a problem and I love the live stations as well as picking my own stations to listen too.

iHeartRadio,My favorite radio streaming tool,DTRW,2-Jun-16,4,"My favorite radio streaming tool.  Has features like pandora where you create a station, and it also lets you stream real radio stations."
iHeartRadio,"Fantastic, and Much Better than Pandora!",Alison G.,24-Aug-15,5,"I was told to try iHeart Radio once Pandora started being a butthead. While Pandora is great, it started randomly shutting off on my phone, can take forever to load one song, or have an ad literally every other song. So I tried iHeart Radio. Why not? It's free. And man, am I glad I did! You can make your own station just from saying what one song you like, which is what I wanted, and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song, so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get an ad when you first start your app, and then it plays smooth and as long as you want! I think my favorite part is that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have an Android phone, so I can't say that it happens on Windows or Apple products, but I love just having to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It saves me a button press, and lets me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app is I can't listen to stand up comedians, and I can't figure out how to make a Broadway Musicals station. For those, I'm stuck with Pandora, but I can deal with that. I don't listen to musicals and comedians as much, now that I have iHeart Radio anyway. It has only randomly shut down once, but it was playing for three hours straight, so I didn't think it was an app problem. It's smooth, doesn't take long to load, and offers lyrics for nearly every song!"
iHeartRadio,love it,Missyb,15-Aug-13,5,"I love all the radio stations.  Especially, the ones with uninterrupted music.  Better than XM radio and you don't have to pay."
iHeartRadio,Great app and the execution so far has been flawless.,Brent Olson,15-Aug-13,5,So far this streaming radio app has performed flawlessly for me.  Unlike other apps that perform on occasion this app has been reliable and I appreciate the variety of genres available.  Love it!
iHeartRadio,Wouldn't work on my Fire HD,charles adams,17-Feb-13,1,Downloaded to my Fire HD and tried to open. Received a message window that Iheart radio stopped running. Tried to open several times with the same results. Deleted the app from the device and cloud and downloaded again. Same results. So I deleted again and won't bother.
iHeartRadio,Droid Charge force close!,J. Mixon,3-Dec-11,1,I have a droid charge and this app will never work. Every time I tried to search for station it force closed!
iHeartRadio,Major Bug Problem,BMcLagan,25-Jul-12,1,"Every time I tryed to open it the "" iheartradio is not responding force close"" thingDO NOT GET IT HAS MAJOR BUG PROBLEMS"

iHeartRadio,FAILED COMPLETELY!,TropicalCbreeze,28-Aug-16,1,A HAS BEEN ! Too bad this app failed completely and will no longer open. NO possibility of even updating app is available at all. What a miserable failure. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.
iHeartRadio,IHeart IHeartRadio,Margaret patrick,22-Aug-13,5,"We were so frustrated with the poor radio reception in our area at night.  Then IHeartRadio came along and we are thrilled.  We listen to Melbourne FL, Birmingham AL and Providence RI and reception is great."

iHeartRadio,Now I listen!,Richard,16-Aug-13,5,"Love the variety of programing available and now listen to my Kindle far more than before.  With the addition of a mini-external speaker to my Kindle, it is a joy!"
iHeartRadio,Great app,S. Striker,20-Aug-13,5,Love having Iheart on my Kindle fire and phone. I like being able to get K-Love in the bathroom when I'm getting ready for work. I haven't played with it tons because I mostly listen to Christian stations but I love having the options it gives me
iHeartRadio,Facebook account not required,vantiene phothong,10-Apr-13,5,"Facebook account not required, it is an option. It allows you to create your own account unrelated to facebook. I created a new account and am able to save my favorite stations and playlists. I love the updates: alarm clock and sleep function. When I travel, I like the ability to listen to my home radio stations. Great app!"
iHeartRadio,You create your own station,CJC,23-Aug-13,5,"Imagine not having to change a channel, you choose your favorite artists and genre and ittakes it from there.  Love it!"
iHeartRadio,I love IheartRadio. I recently had to reset my first ...,Wade Staggs,25-Jan-16,5,"I love IheartRadio. I recently had to reset my first generation Kindle Fire. After trying to reinstall the App, the Kindle said that it was Not Compatible with my device. After jumping through hoops to reinstall it. We just turned on the Install from other sources button in the menu and downloaded an older .APK file of the App from the Internet. Using the File Manager App and going to Downloads, we found that Iheartradio installed the older version just fine. The older Iheartradio .apk file is available if you look for it. I just transferred it from my Windows computer to Downloads in the Kindle First Generation and it installed and works just fine. We don't have all the latest Pop Up Video Advertisements but everything about the I Heart App works great. The reason I knew that the New App should work is because we own two of the exact same model Kindles. The second Kindle was not reset and the Newer App is working Great with it. We hope that this will help someone else having problems with the I Heart Radio App."
iHeartRadio,commercials galore!,janakorn,18-Jun-14,1,Couldn't stand hearing all the awful commercials and radio blather. Didn't realize it's Clear Channel which is a Monopoly. Switched to Pandora...AH!
iHeartRadio,Wonderful Radio App,Beba,13-Aug-13,5,I really like this app. All kinds of music to choose from.  You can select as many as you like.  Love it!!!
iHeartRadio,Amazing!,root beer,20-Jun-13,5,This is absolutely the best music app ever. In my opinion. It's easy to navigate and it knows exactly what you want. It's a wonderful app. I would recommend it.
iHeartRadio,Great to have!,Flyingbug,16-Feb-13,5,"Miss the stations in your area?  All you need to use this app are a password and an internet connection.  I've got stations from my local area, NYC, San Diego, and elsewhere. This is a must-have app if you want to listen to a Cumulus Media station on your device.However, this app does not stream international radio (I use TuneIn for that on my device)."
iHeartRadio,amazing,aniyah maxwell,23-Aug-13,5,It works never skips you can find any song you wanna hear but the only thing is it don't work without internet
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio - Free music and Internet Radio,Deborah,16-May-14,5,"I chose this rating because I love to listen to various types of music!  I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet.  I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day.  I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription.  I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it.  The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc.  Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire!  I would highly recommend this App to family, friends, and acquaintances!  I hope my recommendation will entice anyone who reads it to try it out."
iHeartRadio,Project 9-6-1,#NAME?,30-Aug-12,1,Bring back the project! You have turned my favorite radio station into nostop top 40 crap. This is torture. We want the project back.

You can listen to all your favorite songs, singers etc for free.  As well as any stations in the US; I haven't checked to see if you can get any overseas stations yet. Unfortunately I have one complaint.  If you're in an area that doesn't have ""WiFi"",you can't use this app"

iHeartRadio,So much music,Cap'n John,15-Aug-13,5,"I'm in my fifties and recently downloaded this. I was pleasantly surprised by how much music and the variety that iHeart has. I can listen to music from my high school days at work and then find something a little louder once I get home. With the huge collection, I could probably find music from when my folks were dating."
iHeartRadio,:(,someone,18-Jul-12,1,"this app was good, until i forgot my password. i asked it to send it to me throgh email. it got there 1 week later. when i put the password in, it said it was wrong! i went back to the email, and wrote down the password. i copied it into the password box, and it still said it was wrong! i think this app is a disappointment. i recommend songza!"
iHeartRadio,Very enjoyable!!!! Has streaming problems,TM,6-Aug-16,4,"This iheart radio app is amazing, has most of the station's on the air I enjoy, has other radios and settings, and just like Pandora as you can choose any genre or artist, or create you're own station. The only problem that I had is the streaming is sometimes temporarily off, but other than that, I heart iheart radio!!!!!"
iHeartRadio,"Goodbye Spotify, Hello iHeartRadio!",Moxie,6-Jun-14,5,"I had not heard of iHeartRadio until I got my Kindle Fire HD 7"" and now I don't know how I tolerated the unpaid edition of Spotify on my laptop for so long. You can listen to live radio stations or create your own customized station by either song or artist.  So, when I plugged in Celine Dion, not only do I get, at random, various songs of hers, but it also begins playing similar artists (which is a good way to learn of different artists).  If you like the song playing, it offers a thumbs up and a thumbs down button.  If you like the song, it acknowledges that and continues to play; if you don't like the song, it stops immediately and avoids playing it again.  If you don't click on either up or down, random songs of similarity will continue to play indefinitely.  If you want to retain the Celine Dion customized station, just click on the + button to add it to your favorites; it will be there the next time you access iHeartRadio.  The beauty of iHeartRadio is no commercials!  Of course, if it's live streaming of a radio station, you will hear those commercials, but there are no commercials on the customized stations!  There is probably even more to discover about iHeartRadio, but this is my early introduction and usage to date, and I'm loving it!  The app is free on Kindle Fire HD 7"", another plus!"
iHeartRadio,Hate the mandatory facebook option,rainbow16,27-Dec-11,3,"I love the iHeartRadio app, it works great on my Galaxy Tab, but I hate the fact that I have to log into my facebook account in order to save my favorite stations.  I also have this widget on my Verizon Fios and I love it there but not so much on my tab ONLY becuz I can't save my favorite stations.  Bummer!!!"
iHeartRadio,Worked great on one device...won't work on the other,Doug Graham,24-Feb-13,5,"This device is incompatible with my current Android Device. Kind of a shame, really, since the radio station I like to listen to doesn't have enough wattage out to reach my home. It worked on my previous Android Device beautifully.EDIT: Since getting the new Nexus Tablet, I re-downloaded this app. Now I can listen to my favorite Spokane, WA, radio station again...and ""Nights With Alice Cooper"" :D"
iHeartRadio,I Heart is a love!,suz,29-Aug-13,5,"Tried I heart recently and found it to be clear and terrific for my Kindle Fire.  You can simply bypass the suggestions and move ahead to listening.  There are ads as on most radio stations, but you move on to the next choice if you don't want to hear them. Brief description given on kind of music offered per station and listing of cities abround the US.  Nice download."
iHeartRadio,great,Pen Name,22-Feb-13,5,I love iheart radio I have my own personal stations of my own and I have all my set stations I tell everybody about iheart radio.

iHeartRadio,"Super Solid Internet Radio App, Clear Cut Privacy Policy",Tinfoot,22-May-14,5,"What a honest, neat app!  First, a quick treatment concerning the permissions.  I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy, and everything is upfront and optable.  ClearChannel only shares information with 3rd Parties in two cases: a) delegation directly involved in providing app services b) when the user *voluntary* opt-ins for marketing (none of that ""you automatically agreed to get marketed"" guff).  When I initially looked at the social circle registration,  I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications.  The email address registration is the most ""private"" method of registration.  All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in-app adverts; however, they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming, nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing.  These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you ""X"" out of them.  Otherwise, for a freebie radio with custom channels, this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design, I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad, confusing, advertising riddled interfaces.  iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI.  I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what, but in about 6 minutes I had my custom ""Beatles"" channel made and audio commercial-free streaming.  Sweet!  I especially love the mix selector.  Double Sweet!  On top of everything, a moderately low RAM footprint (approx 46mbs during streaming, less than my Chrome Browser).  This app gets 5 solid stars and a Woot!*Addendum: As of 20Jun14, apparently a recent update has done away with the intermittent static adverts and replaced them with a single streaming advert at the beginning, in this case a T Mobile commercial.  Can't exit out of it, but it is rather short and bearable for a free radio service.*"
iHeartRadio,YOU DONT NEED FACEBOOK!!!!!!!!,Amazon Customer,3-Jun-13,5,"You guys can use use your email. It has an option to do that or facebook. Anyway, this app is awesome!"
iHeartRadio,Great app until you realize it only plays a handful of songs on repeat...,Gert Blansten,27-Dec-16,3,"At first, I got this app and absolutely loved it!  It was the greatest thing I had ever seen, and I loved that it was completely ad free... notice how that is past tense.  After listening to it for a few weeks, I began to realize I was hearing the same song over... and over... and over....... and over, again.  There is very little variety on this app.  That being said, it is free and it will stream non-stop until you turn it off (unlike the free version of Pandora, which turns itself off when it decides you are no longer listening).  My wife uses this app to keep music playing in my sons room while he sleeps, through the night.  Unfortunately, it too will shut of, unexpectedly, which creates a silence that almost always wakes him up.  This can get annoying when it is 2 in the morning and I have to get up in an hour and a half.  All of that being said, it is free.  You can't expect to get things for free and them to be as good as something you pay for, all I ask is they put a litttllleee more time and effort into this app."
iHeartRadio,We have been able to enjoy news and music with that little bit of aloha ...,Amazon Customer,8-Jul-16,4,Been missing Hawaii and a trip there for a visit hasn't happened in a few years. We have been able to enjoy news and music with that little bit of aloha added in from the first place we called home together. so many stations to choose from it has been fun exploring what's available.
iHeartRadio,worthless,gexx,6-Nov-11,1,"will not open. only forcecloses. when it asks to update, the file is not correct. worthless. it used to work on my phone, a month ago... now it will not. samsung infuse"
iHeartRadio,best of best,Meela Lynn,18-Apr-13,5,"I use to think Pandora was the best. But then I downloaded this, let me tell you... it's way easier to use simple and I can fall asleep without leaving the music running all night long! To me it's more than just a music player, but there's no words to even describe how amazing and simple it is =). This is just my opinion and I want you all to hear about it."
iHeartRadio,It's Terrific!,John Doe,4-Aug-16,5,"I use it several days per week. Great for the gym or taking walks. I love it. Minimal commercials. I especially enjoy that it automatically created a station made up of songs I had at one point or another given a ""thumbs up"" to.  I absolutely love it!"
iHeartRadio,Love it!,Lori L.,25-Aug-13,5,"My husband & I both have iheart on our phones. We love how you can choose artist, genre, song, etc. We decided to purchase it for our daughter's kindle because she is always wanting to buy songs which can get expensive! We all love it!!"
iHeartRadio,Update this app,Mike,4-Mar-17,1,How embarrasing this app is from 2015 and GPlay is 2017. Update this app. It crashes constantly.
iHeartRadio,iHeart radio over Pandora anyday!!!!,Sarah Jenkins,22-Aug-13,5,What's not to love? I will listen to iHeart radio over Pandora any day. I have never had a complaint :)
iHeartRadio,Great station. you can play different songs,Linda,4-Jul-16,4,Great station.you can play different songs. You can also get local stations and also other stations from different towns.  love it..
iHeartRadio,A lot of content.,RoyBlaze,3-Oct-14,5,"Wow!  Who knew?  I am in my 60's and try to keep up but it isn't easy.  I have Sirius/XM and love it and I have the app and that is great but  wanted to get a local station and downloaded iHeart to see if they had it, they don't but I found a plethora of other channels that I loved, mostly comedy.  Like Larry the Cable Guy and John Pinette and Jim Gaffigan and Lewis Black, you get the idea.  There are only a few from each performer than a bunch of others like Ralphie May and Gabrielle Eglesis.  I believe they are come on's to buy the albums but still there is a lot of content here.  And tons of music.  I run it on my Kindle Fire HD and think it is great.  When I was a kid we had transistor radios and huge record players, this stuff is amazing compared to that."
iHeartRadio,My favorite music app,K. Dillingham,23-Jun-16,5,"I like it better than most other radio apps and it is easier to turn off push notifications with this one and the commercials are far less with this than some competitors.  Lots a great radio stations from all over too.  I was able to find a UK sports station and listen to all UK basketball games, which is nice since I don't live in Kentucky."
iHeartRadio,Best music act,DNA squad 1,10-Jun-16,5,"This app is amazing, it is even better than Pandora in the fact you can listen to legit radio stations. And it's free."
iHeartRadio,I really do heart iheartradio....,jmoc13,27-Aug-13,5,"Awesome app, but no in app volume control, just the kindle volume control, and no scroll to know how long the song is or has left, but if you just want the tunes, and isn't that the whole point of the app, then this app does the job."
iHeartRadio,Interim Review - You DON'T NEED FACEBOOK,Riverlizzie Reviews,23-Jul-13,4,"I'm new to I <3 Radio and will add to my review with more listening time.  Meanwhile, I'm happy with  everything, especially the variety on my 'created' station. Also wanted to point out that FACEBOOK is your choice, not required."
iHeartRadio,Its agreeable,The Walking Dead,20-Jul-14,4,"It's good for the standards I was looking for:good music,any radio station I wanted,music from different states,and to just have music when I wanted!But there's a few problems that I had and they made this app disappointing which is:you have a a certain amount off skips for each day which means if you wanted to go through an artist's album you can skip through but you don't have unlimited skips so you have to wait through every song just to reach the next which gets frustrating,next when you look up a song they sometimes don't have the right one or they just don't have it,also some stations are not there,I live in Pennsylvania and I tried to look up a lot of our good stations but they were not there,so therefore it's a good app but it doesn't come to every extent you would like,there's probably many more problems and or many more good things about this app but trust me it's only good for the radio stations.PS-This app does include a great Comedy station,they are hilarious and it's worth listening too!*I do recommend this app."
iHeartRadio,It's a great music app.,D. Reynolds,6-Aug-16,4,"The app is amazing for listening to all of your favorite artists. The only thing that I don't particularly like is that you only have a limited amount of skips and that's kind of a bummer. Overall, though, it is a great app."
iHeartRadio,iLike,Pinkcat,29-Dec-16,5,"I was looking for a little radio to listen to AM talk shows in the morning.  My son told me to just download this app on my Kindle Fire, and I was like..wha? I didn't know this existed, but he downloaded it for me. This works great on my fire, and I can walk around the house with it just like a radio.  The sound quality is great. I'm very happy with this app!"
iHeartRadio,Loving the variety!!!!!!!!!,Yvette White,22-Aug-13,5,"I'm enjoying the variety of radion stations available.  Depending on my mood, I can find something to suit how I'm feeling.I'm kind of confused with logging on to facebook though.  Help."
iHeartRadio,Better than local; will never equal the past.,Michael E. McCord,29-Aug-15,4,"It is 100% better than any radio station out there today; that being said, it does not come close to the stations, and the independent format of decades ago. How many remember the ""King Biscuit Flower Hour""?  There are literately millions of albums and singles out there which are never played; although not a top 40 format, they do repeat the same song within a few hours. I remember well the great independent format of the late 60's and early 70's WQSR 102.5  Sarasota FL; its call letters were Quad 102 1/2, in today's market everything pre-recorded on a disk, I doubt if ever we will see or I should say hear real music format again."
iHeartRadio,It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work,Taezya,18-Jan-17,3,"I picked this becuz I couldn't get Pandora to work on my phone while I was at work.  The only problem is the selections.  This program doesn't have that wide a selection which you choose a station.  Say you choose Katy Perry.  They'll also play Selena Gomez, Demi Levato, and Ariana Grande.  Unfortunately I can think of several others that should come up becuz I ahve the same station on Pandora and they dont.  I could of course just pick a different station but finding something that would suit all my needs is a pain and you can't combine stations or I would have.  It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work lol"
iHeartRadio,non functional to create station on Fire,AC,11-Dec-11,1,"There is a massive Fire conflict occurring now. try to create station. log into fb. on privacy screen where you select sharing prefer, there is no button or action visible to move forward to finally create the station. therefore, no Pandora-like customization available. typing has massive lag-1-3 secs from hitting a letter until when it appears. uninstalled and reinstalled. same false situation.please publish bug and fix. thanks-"
iHeartRadio,overall good app,alexm86,16-Dec-12,4,"Pretty good app, lots of radio stations to choose from. Unlike what others said, you do NOT need a facebook account to use this (maybe this was the case in the past, but not aymore). I signed up just using my email, which I didn't mind.My only issue with this app is that it can crash sometimes on my Kindle Fire when trying to open it. Other than that, it works great. Other good radio apps are Pandora and TuneIn Radio (live stations)."
iHeartRadio,Awesome,Nicole Bloodgood,8-Jan-17,5,"This app is so perfect. Love the variety! I learned about new artists I really like because when you make one station for a certain song or artist it includes other songs along the same genre. The only issue is having to be connected to the internet, but other than that I get to l listen to Melanie Martinez, Twenty one pilots, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At The Disco, Black Veil Brides, Evanascence and so much more at its best."
iHeartRadio,Getting Better,TGautney49,4-Jan-15,5,"I've always preferred this over Pandora because the ads are less intrusive (there are no commercials in the radio except for random times when you first open a custom radio station. Even then it only happens once, but most ads are pop-ups within the app itself). There is also no premium version that you have to pay monthly, therefore you are getting best quality already... for free! Also there are not only custom radio stations, but real radio stations all over the U.S. and Canada. Another plus over Pandora is the fact that you can &#34;tag&#34; a station (doesn't matter if it is a real station or not) as your favorite so that you can easily access it instead of searching for it every time or looking in your recently played section.  (As far as I know, there is no limit on the amount of favorites that you can have.) The more you use the program (there is an online website at www.iheart.com) the better it gets to know you do that it can predict your search! Even better is the fact that it has gone through so many updates and bug fixes that the layout is not only easier to navigate, but also a better quality app."
iHeartRadio,Disappointed,Eddie,28-May-16,1,Tried to open said I didn't own the app after creating an account and also got internal error said no Internet but was on Internet to download.  Removed it as not worth the hassle
iHeartRadio,"Hello iHeartRadio, good-bye KFLD talk radio!",roperi,26-Jan-17,5,"This app turned out to be a blessing.  My home town Talk Radio station, out of the blue, dropped the Sean Hannity radio program from their line-up. My calls to their office go unanswered.  It made me question their motives.  So I looked on the internet and found iHeart Radio.  I'm 60 years old and this app is very user friendly, I have no trouble with it.  I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio, in New York City, of all places (I live in WA State),  I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle, or my computer and even on my Windows phone.  Love this app.  So for me its Hello iHeart Radio, good-bye KFLD talk radio."
iHeartRadio,I heart radio,Judy Jakob,19-Mar-17,5,Love this app. I like it better than Pandora. With this app you can play the music that you want either by song or artist.
iHeartRadio,best,Mike,21-Jun-13,5,This app is good I have it on everything. Listen to it all the time. Some times it tAkes long time yo load but other then. that it's great
iHeartRadio,dosen't even play,thisguy777,28-Dec-11,1,i keep going on this thing to see if it might work... it dosen't. don't get this. it's a complete waste of space on your device.
iHeartRadio,Makes Uncertainty Simple!,Herself,9-Nov-16,5,"I've had an IHeart account for years but I never used it until my school work got so overwhelming and I needed some music to help block everything out but I could never decide what to listen to. But now that I've been using it for the past few weeks my ""favorites radio"" has developed into a super awesome personalized playlist and it's so much easier to chill out and I'm done with my work before I even know it :)"
iHeartRadio,I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS! _Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ,RiÂ¢her,11-Feb-17,1,"This app store sucks! Not only is there limited apps, but the ones that they do have never get updated. On top of that, if any of your accounts uses your Google account to log in, the app doesn't let you have an option that lets you log in with it which means this app is useless unless you make an Iheartradio account or Facebook account."
iHeartRadio,Keeps defaulting to a station I do not want!,Michelle Mobley,20-Sep-17,4,"I jumped on this so I could hear my favorite talk station that I listened to when I lived in L.A.  Then I found great jazz stations around the U.S. on this app, so all is good.The only downside is that this app keeps insisting that I signed-up for a pop-country station...the kind that plays big money bling country.  If I was interested in a country station, I would only want to hear old school country that is real...not the crap that is cranked out by the Illuminati millionaire machine.  Until a station like that lands on the iHeart app, I will keep turning-off the station that I did not add to my selections on this app (it keeps defaulting to that dreadful station...argh!)"
iHeartRadio,Able to live stream some local radio stations,Meka B,26-May-16,5,"This is the best app for streaming live radio broadcast throughout the US. I love listening to different cities DJ's, preform and entertain the audience. I'm able to customize my own radio station with my favorite artist and groups. I like the idea of listening to the app without giving any personal information such as name and email address. This also limits my access on the app like voting, liking etc, but I'm Okay with that.This is a free app for purchase via download and install."
iHeartRadio,I just love this app,Roberta,4-Sep-14,5,"I just love this app.  I put on my favorite station while I'm exercising, and the time just flies.  I love The Beatles station, which is what I happen to listen to while I'm on the elliptical, and the mix of songs they play is fantastic.  I guess I can only speak for that station at this point, but for that one alone, it is worth the download.  I also listen to some of the ""talk"" shows, but there are a lot of breaks in the show for commercials about the show itself.  I don't think it has anything to do with the app because I've listened my favorite show on regular radio, and there are A LOT of commercial breaks.  At least you don't have to listen to commercial commercials, but it is still frustrating.  I'll have to explore some more music stations, but so far, I couldn't be happier.  I hope iHeartRadio keeps The Beatles station.  They are showing it as ""celebrating 50 years"" of their music, so I'm wondering if the station will disappear at the end of the year.  I sure hope not."
iHeartRadio,get a map,justin k,30-Jul-12,1,south Dakota is a state.  right?  no stations.  serious?can someone look into adding our state to the United States.  would appreciate it
iHeartRadio,"I love it, but there's two problems....",Kindle Customer,9-Aug-17,3,"I got this app two days ago, and it's awesome! I can listen to whatever I want, and I don't even have to be on the app to listen to it! I can be on Instagram and listen to my music. In fact, I'm listening to it as I am writing this review. But there is one ting about the app I absolutely CANNOT STAND. You have a limited number of times you can skip songs. That is just stupid on SO many levels. Why in the heck would an app have limited skips?!?!?!?! How stupid can you get? The other problem is that you can't be under 14 or something like that to get an account. Me and my sister had to lie to get an account. I am 13, I should be able to have an account for myself because of my age...."
iHeartRadio,Wth happened!,Shelley Ott,20-Jul-16,1,"I have been using this daily, for months, and loved it for my runs. Suddenly, an ""internal error"" message. What did you guys do to screw this up for all of us. Wouldn't even give you 1 star, but if I have to, I have to."

iHeartRadio,Is it a great app? It's an outstanding app!,gleeming,15-Feb-15,5,"Wow! Honestly, I've heard the iHeart radio app commercial on the radio so many times that over and over I thought: Oh, another Pandora music station thing. :P (insert eye roll here). However, I am so impressed! I never thought I could substitute an actual radio, iTunes, mp3, or Pandora but this is so much better than Pandora! Warning before you go any further: I did sign up with my email. They have so many radio/ playlist options to choose from based on your favorite types of music.  Thus far, I've not heard any songs I hate. Not only this, but the app is free. FREE! Take that Pandora! On my kindle, at least, it plays on while I go surf the web or play other apps which I find really cool. It seems as if you don't have to use your email to use the app but you'll be able to customize your radio if you do. It's definitely worth the free payment and gigabite storage for you music lovers out there. I definitely recommend this app to all you and I'm very picky about which games, videos, apps, books, etc. I put on my device. I hope this review was worth the read! Have a great day. :)"
iHeartRadio,The PROs and PRO CONsss....,Bob K.,22-Feb-16,5,"The pros: I liked the fact that I didn't have to tell it each hour that I was listening to it.  The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me.  I'd recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them.  Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON.  LOL."
iHeartRadio,Must have app!,Bruce,2-Jun-16,5,Great app this is a must have on any device.
iHeartRadio,"Great Access to Music, Lousy UI",Cody Montana,15-Feb-14,3,"Reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content, recommendations, and application's features, functionality, and user interface in both web and mobile versions. Overall, I like the system but hate the app. Here are the details.What I Like:- Huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music- Good album recommendations algorithm provided by EchoNest identifies relevant new albums to explore- Excellent Autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks (i.e., recommended tracks)- Web interface is very usable, providing intuitive navigation to the various featuresWhat I Dislike:- Mobile app's functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically, and can be slow to respond to user navigation. Buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in WiFi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups, such as ""hunting"" for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app.- Mobile app's features are imbalanced; on the one hand, it provides a great many choices for user behavior (social aspects, exploration and discovery aspects, recommendations at the album and track level, etc.) but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc. For example, I have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are ""hot"" in my neck of the woods, yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left-side start-up screen menu that I cannot configure- Much of the app interface's flow seems to differ from that of the web interface, which is confusing- Transparent or ""disappearing control"" UI design in web interface, while trendy these days (e.g., Gmail folder scroll bar) , is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it, and since two-finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame, you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic UI nav function that should be something you don't even have to think about."
iHeartRadio,If you love Radio then you will love this app,Kenn Caesius,18-Aug-15,5,"Its about the only radio over web app you want to use if you are regular radio listener, or if you are niche listener like the music or talk radio.The Iheartradio is the tablet app that is finall available for the Kindle Fire that allows users listen to an variety of music radio, music channels dedicated to particular genres,  talk programs, and some television station audio.Its an alright app.  I would becareful about using this app if you have a limited data plan.  Not that it takes up alot of data or bandwidth but its so simple to loose track of how much you are downloading."
iHeartRadio,I really appreciate how easy it is!,Dawn D,24-Dec-13,5,"I enjoy listening to music any time but I find it makes cleaning and most other things (such as wrapping presents as I am working on now) seem to go that much smoother and faster! I particularly enjoy using this app because I can just choose a station that fits whichever chore I'm working on or musical mood I'm in and I can listen wherever I am without worrying whether the station will tune in well or have static as I often experienced and was frustrated by with any alarm clock or other type of standard radio receivers! I have this app installed on my kindle fire HD as well as on my smartphone and I regularly use both! Also, I love that you are able to log in either through your Facebook account or, if you're like me and don't care to share your listening preferences with all your friends (my preferences vary so extremely that I would probably come across as having a multiple personality), through your email. Finally, I love that the commercial breaks aren't overwhelming...from what I recall I would say that the commercial breaks are comparable to a standard radio station such as what I used to listen to before this app!"
iHeartRadio,Better Than Pandora,Megan,18-Aug-13,5,"In my opinion, this is better than Pandora in some ways...First, Pandora has a LOT of ads...and this has about 1/8 the amount of ads. Also, it is easier to control.Personally, I like Pandora music choices better.Hope this helps!"
iHeartRadio,Good App,Mark Askew,23-Aug-13,5,App works as good as I hoped. I am recommending  it to all of my friends and family to download.
iHeartRadio,Sweet,Mom of Two,27-Mar-16,4,If you like your music mixed up this is an app for you. It provides a lot of variety. Love it!
iHeartRadio,Awesome Music App,s.w.,11-Aug-15,5,"This app is awesome when listening to music. You can choose radio stations like the point, air1, KLove, and much more. Another good thing is that u can search song by singer, song name, or album. When u first start u have to type in a Zip Code, but u can just skip it. And u dont need a Facebook account for it, your choice. The good thing I like is I can listen to my Minecraft music, Fnaf music, and 90's music. And u can search names if songs and stuff while ur still listening. The music will also work if u go on another game. And I have a kindle so while im playing my game I can slide that thing from the top down and cut it off, skip it, or pause it. And speaking of skipping the things, u have limited daily skips, I wouldnt skip so much and waist the skips. But see im only 10 so for me this is the best app for music I can get. But when u type in a song or name or album it has to be exact or it will say &#34;Song Not Found&#34;and stuff. But this is a great app for music and I recommend this app for all ages. Best app I can get. Get this app if like music."
iHeartRadio,Fantastic!!!,Awesome girl,1-Oct-15,5,"This app is the best! If you have a favorite song, you can create a customizable station just for you around that song, and sculpt it to your taste in music over time. They have loads of genres available, and tons of predesigned stations around those genres. You can listen to your local radio, too, if that's your cup of tea. But I would give this app 11/10! Best music experience I've had with any app ever. Which reminds me, why are reading this when you could be downloading iHeartRadio?? It's actually free, it won't cost you a single penny, unlike other apps."
iHeartRadio,Great app! Great choices of stations and very clear ...,pookahatch,3-Jul-16,5,Great app! Great choices of stations and very clear reception. To me it's the must have app for music lovers.
iHeartRadio,Get it while its free!,Lauren Brown,13-Aug-13,5,"iheart radio you can listen on the radio but the app is like ""Pandora"" but better cause you can pause the radio the next day whithout it deleting."
iHeartRadio,This is a excellent app. Don't listen to the people who say ...,Natalie Flynn,21-Mar-16,5,"This is a excellent app. Don't listen to the people who say you need facebook, (it's not true.)  You can sign in with facebook or email, but that's only if you want to save stations or make your custom station and also you can still listen to the radio without facebook or email.  I have iHeart radio on my android phone and kindle fire table and it works great....Also love that there are rare to NO advertising......  Thank you Love this app!!!"
iHeartRadio,I have this app on my 2012 Nexus 7 (currently ...,Michael Hanson,8-May-15,3,"I have this app on my 2012 Nexus 7 (currently running Android Lollipop 5.1.1), a BLU Win JR (running Windows Phone 8.1), a HP laptop (Windows 8.1), and now on my new Fire HD 7.I noticed that this app is a bit slower to load (while streaming) and possibly prone to skipping (I usually have it running in the background/screen off so not sure), but I did run this app on both the Nexus and Fire side by side on one of those ""Perfect For"" radio stations and noticed that the one on Android loaded new content a bit quicker, but I think that is because the Fire takes the time to remove any ""buy here"" links that aren't Amazons. My guess is that there is a bit of code that looks at the next song on the playlist and if it isn't available at Amazon, then that song will get automatically skipped."
iHeartRadio,I heart $@#Â¥Â¿Â£,Tandgn,28-Jan-14,4,"Only the best app ever!!! If you Don't mind interruptions due to interrupted digital signals. Weather it's the apps one uses, or if there in no proper signals which is frustrating (digital! Got to love it!). It still is an awesome app because it has the best stations to choose from and of course setting up your own stations and being able to purchase music you like. It may never be a 5 star app for me (until it can get a clean signal that stays clean for longer than 30 minutes). It always fails when your listening to something interesting (conspiracy much!!!). But it's probably my fault for its failure to totally satisfy me. Still it's worth the download."
iHeartRadio,couldnt went wrong love it the best,jedlicka,19-Jun-13,5,I love this its the best I'm always playing this station I like the sounds of Detroit station play it everyday. At work and at home love it.
iHeartRadio,Better than Pandora,Emily,21-Sep-13,5,"I like how there is usually one commercial when you start a new station, and none after that. The mix of music and ability to change the dial for familiar, mixed, or unfamiliar music is awesome and has lead me to some bands I've never heard of (which is rare for me). I like the option to listen to stations from my hometown and the places I've traveled. I use iHeart Radio every day at work, it gets me through my day and has a station for every taste!"
iHeartRadio,Easy to install,Pamela,23-Feb-13,5,Listen to Clear Channel stations all the time.  Travel  around country sometimes so nice to always find my favorite talk shows!
iHeartRadio,Two drawbacks,Jolie_B,6-Dec-12,4,"I love iHeartRadio except for the fact that it's insistent about wanting to log you in with Facebook. It's not a huge deal for me. I have a Facebook account. But I HATE it when sites want me to use that since I consider it a security/privacy risk to log into everything using Facebook. Let's face it, Facebook can't even keep people from making damaging, virus laden applications so they are hardly the epitome of safe sites. I prefer setting up different passwords for different sites.This app also seems to have issues keeping track of the songs I've liked and disliked when I shut it down and restart it. The web version doesn't seem to be synched up to the app version despite me logging into my account to get my personalized stations. That's a shame because I keep having to tell it I hate certain artists to get it to not play them every time I use the app on my Kindle.Other than that, I have no problems with it. It allows me to get my favorite radio stations I've been missing since I moved away from Houston to New Jersey. It can be run in the background while I play games or read my books, which is awesome. You can't expect perfection for free. It does what it promises which is more than I can say for some apps I've had. :-D"
iHeartRadio,I can listen to Frank Beckmann on WJR!,Tim,13-Aug-13,5,I really enjoy Beckmann on WJR but since moving to northern Michigan it's often tough to pick up WJR.  With iHeart I can alway listen to Frank on our tablet.
iHeartRadio,I heart I heart radio :),OxfordDECA,14-Aug-13,5,"My favorite thing about it is I can pick songs/artists that I like and they play similar music, which I never knew of or would've checked out on my own.it's really opened my music genres! No negatives"
iHeartRadio,Favorite Music ApP,Amazon Customer,23-Jan-13,5,This is by far my favorite music app . i used to like Pandora and slacker. But I found this app and Its totally free. I Listen to this app from 6 to 10 every morning . I listen to Bud And Broadway. They are awesome. Couldnt live without it
iHeartRadio,LOVE IT!,Kindle Customer,28-Apr-16,5,"This is such a good app! Do you wanna listen to music while playing on your other apps? Then this is for you. You can create your own list of fav songs, categorized into stuff like classical rock, pop, hip-hop, and others. I DISAGREE WITH THE ONE STAR REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!_Ÿ˜€"
iHeartRadio,Wonderful Way to Get the Kind of Music You Want,Russell W. Shurts,18-Mar-14,5,"I suspect I could use this service to get live sports talk or news and opinion, but so far I have only used it to create my own 'radio stations' based on some of my favorite musicians and singers.  iHeartRadio allows you to select a particular recording artist to create a 'radio station' from and it will automatically select songs that are similar in style to the artist you have picked.  It is a novel way of providing music, and the system gives you the ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on any music selection you listen to.  In this way you can get your station or stations to be very close to the type of music you would like to listen to at that time.It's wonderful to be able to get music this way, and like I said there is probably a lot more I could do with the service beyond just the music."
iHeartRadio,Difficult,problemnoticergirl,7-Jul-17,1,"Where do I start? As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I didn't even choose, it's super slow, and recently it's been telling me I can't UAE it because something from my app store wasn't updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it's not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I'm better off deleting it."
iHeartRadio,Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio,Stella Carrier,12-Dec-14,5,"I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio  feature after seeing them featured online-through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area.  Anyhow, as in Pandora, iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally, iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as Iâ€™m listening to their music. I have over 30 music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance, the donâ€™t stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However, here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna, pet shop boys, deppeche mode, tiesto, armin van buuren, calvin harris, 2am ambient, pitbull,dancin 90s, Britney spears , adam lambert, euro-dance, Darren hayes, foofighters, the 90s unglued, one republic, lasgo, Swedish house mafia, ellie Goulding, Fergie, robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see, the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."
iHeartRadio,It's okay as long as you like the programming,A photographer,16-May-13,3,"If you enjoy listening to your local Clear Channel radio stations, you will probably like this app.  You also gain access to numerous other Clear Channel radio stations around the country with various programming formats and genres.  The limitation is that this is pretty mediocre programming.  I'm not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music being programmed.  No matter what the genre, corporate radio manages to play music that all sounds the same.  Since radio plays homogenized sounds, recording companies record music that all sounds the same.  Pretty boring stuff.To be fair, I've not sampled every single radio station offered on this app.  I am familiar with the local stations (typical of the music described above) and what other stations I've sampled seem to have the same programming.  So, if you like this type of music, you'll enjoy this app."
iHeartRadio,I heart radio app,Vladimir Calderon,4-Jan-16,3,"To be honest here the app design sucks, I mean it is very disappointing the fact that you need to go by state or country in to oder to find a radio station. You should make the app more simple and similar to the surface rt or Xbox 360 iheart radio app. In the surface rt or Xbox 360 when searching for a live radio station from its genre it shows all the radio stations from all over the world in that genre that you first chose. Another thing is when creating radio stations the search bar should be smarter."
iHeartRadio,Why I like iheart Radio,Herman L. Robinson,1-Aug-13,5,"I like the fact that I can pick the type of music that I like,and that it gives me a variety of what I love to listen to without having to put up with stuff that I don't like,so I recommend this site for people who love music. So I give it five stars."
iHeartRadio,Radio on the go,BluesHawk707,14-Sep-13,4,"The iHeartRadio app is very easy to use and can be tailored to your musical preferences.  It uses the device's wireless to connect to the radio stations you love so you have to be connected to the internet or some sort of public wireless system for it to work.  I found it enjoyable to use - you can choose radio stations near you or ones from where you are from if you are traveling.  It lists the artist and song title during each song so you know what's playing.  I found it does drain the battery considerably with prolonged use (an hour or so) but it's not much different than similar apps so you may want to keep it plugged in if you are going to listen to it for a while.What I did like is the ability to listen to new music and to learn who the new up and coming artists were.  Again, very convenient way to listen to music and know who you are listening to."
iHeartRadio,I love IHeart radio!,Patricia,17-Feb-16,5,"I really really like and enjoy IHeart radio!  There are a few other Internet Radio options and I actually have downloaded others and compared them to iHeart radio.  This is the best one for me hands down!  I love building my own stations that I listen to depending on my mood and what I feel like listening to at the time.  The only complaint that I have (which is a minor one) is the skip limit.  Usually the songs that are playing are exactly what I  want to hear, but sometimes I do have the need to skip a few songs in a row and I hate having a limit.  I would actually pay to have the option of unlimited skips.  I think that should be an option and I'm sure there are other listeners out there who would pay for this feature as well.  I still am fairly new to the app, but am enjoying  all my favorite artists and songs very much!"
iHeartRadio,Good idea bad execution for podcasts,Ilija Stojsavljevic,17-Aug-17,1,"8-24-17IT KEEPS GETTING WORSEApp now will not play the episode i select,Plus there is no easy way to report problems or get help.app is very difficult to use at times after i was forced to use it for proprietary content.when it crashes there is no indexing to where you were in a podcast you need to manually get to the point you were.there is no ability to do a quick 30 or 15 second fast forward or rewind as it requires you to manually do so on the screen which is inconvenient when in a hands free environment when you have the ability to push a button on your Bluetooth headphones.at times it starts right up and other times it just spins and forces you to close the app and hope upon restart it works properly.it is a HUGE memory hog.  after a couple of months of use it needs to be uninstalled to free up memory it does not release on my Fire."
iHeartRadio,A great product at a great price with great customer service,J. Johnson,6-Dec-16,5,Merchandise was shipped promptly and was well packaged.  Merchandise worked exactly as expected and would trust both the manufacturer of said merchandise and the seller of said merchandise again.  A great product at a great price with great customer service.  Would happily buy again.
iHeartRadio,Apparently Kindle Fire doesn't get the updates...,Morgan Van Lier,21-Dec-16,3,"I really like this app but it does need a couple improvements.(ones that other devices get) Since I've had it I have gotten emails on 3 occasions from IHeartRadio stating there are new updates, fixes, etc. But the app for Kindle hasn't had an update since July 2015. They are completely ignoring there Kindle customers."
iHeartRadio,Best music streaming video App!,Shawn L. Gentry,21-Mar-16,5,My only problem with Iheart was that I could only listen to one genre at a time but with the creation of my favorites radio it now does exactly what I want... Without having to pay
iHeartRadio,I like it but can't have it,Kryptonite,13-Apr-13,4,We live in an area with only a wireless connection to the internet.We are limited in our monthly data so must be aware of our usage and careful of it.The iHeartRadio is a wondrful APP. I was able to set up the kind of programming that I wanted.The stations were quick to come in and sound quality is very good.I'm an over the hill user in that I have seen 70 a couple of years ago so my progamming tastes are dated.Even so I found the music and programming you might expect. Artie Shaw still sounds great.BUT. iHeart does a tremendous job of visuals to go along with the music.Visuals add up to excess bytes of info quickly.I had to uninstall the APP as my data usage count surged in just a few uses.If I had a good internet connection with more data per month I would be back to iHeartRadio it is a very good product.It is much better than most of the internet radio apps that I have tried. It is a good one.I wish I could keep it.
iHeartRadio,"Used to be good, now has annoying countdown on channels",Matthew Manter,19-Jun-13,2,"I will be listening to WNCI on Iheart radio so I can listen to their morning show, and suddenly get interrupted by their annoying Iheart Radio count down of top songs. Not just one short group, but two & sometimes three of them. I like to listen to my choice of programming & don't care about Justin Bieber top 5 or whoever else they want to plug. Needless to say I will be finding something else & switching."
iHeartRadio,love it!,Kristen,10-Mar-13,4,"I love being able to listen to all the local radio stations on this app, that's the one thing pandora doesn't have. My only complaint would be that if you turn off the explicit content, it wouldn't let you on any stations after that to listen to music, you would have to turn it on again. That really bothered me. Though it may have radio stations, pandora doesn't have that problem."
iHeartRadio,SUCKS,Dan,8-Aug-12,1,SUCKS!!To even listen to music you have to sign up. You have to give your E-Mail. And to save you have to sign up for Facebook. I don't have a Facebook account.ITS A SPACE WASTER.(if you don't have a Facebook account)
iHeartRadio,Waste of time and money,Ginger M.,10-Nov-17,1,"Horrible service. Received 3 month free trial with new car purchase. This NEVER worked!  I wasted time programming radio stations and it consistently said ""unable to connect"".  I contacted their customer service dept. on several occasions  and this was their response ""Sorry for the trouble you're having! This is actually a known issue our developers are working on correcting. We hope to have it fixed soon. If you have any questions please let me know.Thanks for your understanding and patience!"" DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS USELESS SERVICE."
iHeartRadio,Absolutely Love It!,Boo,17-Jul-17,5,"I use this App everyday. I use it when I clean. I use it when I walk. I use it when I'm in the shower. I use it to go to sleep to. My mind is always going at maximum speed and music helps to calm it and help me concentrate. I love music like most people do! I love a variety of music from Bob Seger to Marilyn Manson and almost everything in between. What I listen to usually reflects on my feelings at the moment. With this App I have a never ending variety to choose from. I've been using this App for years and I've NEVER had a problem with it. When I first tried iHeart Radio, I also downloaded similar Apps so I could decide what best suited me. Needless to say, the others were uninstalled and I'm still using this one years later. I recommend this App to ANYONE and EVERYONE!!"
iHeartRadio,It's awesome!,Lynnette Shimmin,17-Feb-13,5,It's so refreshing to be able to listen to my local favorites on my Kindle instead of being pidgeon-holed into listening to cable radio that has re-destined formats.  I get my local DJ's and my favorite local programing.
iHeartRadio,"SUCKS WITH AMAZON ECHO, USED TO BE OK...",Amazon Customer,8-Dec-16,2,SUCKS!iswd to.work with amazon.echo but it sucks now... prpbably amazons messed it up as it does with NETFLIX.YOU SEE... NETFLIX ALLOWS YOU TO SAVE MOVIES TO WATCH LATER ON ANDROID AND ON APPLE IPHONES.... NOT OF FIRE PHONES!!!!Called Netflix and they've assured.me that the update has been sent to Amazon...so there you go!!!
iHeartRadio,I'm glad that I have it,Ralph Ware,24-May-17,4,"I'm glad that I have it.  It allows me to find radio stations more suited to my needs and tastes.  I also like that the audio quality is beyond comparison with what I get out of my radio, so the listening pleasure is greatly improved.  My only criticism is that I wish the station categories were more discrete; that I could more easily distinguish a Christian music station from one that was more focused on the fundamentals of scripture and prayer or news and socio-political commentary from a Christian point of view."
iHeartRadio,Best Radio app by far,Jynx,22-Aug-15,5,"I love this app! I've told my friends & family...even strangers how Great it is. My husband, our kids & some of their friends have installed it & it has ran Rly good, even on their Apple iPhones. Pandora plays too many ads, not enough music. I hardly hear ads on iHeart. ONLY my brother had yet to get it, but that's due to iheart not having 93.3 The Planet, Greenville SC. The next best is AccuRadio, which I have on my Kobo Vox ereader since this app won't install. I'm sure if iHeart would add 93.3 they would get more consumers. A LOT of ppl love The Rise Guys."
iHeartRadio,Sucks,Danielle,17-Sep-13,1,"It doesn't play 'like music' nor have a good amount of new or unknown music even when you tell it to. It's pretty bad. It doen't stick to the genre you selected. SURE, Pandora will sneak in Bob Marley into every station, but when I'm listening to Brand New ans Justin Timberlake comes up and makes you say WHOA, wat a minute what the hell just happened, did my station just switch on me? Oh no, it's just iHeartRadio sucking as usual. I had to use this app while living in Costa Rica because Pandora wasn't available. It was depressing. Use Pandora. unless you are like my mom, she would love iHeartRadio. If you are someone who just likes to listen to whatever is trendy in the pop culture genres, this is for you."
iHeartRadio,Pretty Awesome Juat a Few Adjustments,Wollek,19-Aug-16,4,"I love this app. Free music and great suggestions for new music based on your preferences. My only problem though, us it doesn't have all of the live radio stations I want. For example, 94.1 The Wolf for Memphis and Camel Country 108(107.9) for Phoenix."
iHeartRadio,Unreliable,Nicole,27-Sep-17,2,IHeart Radio app is unreliable. It only play's my favorite stations 30% of the time and right now it's not working at all.
iHeartRadio,was happy until it needed Facebook,monkey,19-Nov-11,2,"This app looked pretty cool, but I have tune in radio pro, so I was looking for the make your own station part, but I found out you need a Facebook, but I  don't have/need a Facebook and its seems stupid that you can't make your own station without one"
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio is a great way to listen to your favorite radio stations!,Amazon Customer,13-May-17,5,"iHeartRadio makes listening to my favorite stations much more enjoyable, both local stations I used to listen to over the airand distant stations that are only available through apps like this.  The only disappointment was that a few of the stations Itried to access were unavailable, but I assume some additional stations will be added in the future."

iHeartRadio,iheart radio - An amazing example of Crappy Technology,Amazon Customer,26-May-17,1,"I pretty much hate this app. These are the on going problems that I experience on a daily basis.1) If will just shut off for no reason (regardless of network type).2) Often you cannot get it to restart for a while after it stops. (Often when it goes down it doesn't come back for hours)3) It will randomly restart even after you have closed the app, which can be very frustrating and embarrassing when in important meetings or at dinner.4) Sometimes only commercials play right through the radio programming causing you to miss the entire talk radio broadcast.5) There is nobody to report problems to so they never get fixed.6) The radio station that I listen too is at their mercy as complaining to them is fruitless.7) You spend more time trying to fix it, deisntall it,reinstall it, that you miss your scheduled programming.7) Bottom line, this app has received the official ""Crappy Technology"" award and I now use a cheap, and extremely reliable, AM transistor radio for my talk radio pleasure. It is reliable and never fails.#Iheartradiosucks #kfyicrappytechnology #iheartradiocrappytechnology"
iHeartRadio,Great app!,Doc,3-Apr-13,5,I love that I can listen to all of my favorite local radio stations from just about anywhere. Couldn't ask for much more.
iHeartRadio,"like breathing, very hard to go long without it!",M. Hulshoff,15-Oct-15,5,"As I've said a thousand times before on my GS4, absolutely love it. Can change it in a fraction of a second like my moods.  Only problem lately- I keep getting asked to rate it at least once a song, sometimes twice. I counted.I got asked to rate it 67 times in one day after I had already said I liked it several times and submitted it. I definitely HEART iHeart Radio. I've actually started a whole new collection of CDs from works I've heard here first!"
iHeartRadio,YOU DO NOT NEED FACEBOOK!!!,Rev Dr John Benjamin Tatum DD PhD,13-Jul-12,4,"You can sign up for an account using your email address. Facebook is just a quick ""one click"" standard that is all over the Internet so you do not need to register for every site.  But if you prefer to register through the app using your email address,  you can very easily.  Once you register you can access your account from the [...] website, or their iPhone or Android enabled apps.  The reason ""Facebook"" is so promenent is because of it being a de-facto standard for ""One Click Log On"" from many apps, Yahoo,  newspaper, shopping and many other websites all over the world (easier than remembering usernames and passwords for hundreds or thousands of websites literally... not bad for the ""unimportant"" websites you may log into every so often that have no important information such as saved credit card numbers... such as Amazon.com where you WOULD NOT WANT ""One Click Log On"", or even have your browser remember your username and password). Just something to think about. Again, just by actually looking at the ""registration"" area of iHeartRadio in whatever form (website or app), FACEBOOK IS NOT REQUIRED TO SAVE YOUR SETTINGS, just an email address like any othaer website or app that saves your settings require)."
iHeartRadio,Free music with Iheart Radio,POD,11-Dec-16,5,"Great app for those who like different genres of music. I tune in to the Smooth Jazz stations and the music available is terrific. You can set up a number of favorite stations  on the website under "" My Favorites ""  by establishing log in info. No financial info required for the log in process. The best part is the music is FREE."
iHeartRadio,Mute the Cars for Kids jingle,Amazon Customer,29-Mar-16,3,"I would of given a 5 Star, but you have a certain advertiser ""Cars for Kids"" jingle that is WAY overplayed, I actually mute your station every time I hear it....can not stand it....plus they are just another charity that spends way too much of their advertising campaign....PLUS 40% donations collected goes to admin and advertising...."
iHeartRadio,Very torn on this rating....,vkd62025,13-Jan-13,5,"I loved the way my son has been able to use this on his iphone, so that's why I wanted it on my tablet, but it has not been as great for me.  When I tried to open it, I had to answer a bunch of questions, and it forced a sign in either through my Facebook or email.  I was going to choose Facebook, but then found this is yet another app that wants permission to pretend to be me, and I will NEVER permit any app to do that.  So, back to the sign in.  It proceeded smoothly with the email option, but once I got in, it basically took over my tablet.  I couldn't use anything else, and I HEART RADIO basically froze on my screen.  I had to completely reboot to turn it off.  Doubt I'll use it again on my tablet, which is a pity.  I do like the product, though.  My son has it on his iphone, which plugs into his car system by USB, and I love the ""created"" station option, which lets us pick a genre, and hear the kind of music we prefer without ads & chat.  It's great for road trips."
iHeartRadio,Easy to Use. Listening to Music is great fun,apoem,31-Dec-13,5,"This is a great app.It offers recommendations for music based on other songs you listen to. This is not a problem except that your stationswill not have only the songs you want. When you create stations to listen to songs, for example, if you create a pink station to listen to songs only from Pink- you will find that there are songs from other artists on there. This is a frustration for my 12 year old daughter who wants it to have only songs from pink on her pink station.However, if you push the thumb down on a song, it almost never plays that song again.We have this app on our phone, our ipad, our kindle, and so on. It is an easy to use app.Well worth the effort. Enjoy."
iHeartRadio,I love this app,Amazon Customer,10-Dec-16,5,This app is amazing!! It doesn't have a lot of adds. It plays songs I known that no other music app plays.
iHeartRadio,Iheart vs pandora,Laurie,22-Jul-16,4,Not as user friendly as Pandora. Bluetooth from tablet to a bigger speakers radio...not as good signal compared again Pandora...at least get iHeartRadio in Canada for music though. 2017: I listen to iheart more now and comes in great on tablet in USA. Pandora on my USA tv. All is.great listening.
iHeartRadio,"Great in theory, application only ok",bfo,8-Jan-13,3,"I live in a radio dead zone.  I have satellite for the car, but not the house.  Installed this ap on a kindle fire HD.The good:- price is right (free)- multiple stations for every type of musicThe issues:- Searching for stations is trial and error (I didn't spend a ton of time on this, but when selecting a type of music, then had to go by state to select a station - how do I know whether Alabama or Vermont has better alt rock stations?)- I get a ""click"" about every 10 sec - not very loud, but gets annoying after a while.  I don't know if this is due to my Kindle, my WIFI, the internet provider, or the ap, but it is annoying enough that I only use this for background music when doing something else, don't just sit and listen.Overall, worth trying, hopefully the clicking is a resutl of my set-up vs something in the ap.  If the ap, only useful whne nothing else available."
iHeartRadio,Playlists for personal favorites,Beam2u,4-Feb-16,4,"I wish that in addition to the my stations "" option there would be an option to select individual songs and build differentplaylistsLike rock , country, classic , etc based on personal favoritesThat would be a very awesome featureI'mEnvisioning it like I tunes"
iHeartRadio,Love music,Amazon Customer,2-Mar-17,4,Love just listening to music. Sometimes the music skips like if there was a  scratch on the CD.
iHeartRadio,Won't let me sign up _Ÿ˜ ,K. Santhanam,25-Jun-17,2,"Whenever I put my pincode,whether it's USA or England or whatever,it says there is an error creating my account and my country is not supported.Other than that,I think it's a great app.I've read a lot of reviews and I've seen the features when I pressed maybe later while signing up.Of course,you can't sign up from India because there there are six digit zip codes.The thing for me is I don't have a Facebook account and I don't plan to have one in the future.I have to sign in with my email account.Don't know if this is a problem or my country is really not supported._Ÿ˜• Please fix if this is a problem."
iHeartRadio,Three Stars,Matthew Cihaski,15-Mar-17,3,Great application for listening to radio stations through the web.
iHeartRadio,great for listening to your favorite radio station no matter where you are,Floyd L. Jones,3-Apr-16,5,"With IHeartRadio you can listen to actual radio stations on you phone.  This is great if you move out of state and miss listening to your favorite morning shows.  It is also great if you live out in the boonies and don't get regular radio stations.  I heart radio also has stations for your mood. whether you want sad, happy, or workout music i heart radio has a station for you. This app also has Pod casts you can listen too."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio,Amazon Customer,6-Sep-17,4,Like accessing different programs in one place but sometimes you change to something and it is so loud you wake everyone up and I still can't figure out how to turn a station off without turning off the whole app. Drives me a bit nuts at times.
iHeartRadio,I give iHeart a PERFECT 10!,Linda Clark-Koball,5-May-14,5,"I downloaded iHeart to my Kindle Fire HD. I wish I had found it sooner. I listen to Country, Christian and Rock. No worries about static or guessing what you found while flipping through the stations. You see the station and know exactly what you want to hear. I now listen to Christian K-Love or the Fish while going to sleep at night. There is a sleep timer and an alarm built into iHeart Radio. If there were 10 Stars that is what I would give to iHeart Radio.Thank-you.Sincerely, Linda Clark-Koball"
iHeartRadio,One Star,Daniel Arp,28-Sep-16,1,Unable to get stations or audio
iHeartRadio,easy to use,Kindle Customer,19-Aug-16,5,"God streaming, easy to use, doesn't drop or take loads of time to load music. A good, free service. Worth getting!"
iHeartRadio,This is a great app,Velos,17-Apr-13,5,"I haven't explored all the bells and whistles yet with this app, but so far I am impressed. I got this for my Kindle fire for picking up local stations that sometimes get interferred with by stations coming in from Canada(I live on the North Coast) and my stations come in crystal clear. It is pretty easy to use too. All you need to do is pick your home state(or any other state for that matter) and a city and boom, your listening to that station in real time just like it's in your own backyard. There is also an option to make your own station by picking only the music that interests you. That feature I have yet to explore in its entirety, but when I do, I'll perhaps come back and edit this review. Until then, get this app and enjoy your music! And, one more thing: It's FREE! You'd be denying yourself if you don't at least give it a try. If you don't like it, delete it. Happy Listening from the North Coast!"
iHeartRadio,love itã€‚ï__(^o^)ï_è,EliseMarie,12-Feb-16,5,I love it because  i get to play littel games and listen to it it makes me wanna dance when i win my friends listen to it and really got me in to it the first place
iHeartRadio,Great app for all music lovers,demickey,30-May-17,5,I enjoy this app and love the fact I can find stations that still have a DJ that is educated about the type of music their station plays. I also enjoy listening to stations from a variety of cities. I like how they also have the ability to play artist stations too.
iHeartRadio,Amazing!,Ryan Duffy,17-Sep-13,5,"This app is not only incredible because its simple and entertaining. But because my favorite Radio Show is Elvis Duran and he is on there for me everyday. I only get to listen to the show for 45 minutes to an hour and so I rely ok n I Heart to play his shows, later after work I get to enjoy all of it.  I just appreciate your app and love the system. Thanks for making something as unique and a awesome app that has every single type of music, it has a variety of different elements that make it better than Pandora.Thanks again  Ryan D. DuffyP.S. I need to add that the Amazon Customer Service Reps answering the phones (anytime day or NIGHT!) Are so professional, personable, and fast. Every time I've had an issue with my Kindle, Amazon has called me immediately and done everything they could to not only fix the problem but they show you thing's you may not of known about your Kindle and how to maneuver the apps and programs to make it suit your every day needs. They've never got impatient, sarcastic, or acted like someone needing help is a waste of their time. They are genuine and I can't say enough good things about my experiences. I myself am in the Customer Service industry and when someone treats me like there talking to a friend not a customer I want to continue to use and purchase whatever I may need from them and tell all my friends, family or business how great and easy Amazon is.  Thanks for your hard work and dedication to helping customer  Ryan D. Duffy"
iHeartRadio,Great If You Want To Listen To Their Choice,PHX Ray,30-Apr-16,1,"When it works, its wonderful. When it doesn't, its maddening.IHeart is constantly loading stations into the FOR YOU section. You cannot turn that off, even by de-selecting any favorites in their list of station offerings. No one thought to activate the SAVE button to stop suggestions. Its as if they don't think you have the intelligence to search for new options.The favorites I have in MY STATIONS include about 40 that I cannot delete, nor do I want. And they like to randomly change order so that when I go to a favorite, I have to search all over for it among dozens that I would like to clear out. That's a pain. There should ALWAYS be a delete option available.In terms of use on a phone, occasionally you need to stop IHeart to use another phone function like a text or photograph and quite often, IHeart will shutdown halfway through a podcast and you'll be unable to find that episode to resume. Its as if it thinks you heard part of it and quit it because you didn't want to hear it anymore. The ability to select from different talk radio episodes is hit or miss. Sometimes it gives you a choice, often it shows no options, even though your were just there 30 seconds ago and IHeart shut down on you. That is a royal pain if the episodes button does not include previous and unheard shows. Those options should remain for a period, like 7 days.Also, the changeover from WiFi to roaming data acquisition is wanky and sometimes you miss a bunch of the segment as you walk away from your house.All-in-all its loaded with really juvenile functions that remind me of ""jiggle play"" on the early iPods. If the programmers would simply allow the user to streamline the product to suit their needs without trying to cram unwanted content into the user's experience, they would appeal to more people. I barely have enough time to get caught up to the stations I want to listen to. When the clunky-wanky program interferes with that aim, the user has a less than pleasurable experience. After trying to correct or re-load the app on my Android phone, I finally deleted it all-together and will search for another solution without feature bloat. Software serves the user. Not the other way around."
iHeartRadio,I like other states radio stations,Alexander Naudus,27-Jul-17,5,I like this app because I'm able to listen to my favorite radio stations that I can't receive through regular FM stations out of my surrounding areas. I like to listen to Virginia and south Carolina and Ohio stations and Raleigh stations.
iHeartRadio,iHeart Radio,leedle leedle,18-Sep-13,5,"I LOVE THIS APP!!! You can do tons of stuff with the email address account , or even without signing in at all; those people who say they have to delete their app just because they don't have a Facebook don't know what they're talking about. You do have a limit on how many times you can skip songs, but you can listen forever, and the skips reset the next day. There are commercials but JUST right before the station starts playing, and they're only thirty seconds long. They don't have every radio station available, but you can find your favorite artist/band and make them into their own station so you can listen anytime you want. I also love that you can exit the app and it will still play! And that you can choose if you want the most popular songs by a singer/band, or want to hear music that you might not have heard before. An unbelievably AWESOME app."
iHeartRadio,"the best radio app and their ""the standard"" station i enjoy ...",eric fleming,17-Sep-17,5,"the best radio app and their ""the standard"" station i enjoy frequently.  it's also nice that alexa links to the app so i can just say: ""alexa, play iheart radio the standard"" and instantly i'm listening to frank, dean and tony."
iHeartRadio,iHeart for Amazon Fire. functional for the Silk browser ...,S. Fahey,7-Aug-17,4,"iHeart for Amazon Fire . functional for the Silk browser, Just remember on the Amazon Fire when you check your email, it closes the Silk Browser.A functional app to listen to iHeart radio stations. My iHeart station of choice is Houston KTRH 740 AM"
iHeartRadio,Great Music!,C. Napier,22-Apr-14,5,Love iHeartRadio .. Such a great place to listen to wonderful music when you have the Kindle turned on.  My son is now in the habit of realizing that his time is up when the Christian music turns off .. then it is time for him to turn off the Kindle.  Works good to not just shut off like the Kid-Time programming .. but allows him to make better choices .. sort of like 'musical chairs' with music to tell him to get off from playing games.  Truly enjoy finding music from the past (I'm an 80s gal .. love older music) plus finding my favorite Christian stations to keep me inspired and fulfilled in God's wonderful words by song.
iHeartRadio,Listen to what you want to hear.,NANCY,2-Aug-16,5,Was on a bus tour and one of the gals had this on. Never heard of it till that day. Love the channels I can pick. I'm an oldie goldee. I even have it on my Amazon Alexa just ask to play the channel and you listening.
iHeartRadio,LOVE IT,Kelby Donnelly,3-Jul-16,5,LOVE this app.  Used Pandora until it glitched and I found this.  I can actually use the alarm clock on my kindle.  It personalizes your music by asking what u do and don't like.  U can make ur own stations and I just love it.  U should totally try this app.
iHeartRadio,more commercials lately,Publius,15-Dec-13,2,"I deleted Pandora because of the commercials.  I tolerated them on IHR because they only ever seemed to come up when I logged in and they were infrequent.  Lately, it seems like every time I log in and whenever I switch stations.  I tolerated the UI change a few months ago because I had to.  I tolerated the repetition that threatened to kill songs like Lodi through endless repetition and the songs that don't belong on the station no matter where the dial is set because I ASSumed that they were collecting data on my skips and thumbs down and would improve.  I tolerated the skip limit because I figured Clear Channel would just say something dismissive like 'use your iPod' if I complained(oh, wait...I did!) so I just figured I'd look for a paid version.  It didn't come up(at least not conspicuously) and I lost patience just like when I try to sit through eternal and irritating commercials because I want to hear Bill Handel.  That's why I only listen to KUSC any more.  Congrats, Clear Channel; you drove a head of cattle away from the chute!  You get a second star for helping me wake up."
iHeartRadio,Commercials are very limited and it's also great for discovering new artist related to artist you already ...,Brandy Hough,31-Dec-15,5,This is my atf music app. Commercials are very limited and it's also great for discovering new artist related to artist you already like.It has local radio stations and I can even listen to radio stations from other areas .It also has an alarm clock feature and sleep timer you can set so you can listen while getting ready for bed and it shuts off at set time.Overall this is an exceptional app
iHeartRadio,"IHeart doez what I want it to do, give me a way to leave tv.",Ramblin' Bill,25-Jun-17,5,"I'm new to I Heart Radio, but it is allowing me to listen to my news stations, who actually report the news, rather than conjure it up.  And the music is perfect.  Leaving tv and returning to radio!  I Heart seems to work for me!"
iHeartRadio,"Good app, a few glitches",Mrs. C,16-Nov-12,4,"Overall this is a really great app. I would have given it five stars except there are a couple of things that bug me about it (using it on my Kindle fire).  For one is the commercial you are forced to listen to every time to power the app up.  It's fairly short, so it's sufferable, but it's still annoying.  The other thing is that the radio will just go off for no reason.  You'll be listening and then all of a sudden nothing.  Also, I was a bit confused by the ""create your own station"" aspect of the app. I typed in one of my fav. singers and thought it would play just his songs, but it didn't, it plays anyone that is a similar genre, which is okay, just was not what I expected.  The app is great especially since it's free and you can take your radio station anywhere in the house with you, which is nice if you don't have good radio reception."
iHeartRadio,Good for general listening,Douglas Mahn,29-Jul-17,5,"I use it every day.I just wish the categories would stick to their artists.If I type in 'Weird Al', I want to listen to non-stop Al - I don't want to listen to Cake or 3 Doors Down (the actual bands, not Al's parody)"
iHeartRadio,used to be ok..but now?,Scarlet~Witch,11-Jul-15,2,"Too many adverts, to many dumb adverts, half the time I turn it off an listen to regular over the air radio.  It's gone to the dogs. Yeah , love the stations, but it never plays consistently. So..I plan to find a paid app for music n drop iheartradio like a hot potato."
iHeartRadio,Not perfect but couldn't live without it.,Jameson Thompson,30-Aug-17,4,"I don't know what I'd do without this. My favorite talk radio host, Drew Garabo does a show on Tampa's ""THE BONE"" radio. If it wasn't for IHeart I would not be able to listen to him. I do wish they would play me more local ads and take advantage of their ability to run over stations ads but sadly they don't do this enough. I also wish it had some more options like other streaming music apps but I can't really complain"
iHeartRadio,SIX Stars For This!,Simone &#10084;,30-Dec-16,5,"This is a wonderful app! I have heard everyone talk about it, so I finally got it. It is AMAZING. It is add free, and streams any music youy can think of! There's a lot, but everyone has already said it in there reviews, soooooo.....Anyway, if you are a music lover who likes listening to the best music, I âù_ Radio is your solution."
iHeartRadio,Great App,Vickie G.,11-Dec-16,5,I've been finding all kinds of music I had forgotten about. I just found a genuine oldies station out of Minneapolis that plays music from the 50's and 60's. I live in Georgia so this is the only way for me to tune in to this great music.  XM radio is too expensive on my retirement income.
iHeartRadio,love it!,teenamarie,13-Dec-12,5,i purchased this app mos ago...after reading the earlier reviews i have decided to update those who are not aware of this app...well i love it!!!.. i listen while at work and at home...you do not have to sign in to facenook or any other social media sites to access this app...just simply click on the not now button and your in..i also just did the update for the app and it has some new features on it...i would reccomend this app!
iHeartRadio,LOVE this app,Anne Perry,2-Apr-16,5,"LOVE this app! It's turned my Kindle Fire 5th Generation 2015 tablet into a portable radio. I can listen to my favorite music stations & all of my favorite talk shows. If you sign up for a FREE, no-hassle account, then you can customize your stations."
iHeartRadio,Doesn't make available any local actual radio stations.,David Findtner,20-May-16,2,"When it says it provides all your favorite radio stations, you hope what it provides is local radio stations as well.  I had never heard of any of what they provide and it seems a bit limited.  Guess I'll go buy a little actual radio, if they are still available."
iHeartRadio,Listen Anywhere,Amazon Customer,21-Aug-17,5,"No longer use my Sangean Radio at night. Not matter where I am in the country, as long as I have WiFi access, I can listen to my favorite radio stations. Works great using my Amazon Fire HD tablet."
iHeartRadio,Amazing Quality and Very Well Designed!,HopieIsabella,22-Feb-14,5,"This app lets you play your favorite music within the touch of a button... literally. Comparing it to such other apps like Pandora, I think it is almost as well designed with some features poorly thought of an  others superb! For example, this app includes an alarm clock and sleep time. Pandora on the other hand let  you add variety to your stations. . Although this app could be better, I strongly recommend it to anyone in need of their own variety of music."
iHeartRadio,Greatest thing since sliced bread,Amazon Customer,6-Jun-16,5,"I love it, love it, love it! It's a great app to have. I  work strange hours. So, I can listen to my show's podcast anytime."
iHeartRadio,Makes my work day better!,STACEY,18-Sep-16,5,Addicted to this service.  Last year I started listening to the Santa Fe & Alaska radio/news and it helped me to get a better feel for the area before we visited.  I love the commercial free stations and the choices.  I listen all day at work being we have poor radio reception in our building.
iHeartRadio,Finding K-LOVE,Boots 38,22-Jul-16,3,"I got on it for K-Love.  but it was in Spanish!  In order to get it in English, I have to go to the Alexis app, type in the city and state and scroll to the K-LOVE station.  Too much ""work""!"
iHeartRadio,Great music app,Frederick McCollim,27-Sep-17,5,"If you love music, this is the app for you! It's a great music app and you can find almost any song! I recommend you to download this app, it's great!"
iHeartRadio,give me beats,shawnte jaynes,6-Jan-17,5,"this is how i listen to my new york stations... we now get my station in my city so i can listen to it in the car if im up that early.... however, i can rock the station and adele through my tv when im cleaning up or working.... will continue to use"
iHeartRadio,"FREE MUSIC, yes please",Plant Based Karen,4-Mar-16,5,I love this app. I can no longer hear Prince on Amazon Prime so I listen here. I also love that I can take NPR with me into work.
iHeartRadio,Everything a person could imagine and more. Nothing else on the market compares.,Speed,20-May-15,5,"I've been using iHeart Radio for over a year and nothing else comes close to being as good. You get it all and more with this one app. Everyone should give iHeart Radio a fair chance cause there is no way you can be disappointed. No commercial ( or very limited commercials) by limited I mean one when you begin your listening experience and the rest of the time yours to enjoy.  So come on give it a go and tell all your friends and family. No matter what your listening to they have it, from all the new releases to the old hard to find and everything in between."
iHeartRadio,Didn't perform for me,T Walters,29-Oct-15,2,"When my Tunein radio app got stubborn, I decided to try this one. It could not find my local NPR station, even with a search of the exact call sign. General searches were no use either. I didn't bother investing any more time in it. There may be features that I did not investigate to make it work better. I just wasn't motivated to bother. TuneIn is much easier to use for my purposes (when it works)."
iHeartRadio,Joe Pags fan!,Knitting Granma,13-Nov-15,5,"Downloaded this specifically to get the Joe Pags radio show -- after our local station replaced his show with a zero interest talk show.  Am able to hear it easily, and have had several bonuses.  Heard the latest Republican debate clearly; have picked up other news and sports programs that I can't get either locally or televised, since I don't have cable TV.  This app is defintely worth putting on your phone."
iHeartRadio,I love iHeartRadio. When ever I am traveling I can ...,no name,18-Mar-17,5,I love iHeartRadio.  When ever I am traveling I can listen to my favorite channel.
iHeartRadio,Great music,Cari,4-Jul-16,5,A really great app for all kinds of music and my favorite radio stations
iHeartRadio,Love my iHeartRadio,Sharon Kiesel,2-Mar-16,5,"My son got this for me because locally, my favorite two daytime radio shows on our local station was really coming in statically after the station changed broadcasting methods. So, I was given iHeartRadio and now, can hear my favorite programs through a Florida station instead of our local one. So clear. Fun to hear the FL weather and the ads too!"
iHeartRadio,Satisfactory,Grizmeister57,23-Oct-15,3,This app needs serious fixing.  I surf the web and the music stops and the ads they cram in your ear get stuck in your head and get redundant.  They cut in to your tunes to show you the same ad you seen A FEW Minutes ago.  / They need to cut it out if they want to be bumped to a B.  Or I might as well give I heart a D- right now.
iHeartRadio,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!,G. D. Whitfield,4-May-16,5,"This is wonderful! The music choices I wanted, I found; jazz is my favorite form of music...there is so much to choose from, I was stunned. I was even able to get old-time radio shows. This app doesn't just stop, then buffer, then nothing. The sound quality is excellent and you don't have to constantly adjust volume levels."
iHeartRadio,Excellent app for listening to your favorite station,Ruby S.,19-Jul-13,5,"I came across this app when I saw it on the website of my favorite radio station. I grew up in Southern California and there was one station that I've been listening to since high school. Unfortunately, I ended up moving out of the county and couldn't get the station on the radio. Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD. Personally, I don't bother with logging into Facebook because I have no interest in creating my own stations. I prefer listening to live radio and like that I can choose any station in the country that they offer."
iHeartRadio,All I need,Andrew T. Culjak,12-Sep-17,5,My only issue with this app is the same for all similar apps - the sometimes broad swath taken in providing like artists or music on the station.  When I listen to chopin i don't want to hear polkas or chopin jovi.  This is ameliorated with the thumbs up or down buttons and the app quickly adjusts.
iHeartRadio,Best Free Radio App!,Bob P Wilson,26-Oct-16,5,"Five Stars!  Who doesn't love free music and radio?  I've used iHeart Radio since it was first introduced and continue to use the app today.  I love that iHeart Radio works across all of my Android Devices, Phone, Tablets, Laptops and Especially my Alexa Controlled Devices!"
iHeartRadio,Love it,Shelia,18-Feb-13,5,"I love iHeartRadio because it allows me to listen to my favorite radio station Power 105.1 The Breakfast Club.  Since I'm in a different state, I wouldn't be able to listen if it wasn't for iHeart.  I also have some other stations that I love listening too.  My local stations aren't that good so I definitely appreciate iHeartRadio."
iHeartRadio,Needs a few improvements,KS,7-Dec-12,3,"Overall, I like this app better than Pandora because I couldn't get Pandora to work for very long on my Kindle Fire HD. IHeart Radio allows you to create your own station, however...once you select an artist you like, it only plays one song from that artist and then moves on to some other artist. If my station is created by clicking on a particular artist, I would expect ALL songs to be from that same artist. Also, the app kept shutting down or freezing up on me recently. I was able to get it going again, but only after it closed by itself about 4 or 5 times, so there are obviously issues with it. It would be nice to have more stations to choose from as well, especially for California. Most of the stations were East Coast (New York) based stations. Otherwise, once it plays it's great for a free app."
iHeartRadio,Iheart is great for when you want to listen to music on ...,Jeannie,5-Feb-17,5,Iheart is great for when you want to listen to music on your computer while your working. Alexa even plays Iheart great. Iheart app can even be added to your cell phone so when you go jogging or exercising you can take your music with you.
iHeartRadio,Nice,K.,25-Oct-16,4,"Love it! Just wish I could listen without WiFi, and that i can ""thumbs up"" a song after it ended/ view previous songs like with Pandora"
iHeartRadio,Great App! Perfect for fangirls!,dev lugs 5sos,20-Jun-16,5,"I can say, this app is way better than Pandora and Spotify mixed together, plays all my favourite music.:) Really great for when you are a hard core fangirl."
iHeartRadio,Better than being forced to listen to the same ol..,Southwest,27-Oct-17,4,Like it. It's still too early to do a full review but opted for the cheapest option. I like that I now have a more personalized music list and sometimes listen to my phone in the car instead of constantly pushing buttons on my stereo. This and the last remaining indie station in my area is what I will be staying with.
iHeartRadio,I,Michelle Johnston,28-Aug-17,5,IT IS SOOO GOOOOOOOOD
iHeartRadio,iNOTradio,Brittney,3-Feb-16,1,"App doesn't work! Horrible! Don't download! I tried creating a new account and get a message saying ""Sorry you are eligible you create a account"" also tried clicking ""Forgot password"" and that didn't work! Doesn't make sense! Customer service is NO help! I wouldn't recommend this ii anyone!"
iHeartRadio,Horrible,FalleNMpathAngel,24-Jul-17,1,"Worst app ever. I can't go online while I have this app open without it shutting itself off. I can't use my Kindle (I'm using an Amazon Fire tablet) to read any of my books without this app shutting itself off. I can't play games, I can't do anything else on my tablet without this app shutting itself off. I've had the same issues on my PC and smartphone, so I know it isn't just my tablet."
iHeartRadio,Awesome music app!,Tawnya,9-Dec-16,5,"This app is AWESOME for listening to music! I have no problem with other apps like Pandora, but this app is better (in my opinion) It is very easy to use. It has so many stations and songs. I wish it didn't need internet to listen to, but that isn't worth bringing down the 5 star rating over."
iHeartRadio,Perfection,Tabi,9-Nov-13,5,"I know a lot of people say they like all kinds of music, then go on to list only a few kinds. I am one of those that truly loves all music. This app is absolutely amazing for any kind of music lover though! I love that I can listen to 60's hits for a while then switch over to pop and finish up with a little country. Later maybe some soft rock and then blues and hey why not a bit of jazz.It has enough to make anyone get excited about music and keep you dancing all day long.The alarm features are perfect and the fact that I can listen to music while reading an ebook at the same time on my kindle is awesome!"
iHeartRadio,I have been trying to use the app for the ...,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-17,1,I have been trying to use the app for the last two months and it keeps telling me that it is unable to function. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no positive results. I really miss my music. I use this app when I do my walks.
iHeartRadio,Love Heart radio...,MinPinMom,26-Sep-17,5,Great music selection !!!  A breeze to set up...thanks Heart radio...
iHeartRadio,great for streaming music,rach,3-Apr-16,5,"I use this app frequently. I love how easy it is to create a radio station. You can even change up what types of songs it offers you if you start hearing the same ones all the time by having it play by tuning the station to play top hits, mix or variety. I wish the amazon music app was set up more like this one."
iHeartRadio,couldnt ever use it,K. DeLuca,6-Jan-12,1,"As soon as I installed this aPP my phone slowed down, started freezing, behaved erratically, etc. I couldn't even listen to a station because it took me over 20 minutes to type in anything. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Same problems. What a waste of time."
iHeartRadio,Works,Gary D. Scott,1-Aug-17,5,"Works fine on my BB Z30. Too bad IHeart is having financial troubles, makes them stuff my favorite stations full of now video ads before connecting."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio Steps Up Their Game,Raphael Sanchez,7-Aug-14,5,"Z100 is my favorite, one and a kind radio station. They just took themselves to another level. You know the crew, Greg T., Bethany, all of em'. Now you got em at your fingertips as long as you got WI-FI. You can listen to all your favorite songs while at the gym, or even at your office. This is one app to get! Yes, it's free people. See why we like iHeartRadio? Also, you got a variety of other radio stations like 'Moves That Swagger Radio'. You can even look up different artists to see if they have a station like 'Nico and Vinz Radio', and you can build your own custom station. Now stop being amazed and get this app! Prepare to be bopping your head."
iHeartRadio,Not bad,watchman,29-May-14,4,"I heard good things about this app, so I downloaded it. I like that you can listen to some live music channels without having to log into Facebook or an email account. But it seems that if you want to customize at all what channels you want to listen to, it forces you to log in to Facebook or an email account, which I usually don't feel like going to all the bother to do. So my selection of music is limited due to that. Usually I just like to open apps and use them without going into another account. But it is a free app at least, which is good."
iHeartRadio,Awesome!!,speegle,8-Sep-16,5,"You couldn't ask for better. Customized music anywhere, anytime and no blips. Incredible!!!I use it,my daughters use it.We use it for parties and more!It's not just music to us now, it's a part of our lifestyle, lol!"
iHeartRadio,GREAT!,rlnappi,21-Apr-17,5,I use this will driving in my car from state to state.  That way I don't lose the station I'm listening too.  I can start a trip in NJ and end up in CA and never touch the radio.GREAT!
iHeartRadio,Great App.,KLR,4-Dec-14,4,"I like it more than I wanted to, and I use it more than I thought I would. Great music for free, with commercials few and far between. My one warning, when you type and artist/band name, for a personalized radio, you don't just get that artist, you get that and any artist similar....Which is a pro or con depending upon your musical preferences. I find it a pro because I find music I might not have found otherwise, but I can see how it could be a con for some. easy to use."

iHeartRadio,Lame.,Abbott,31-May-14,1,"This apps interface is so obstructed with pop up ads and garbage that it is pretty much worthless. The controls for the app are unintuitive to the point of annoyance. I accidentally triggered a station with a disagreeable format and the only way I could stop it playing in a reasonable timeframe was to delete the app. No great loss, there are hundreds of better options for musical enjoyment. Skip it altogether; ClearChannel will need to work a little harder to maintain relevance."
iHeartRadio,Slow startup,willard groover,20-Mar-17,4,"slow to load, after it is load it works well"
iHeartRadio,Can delete explicit material in settings : ),Kindle Customer,28-Sep-15,5,"Able to choose my own settings, unlike Spotify. I tried Spotify for one day and realized that if I pick a genre, probably 30% of what they stream is explicit content that I could NOT take off. The first thing I checked on iHeartRadio was if I could deny explicit content, and I could. I'm telling all of my decent, clean minded friends to go with iHeartRadio!"
iHeartRadio,I enjoy the convenience of finding the radio stations that I ...,HERB,17-Apr-17,5,I enjoy the convenience of finding the radio stations that I like. The only problem is that I sometimes hear the same commercial 5 to 6 times in a row on wabc talk radio.
iHeartRadio,"Not the best radio app for a Kindle, but it's OK.",Eusebius,13-Mar-15,3,"A decent app, but not the very best for radio listening.  It does load quickly on a Kindle HD but the interface is a little clunky and takes too much user action to search and the station list, domestic and international, is very small compared to other services.Recommended stations automatically pop up and the developers should take a look at whatever algorithm they use for this feature because most of the stations recommended for me are way off the mark when compared to the stations I have been selecting. It's frustrating.Icons and text are a size geared more for smartphone screens rather than Kindle screens. For a Kindle, it would be more efficient and easier to use if they were smaller."
iHeartRadio,"I got this for my Kindle Fire, and it ...",Denise Schilling,15-Aug-16,5,"I got this for my Kindle Fire, and it works well.  Even though I bought an AM antenna, I can't get AM radio in my apartment.  Now I can play my radio talk shows while I work around the house."
iHeartRadio,I think you will be quite happy,sideroadusa,26-Sep-16,4,I didn't give it a five as there are a lot of good applications out on the market. truly it can easily rate a five in most cases. I do like the app quite well and use it often.iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio

I can't wait to see if it works this great at other locations I frequent in the Philippines and Thailand.  THANKS!
iHeartRadio,TRICIA,TRICIA,22-Aug-13,5,LOVE THIS PURCHASE. OLD SCHOOL PERSON SONG BRING BACK MEMORIES.EASY TO SETUPAND YOU GET TO PICK YOUR OWN STATIONS.
iHeartRadio,Love it,S. Walker,18-Feb-13,5,Love this app! I tried using another music app and it crashed every time. I haven't had any problems with Iheartradio radio app. I listen to a radio station that I grew up listening to at home.
iHeartRadio,it's ok,johndoe,22-Sep-17,3,"its super choppy, its always stopping and starting, and sometimes i have to press play again, but i can't find anything better."
iHeartRadio,Excellent alternative to Pandora,Amazon Customer,7-Apr-14,5,"This is an excellent alternative to Pandora and runs perfectly on my BlackBerry Z10...unlike the third party 'Apollo' app for Pandora. I still prefer the musical experience of Pandora better, but the option to listen to broadcast Radio is somewhat attractive. One thing that became a frustration was the enormous amount of commercial minutes aired each hour on broadcast Radio. After listening to Pandora for several years I became accustomed to commercial free music. I don't care to listen to 20 minutes of commercials every hour."
iHeartRadio,love being able to listen to my farvorite stations when not around home,RD,2-Feb-13,5,this is a great app with great stations . i like that you can listen to your favorite stations when you are out of town . very good app
iHeartRadio,"Very clear channels, even the AM channels!",Bella,7-Dec-13,5,Clear radio even AM! I can't believe how clear the channels are even for AM channels which if you use a regular radio will know that AM channels don't come in that clear. I like that I can listen to any station in the country which is awesome because I have found some interesting stations that play all the music that I like. It's also nice when traveling and you want to listen to a station from back home.
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio,mimi,15-Sep-17,5,I love this app. I can listen to my oldies anytime I want. You can listen to any kind of music you like anytime you like.
iHeartRadio,great,riahg94,24-Apr-16,5,Plays great music and leaves off where I left it
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio is great.,Hope,7-Dec-12,5,"I live and work in an area where the radio stations are few and they talk alot.I work in a metal building and the radio stations are very finicky about coming in and hanging thru the day.I was using Pandora and I didn't mind them having an occasional commercial, but it totally locks up on commercials and I lose my music.  Very annoying.  I'm constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial.  So I downloaded iHeart.  it's great.  It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle, but so far it was well worth it and it didn't cost anything to download the app thru Amazon.  You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account, but it works great.  I recommend it.  I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."
iHeartRadio,Not Like the Desktop,L. Werner,15-Jan-13,3,"Good, like that I can still get my stations when I am in a store, etc.  However, I am frustrated with the ""Save Station"" issue.  I have saved my home stations (like I do on my desktop computer) but can't call them back up to switch over.  The ""Stations"" tab is annoyingly blank.  Also need to remember call letters for stations and it's harder to search by area station is in.  Just received an update today, so we'll see how it works out...This was originally downloaded to my new smartphone (where I have had the problems).  I recently downloaded it to my Kindle, but haven't had time to play with it much to see if it just needs a bigger screen than on my phone."
iHeartRadio,keep it _Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’¯_Ÿ’_,Amazon Customer,22-Apr-16,5,I love this app so much and I really like how u can pick the category so who ever created this app they should get first place and even money
iHeartRadio,Great app. I am really loving iHeart,Lisa Steinmetz,2-Oct-17,5,Great app. I am really loving iHeart. The only thing I can do without is the live shows. I'm not a fan of those at all.
iHeartRadio,I like the idea behind this product - i,Jerald T.,19-Sep-16,4,"I like the idea behind this product - i.e., being able to select the type of music you like to hear by sampling different tracks and then giving a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down to each.  It sure is a lot cheaper than going out and buying the CD's!"
iHeartRadio,I use it a lot!,Kindle Customer,21-Feb-14,4,"I can find so many great streams, many of my favorite radio stations and local ones I didn't know existed. They even have talk shows! I find myself listening to Science Friday all the time.Their personalization is fantastic! If you have ever used Pandora, you may be familiar with how far off ""similiar"" they can track. iHeartRadio quickly adjusts to your likes and dislikes. I have found many more artists that I enjoy but have never heard of through this app.Only downside is that I can't view individual songs that I have favorited in the past. It may just be me, but I am pretty good at navigating software."
iHeartRadio,"Love it, but...",Molly,16-Sep-15,4,"Okay, so I love this app with all of my heart, BUT I have some issues with it. No it doesn't lag, doesn't shut down on me, etc, but it DOES make me watch an ad before I can listen. That's my first pet peeve with this. The second one is the fact that I have a SKIP. LIMIT. It annoys me so much, I can't stand it. I have several customized stations, and the thing is, if there's a song I don't like or I actually want to get to a song by the band/artist, I can't. Why? SKIP LIMIT. why is the skip limit a thing?Overall, a decent app. The sound quality is good, there are no commercials in between each song on the customized stations, and it's easy to use. This app and I have somewhat of a love/hate relationship."
iHeartRadio,Not as Advertised but it's free,Fran Chadwick,8-Jan-14,2,The pop-up ad on my Kindle Fire said there were hundreds of radio stations.  So far I've found about 6 different KISS or KIIS FM stations from various large cities and none of them play any of the music I want to hear.  I'll probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I'm not hopeful.  At least the ap (and the usage) are free so I've only wasted my time at worst.  Note - I thought each radio station had to have a unique call sign but apparently things have changed with the internet age.
iHeartRadio,Confusing to use,Amazon Customer,22-Mar-17,1,Very confusing to use plus I realised I didn't really need it since I use Amazon Prime Music.
iHeartRadio,I love iHeart Radio,tessy,18-Jul-17,5,"I love iHeartRadio, the music is everything. I can put it on and know my type of music will be played and it meets all my expectations. Keep the music coming"
iHeartRadio,Works Great,Barbara,16-Feb-13,5,Love this on my new Kindle HD.  Great choices and great reception. Would recommend this App to anyone.  I really enjoy it.
iHeartRadio,Local station for The Big Show,Mario C. Elia,4-Jan-13,4,"I don't like the hard rock played on the local  iHeart station, or any station for that matter. But the local Columbus, Georgia,,,and surrounding Alabama..station 103 (102.9) runs the John Boy and Billy. ""Big Show"" 6 days a week from 6am to 10 am EST. And I faithfully listen to the show. I can get it on my Android phone and iPad as well! So I rate a four star to  iHeart for having the programming flexibility for airing the Big Show. Other people I know say the same and that iHeart should suspend the hard rock during the Big Show. And then they can pick it up after the Big Show audience has turned off the station.....because they have. And the hard rockers can have their music back for 20 hours and all day Sunday, when the Big Show is not broadcast!"
iHeartRadio,Finally!!! _Ÿ˜‰,McBadger23,13-Mar-15,5,I love this app.... minus two things... one the app has a limited number of skips ( witch means I can't skip songs that cuss) and 2 when I pause it the app thinks that I am skipping the song...switch means I have missed Pompeii twice!!!! That's my third or second fave song!!!!! All out her wise it is a good app... oh and you have to rate the song as it's playing or else it goes as unrated! I love the lyrics feature! Now airhead know so many songs.... PS it plays songs again for the better or for the worse... yeah... take that how u want.
iHeartRadio,Old school audiophile.,dennis reed,7-Sep-17,5,"All gets better all the time. Looks great _Ÿ‘ç ,very easy to use. Among the top five best music players period!"
iHeartRadio,I <3 iHeart Radio ;),Grace,2-Aug-14,5,"I LOVE iHeart Radio!! It is a great app with great music! I love that you can stream live radio from the app, especially because this way I can listen to my fav radio stations wherever I am, regardless of whether there is a tower nearby. My ONLY complaint, and it is little, is that when you are making a custom station, you can't add more than one band or artist to add more variety. But I also have Pandora, which does do that, so it is not a big deal. Overall, I highly recommend this app!!"
iHeartRadio,Cool app,TxMomoftwo,13-Jan-14,5,"Looking for an app to listen to music on my Kindle and decided to give this one a try. It has a couple of different features that I haven't tried like an alarm clock but it does have a couple different radio stations.  Not tons of stations just a couple from across the country in each different genre of music.  It does have a comedy channel.  For a free app it doesn't have lots of commercials, but every 5 minutes or so you'll get a 5 second commercial. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a way to play radio on your kindle."
iHeartRadio,Pandora Is Better,Book6,25-Sep-15,3,"Not nearly as good as Pandora. I think iHearRadio claims to have more songs in their library than Pandora, but I don't see how that's true.  I listened to one of their pre-made stations- not a live radio feed- and heard a couple songs repeat in a few hours.  I never have that with Pandora.  That being said, it is nice to have the additional variety of pre-made stations available beyond the genre stations on Pandora.  iHearRadio is a good compliment to Pandora, but if this was the only internet ""radio"" available I would think that internet radio is lame."
iHeartRadio,Selction of live radio channels is disappointing,southbaygal,26-Dec-14,2,"Very limited selection of live channels.  I am unable to select the radio channels I listen to such as my local PBS channels.  The classic rock statin I listen to also can't be selected.  I wanted to use IHeart Radio on my TV in my living room because the radio reception, especially for AM radio, in my area is really  terrible.  I was also not able to find certain talk show hosts on IHeart radio either.  Very disappointing."
iHeartRadio,Great app!!!,Latrice,19-Sep-13,4,"I love this app. It gives you different radio station to listen to. Even the ones outside your local station. It's easy to use. You can save your favorite channels and there's a search box to look for specific ones. The two cons for me are the commercials that comes on when the station is first turned on, in addition to the commercials that comes on with the regular radio stations,  but it's only for less than a minute so that's ok and that it only works using WiFi or internet access. With this being a free app and it being convenient on my kindle fire and tmobile phone I can't complain. I will give it a five star if those two cons were pro. It's still a great app though :)"
iHeartRadio,best!!!!!,Jon,25-Dec-15,5,"If you love music but you can't seem to find a app that knows what you like, you're in luck! This app has tons of the music that you love and the amazing part is this app is free! If you are looking at these comments to help you understand if you want to download this app, I am telling you, get iHeartRadio!!!!"
iHeartRadio,Great!,Caity C.,13-May-16,5,"I love the app.  Never glitches like my Spotify app, and I can listen to music of my favorite stations, combined with other songs from other artists. The dependability, five stars, sound: five stars, and running time: five stars. I recommend if you like finding new music and listening to the radio"
iHeartRadio,Sorry. Not as good as Pandora. Needs work.,karen crowley,24-Apr-17,1,It doesn't provide lyrics. No way to find out what previous songs played (when I miss a couple). It doesn't even tell you about the artists.
iHeartRadio,Looking for classical music?,T. Sloan,15-Jan-17,3,"I downloaded this app so I could listen to the blaze radio, but i have found other stations that I enjoy, particularly classical music, which is very difficult to find on the local radio."
iHeartRadio,Great Radio App,R. Toro,25-Apr-12,5,"This App works well! You can listen to your favorite radio stations through your cell phone or tablet! I love to be able to switch from the radio in my car, to continue listening on my phone when I get somewhere. Also, if you are out of town, or have a favorite station in a city that you used to live in, you can access those stations through this app!It works a lot better now than it did when initially released. I have very few problems with it. It usually builds up a slight delay from the actual radio station, but that just allows you to skip some commercials if you restart it at the beginning of a commercial break!I highly recommend this app to people that enjoy listening to radio stations without interruptions after leaving their car or home!"
iHeartRadio,enjoying Iheartradio,Gloria Morgan,19-Nov-12,4,"I wish I could get more local stations.  I listen to Cleveland and Houston because they have the programs I want to hear.  I live in Oregon.  Also when I click on Elvis Radio or Beatles radio, I wanted to hear them, and only one in 3-10 songs is what I wanted.  I have learned you have to ""program"" the stations to eventually play what you are wanting to hear.  I thought Elvis radio would play Elvis.  No so.  the first 10 songs you might get 3 Elvis then not again for 10 or more songs.  BOO!  It is a fun oldies station, but not what I was expecting.  I am working on ""programing"" it now but takes a while.  Same with the other stations, Beatles, etc."
iHeartRadio,I like iHeart. Once I tried it a few days ...,garym,31-Jul-17,5,I like iHeart. Once I tried it a few days in my car and droped my Serius XM service and saved $12 a month.
iHeartRadio,not user friendly,Kat Quilts in GA,8-Jan-14,3,"Granted I haven't used it much. The first time out was to live stream a specific radio station, which seems to be the best use of this app. Or using their pre-built play lists. To me it's not very user friendly when it comes to customizing, and to me the genres and artist lists seem limited. I don't really get their ""mood/activity"" suggestions either. I've been a big Pandora fan for several years, with a paid subscription and I would definitely use Pandora first. I was having some interference issues so I loaded  iHeartRadio to compare and trouble shoot."
iHeartRadio,Works well on Fire HDX tablets & fully integrated with Amazon Echo,Dogs & Horses _Ÿê__Ÿê•_Ÿêˆ,24-Dec-14,5,"This is a pretty impressive free service. We discovered iHeartRadio through our Amazon Echo and now have the app on both of our Fire HDX tablets. The ease of creating a custom station, skipping songs and finding new music is great. The integration with Echo means I no longer have any need for Pandora whatsoever."
iHeartRadio,Awful for podcasts,Jennifer Weiss,2-Aug-17,2,"I used to use iheart daily for my favorite radio show in the morning and later for podcasts. I just downloaded onto my fire tablet, and the radio plays fine, but every time I select a podcast, the app spazzes out and skips, trying to select an episode but not playing any at all. Deleting and redownloading solved nothing. It can be noted that it played a couple podcasts yesterday with no problem."
iHeartRadio,Great!,Darnedifino,12-Nov-16,5,Great for listening to games not broadcast nationally.
iHeartRadio,Great Radio Channel App,Laurafhl,15-Feb-14,5,"I have a Kindle Fire and I was looking for a station that I could listen to Christian music on. This app is perfect for any music but they also have many Contemporary Christian channels and even a 'Make your own' channel where you can enter a musician's name and it will play that person and others like them. I thought that was very cool. Once in a while the station goes blank on me but only on a couple of stations. I don't think it's the app, I think it's the station i'm listening to. It's free and it works very well."
iHeartRadio,I have never downloaded this app or visited this website ...,Sarah,10-Sep-17,1,"I have never downloaded this app or visited this website, but somehow started receiving emails from them about my ""account"". Something malicious is likely afoot."
iHeartRadio,I enjoy it. I wish that there was more variety ...,Margaret,29-Apr-17,4,I listen every morning to The Standard. I enjoy it.  I wish that there was more variety without having to pay the monthly fee.
iHeartRadio,"Music, my first love!",Sandy Rose,17-Sep-17,5,"So far, I like it quite a lot.  I've only been listening for two days, but I'm enjoying it!"
iHeartRadio,Too commerical,Broken Luck,24-Sep-17,3,"(Note: This review is addressed to iHeart.com, not the app.) I have kept my all-Access membership only because it makes the work day go by. There are many features for the listener to follow a song, artist and stations. Unfortunately, iHeart limits its playlist to the most commercially popular songs. So if you play a 60's artists or station, for example, expect to hear the same top 40 stuff as on the radio. This kind of makes the features useless, because the subscriber never gets to discover new music. Stop using fancy algorithms to sell the product, iHeart."
iHeartRadio,What's not to love about this,SCOR13,20-Mar-15,5,"What's not to love about this?! Any genre of music anytime, playlists, and suggestions to enhance your music experience. I love being able to have different music available for whatever mood I'm in, and iHeartRadio makes it so easy...without the hassle of looking through stacks of CDs to find what I want. I wish this had been around years ago! Awesome idea! We love it!!! :-)"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,james d destaso,28-Jul-17,5,"Love listening to radio stations where ever I want. Also, choosing the music I want is great."
iHeartRadio,Not as good as it should be,Russ Adams,9-Mar-13,3,"Ok app, but it limits you to how many times you can change a song from one you don't like to a different one. This means that once you reach your limit you have to listen to a song you might not like. That's not a good thing. Otherwise it's ok..."
iHeartRadio,Doesnt shut down by swiping off the app,ZackPE,21-May-17,1,"Doesn't shut down by swiping the app off. You have to pause the music then swipe it off, if you swipe first, the app sound stays on, then you have to turn it on , pause and swipe off. Very annoying trying to shove it down your throught"
iHeartRadio,All my favorite songs in different radio stations and FREE,Stef1228shark,18-Nov-15,5,"Love listening to my iHeart radio when I am near my Kindle Fire, Smartphone-Tracphone, or using my desk top computer.  Love the stations that you can choose or build your own.  This is a FREE MUSIC app.  I get emails when they have a new station that I might like, but the emails don't go overboard. :-)"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,W. Leigh,22-Sep-17,5,Greatly appreciate the availability ... makes the day go by easier listening to the music.

iHeartRadio,Fills in a Seattle void,zdamaw,30-Oct-17,5,"You'd think a market as big as Seattle would have a lot of variety, but no Blues. We have a Blues show on Saturday and Sunday evenings (knkx.org) but that seems to be it. I can listen to the Strictly Blues all the time - LOVE IT!"

iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio rules!,E. H. P. Killeffer,28-Oct-15,5,"I learned about iHeartRadio through my favorite AM station (WOR in New York) and since I don't have a cell phone, I could never take the station with me when I left the house.  Now I have the whole package and I'm having fun getting acquainted with all the offerings.  And the best part is the app is free!"
iHeartRadio,Not very good.,Casey,31-Mar-12,3,"The iHeartRadio app is okay, but not very good. The custom stations are repetitive and inaccurate compared to Pandora or Slacker. The app lacks the ability to add more artists as seeds. The interface is fast. Too fast. If you are not careful you could end up banning more than one song because it processes a ban so quickly. There is no way to undo it if you do. If it were not for the well implemented streams from real stations I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app is not useful. If you want to listen to the real stations, I would recommend this app. If you just want the custom stations feature, I would recommend Slacker, Pandora, or Jango instead."
iHeartRadio,Would have given this more stars if....,Terese,10-Jan-14,3,"I was able to use the app a little bit but, while I enjoyed it it needs updating  to work on my kindle fire HD.  Started getting a white screen that rapidly turned to an unending black screen.  This won't work unless I used with the 1st loaded station at least I remembered where the pause button was.  It was a nice alarm clock replacement until I received my new owner from Amazon today at least.  Removed today because I wasn't able to delete the alarm I set.  Who wants to wake up at 6:15am on Saturday."
iHeartRadio,New iHeartRadio Fan,MamaLady 808,9-Jan-17,5,I'm a new fan of iHeartRadio!  The stations I had set on Pandora didn't quite have the selections of music I've come to enjoy on iHeartRadio.  I like that there are my local radio stations to choose as well.  Great start to my New Year !!
iHeartRadio,I would love to give it more stars and I know it's ...,Amazon Customer,7-Jun-17,3,"I would love to give it more stars and I know it's widely used but for a somewhat technology challeged person, I am not sure how to correctly use it. It does not appear to have ""help"" features readily available.  I selected several songs yesterday and added them to my playlist but am not able to find (let alone play) it to enjoy the music I have chosen."
iHeartRadio,Love this app,Michael McCullough,13-May-15,5,"Really love this app!!! This app has pretty much any and everything that you could want to listen to. You can type in a certain group that you want to listen to and it will pull up a station just for that group, and the genre of music that it is associated with. Can't stop listening to my favorite station!!!! A very big high recommend to music lovers."
iHeartRadio,MY SEARCH IS OVER,KAREN,2-Mar-14,5,I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR AN APP TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC AND FOR INTERNET RADIO I DOWNLOADED SOME AND ONLY ENDED UP UNINSTALLING THEM THEY DID NOT DO ALL THEY INDICATED NOW IM EXTREMELY PLEASED NOT ONLY DO I HAVE MY MUSIC BUT ALSO RADIO STATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD I LISTEN TO PLUS MY MUSIC SELECTION IS MUCH LARGER THAN PANDORA I LIKE PANDORA AS WELL BUT I SELECTED SOME OF THE SAME ARTISTS I HAVE ON PANDORA AND I HEART HAS PLAYED SONGS I HAVE NEVER HEARD PLAYED ON PANDORA FOR THE SAME ARTIST.
iHeartRadio,awesome app,Mike Fallowfield,20-Jul-16,5,"This app is very fun to have, and you listen to music, and personally I love music and perfect for taking a run, or working out, or cooking and stuff like that so all in all I love this app SO much, and if you like music, I would recommend you getting this app"
iHeartRadio,Great music App!,KyLee,16-Feb-16,5,"I love IHEARTRADIO and having this app on my phone really is amazing for long road trips. Even though you will need to use data outside your wifi to use this app, I will say this is a great app. I love that I can pick my own stations and even build my own stations. Totally think everyone should check out this app. You wont regret it, especially if you are a music lover!"
iHeartRadio,not bad for personal training session,Stela M. Backes,10-Aug-15,4,"I am a personal trainer who also teaches some HITT and interval training classes. This app is great for one on one training session or personal use. Only thing I wish was I could personalize the station more for a class setting, like create a station based on BPM's and advisory labels. Lol don't want a song about sex coming on while I train a class of 40-50 year old women lol"
iHeartRadio,love this app :),Rachael,30-Jul-14,5,"This app has all the genres of music you could possibly think of to listen to: country, classical, jazz, rock, r&b, rap, etc. I wake up every morning and start my day listening to iheart with custom alarm clocks! I have saved DJ radio stations I like as well as customized ones by my favorite bands. There are also occasion stations that you can pick to listen to while you workout, study, drive, and many more. Totally love iheart! Recommend it for everyone that loves music. Check it out and see! You're gonna love it too :)"
iHeartRadio,Checkout NY Radio Stations,Slacker,29-Jun-14,5,"I think because of the time shift, I am able to hear more music at times when I listen, if I listen to radio stations in NY and sometimes Miami.  Plus it is fun to hear ads for local stuff that I have absolutely no context for. ""Come on down to so-and-so's such-and-such and enjoy the best thingamabober this side of the Mississippi"".I really enjoy listing to this while I do yard work or chores. Keeps my mind entertained through the drudgery."
iHeartRadio,Clear Channel thinks for some reason that I wan't to listen to their STUPID artist backgrounds & music factoids,Michael P.,26-Mar-15,1,Clear Channel thinks for some reason that I wan't to listen to their STUPID artist backgrounds & music factoids instead of simply letting the local affiliate run in full. BIG BROTHER at its finest. They control way too much of the Radio Broadcasts in this country - and they simply abuse their power. nuff said!!
iHeartRadio,MUSIC!!!!,Brad,31-Aug-16,4,"Great music, love iHeart but since I am in the country it only work where I have WiFi, if your running off your phones internet you have to have 4G and out here it is not available on my service provider...."
iHeartRadio,"Short timer but so far, really good",HP,23-May-17,4,"Based on how much I've used the app which isn't much, I give it 4 stars.  That is for the songs I hear, how it easy to connect, and the reception other than on radio."
iHeartRadio,The Teenagers of America will Love it  But.,SJ,2-Dec-14,2,"could be better,  I would say it seems the content is a little to controlled , not much for variety.  Seems like your after the teen market here.  Why not call it Teen Heat Radio instead.  You will never attract the older generations beyond 28 years old.  Every station has just about the very same  theme to it,  it gets old very fast.  reminds me of all the 1980's radio stations all in one place."
iHeartRadio,Not Impressed,Dan K. Varns,28-Jun-14,2,"The way this was described it sounded like it would be a great way to listen to music I like. I created my own channel according to directions choosing an artist I liked. Well they play LOTS of that one artist, but not much of anyone else. They don't even offer many artists to even vote up or down. (like or don't llke) Since the artist I initially chose was male, they give me very few female artists to choose from. (only 2 so far) Now my station has about 20 songs that are played over and over. Tired of it after just a couple days."
iHeartRadio,Seems to cause sound issues,T. phillips,25-Nov-12,1,"I've been having a bit of difficulty, my first Fire had intermittent sound issues and Amazon replaced it (love you Amazon!!).  My new fire came in and I noticed sounds in apps that had never been there before, so I figured the first fire was defective.  I downloaded this app again on Thanksgiving morning and immediately started having sound issues again on the fire, not only in this app but in others.  I've deleted the app off the new kindle, reinstalled other apps that started having sound issues and things seems to be back to being fine again on the new fire.  My sister says she occasionally has issues with this app on her phone, so until Amazon gets to the root of my sound issue problem again, I won't be using  the app anymore.As for the app performance itself, eh, it's all right.  I would rather just use vevo or something and hear the song I really wanted to hear, not just hope that it will magically appear."
iHeartRadio,Like it,Naegea,1-May-15,4,"I installed this before through Blackberry World.  I notice now there are stations that are not available.The app should be the same, so what is the problem.  I like it anyway.  I can't find a station in my city butChicago is close by 90 miles."
iHeartRadio,"This camera is is great, works perfect and allows me to keep an ...",Connie N. Eauclaire,25-Aug-16,5,"This camera is is great, works perfect and allows me to keep an eye on home.  I think the only downfall is the very poor directions, I had to go back and read the reviews to find out how to find the camera password and user name"
iHeartRadio,"For Work, For Play and For Falling Alseep",Allison S.,9-Apr-13,5,"This app is perfect for every occasion and situation. I turn it on when I'm working and need some soothing classical music or fun 80s tunes to get me through the day. Then, I'll switch over to one of My Stations after work to hear Disturbed or Pantera.I love the Sleep Timer feature, too, and use that when I travel and have a tough time falling asleep. Falling asleep to music just works!My only gripe ... I really like the Thumbs Up/Down feature for songs. However, I don't think the DJs are actually paying attention because I hear the songs I don't like every single day. There are millions of songs out there... we can hear more than Madonna and Adele every once in a while."

iHeartRadio,BYE SPOTIFY!,Amazon Customer,27-Aug-15,4,"I just signed up for iHeart Radio, and I am dumping Spotify for good. This is so much better, even the sound is of higher quality, and I don't have those awful ads caterwauling at me every ten minutes or so. I can't believe kids listen to that crap--and I can hear my Dad saying the same thing about Led Zeppelin.."

Streaming is the best way to get radio and iHeartRadio has provided access to clear radio reception with a wide variety of listening genres from all over the nation.  The ability to customize my listening is wonderful.  No more listening to something I don't like.  Thank you iHeart."
iHeartRadio,not to cool,Jerry Blankenship,9-Jun-17,1,"not what I like, did not have the station, I wanted out of TX. so, give it back."

iHeartRadio,Awesome app and great music #1 Music app I recommend,Nohemi Godoy,18-Apr-17,5,It is really one of the best music apps and if u haven't tried it yet and your just seeing which music app is better then I really recommend this one and your search for a music app is done because I heart radio is the one you need to download. I will never go back to Pandora or Dezzer or any other music app and I haven't for years because I love I heart radio.
iHeartRadio,The best of it's kind.,Thom Bone,24-Jun-15,5,"I do love Tunein Radio as well especially but that is for everything NON Clear Channel. This app, owned by Clear Channel last I checked, is pretty much only their media and holdings, all on one place. Not bad for what it is.It is my 'go to' for listening into KFI Los Angeles. :)No complaints. The app works fine. I used app ops to turn off some of its permissions and feel like I can listen without being watched."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,John,29-Jul-17,5,I like the all the different kinds of music I can listen to on this

iHeartRadio,awesome,Mom O' 6,17-Jul-16,5,I love this app!! Its so easy and fun! It let's you dance and listen to what YOU want to listen to
iHeartRadio,Innappropriate music on Childrens stations,Victoria George,2-Jan-17,2,"When you select a KIDS RADIO station and they play songs by The Weekend, a song called Pillow Talk, and regularly using songs that are using curse words it makes you rethink what iheart radio deems appropriate for children to listen to. This happens with nick radio, radio Disney, top 40 FAMILY hits as well as a child's radio.Absolutely ridiculous and absurd."
iHeartRadio,requested app,Hilary Deppe,20-Jan-14,5,"I really request this app. It is a good app. If you want, you can just turn on a music station, get a book, and start reading. Or you can go to the &#34;Perfect for&#34; page to see what music is good for at the time. I think a lot of people request this app also. Plus, you can keep the music playing while at the home screen, when you are reading a book on your device, when you turn your device off, or just playing a game. I think this is a perfect app for any age and person. There is also a sleep alarm and a alarm to wake you up. You can also listen while you are getting an app or rating an app. This is a really perfect app."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio Ap,Kindle Customer,26-Jun-14,4,The sound of this Ap is really good.  I was able to get a radio station in my area but when I tried the search feature again for a second radio station in my area I had no luck yet finding one.  I searched with the radio station call numbers and then with the call numbers and the city.  No luck yet.  I would recommend this Ap but I hope that iHartRadio up grades their search to make it easier to find specific radio stations.
iHeartRadio,Disappointed,Rebel 62,17-Jul-15,2,"When I first used the app it worked flawlessly. About a month in (after some update)  the app would cut out for no reason and make no attempt to reconnect to the radio station.  Now the app cuts out  multiple times and I have to re-sign in and tap the play/pause button to reconnect to the station.  I use the TuneIn Radio app whenever this app acts up.  I would use TuneIn for everything but it can not play iHeart stations.  I really like my local iHeart station, but I can't stand how often the station cuts out and the app does not make any effort to reconnect unless you manually stop and start the transmission.... TuneIn will cut out occasionally but it has always retrieves the signals within a minute.  AGAIN THIS app does not seem to care about reconnecting after the signal cuts out."
iHeartRadio,Great App,Laurie,20-Jul-17,5,The iHeartRadio app is great.  The podcasts I listen to come in very clear.

Although, this app DOES NEED WIFI. I hope one day they come out with a new version of iHeartRadio so that it doesn't need WiFi, but for now, you need WiFi for it. I hope you annoy this app."

iHeartRadio,love love love!!!!,Lily Jill,26-Oct-13,5,"This app is perfect!! You can listen to pretty much every station. My favorite station is 93.3 FLZ!! You don't need to have an account.

I got tired of listening ti a song that was my favorite. ""Castles in the Air."" Listeners can create their own radio stations by song or artist, if choose radio stations from stations around the country.  Trouble is, I began to experience problems with the kindle.  Running Internet radio opens up network sockets. I am not a technical wizard, but after running the radio the kindle would get hung up while I was on facebook.  I love listening to music while on the Internet, but nit ag the expense of technical trouble.  Download at your own risk."

It is great if you don't have the systems for or can not afford Streaming radio in your vehicle or on the go. I just pick what I want in any state I choose. For example, the Smooth Jazz station in San Diego, CA has quite a different sound than the one in Philadelphia. I am able to then plug my phone into the charger and the AUX on the other end and listen to great music at my leisure."

I also really enjoy that I can listen to favorite local radio stations, which is something I can't do on Pandora. The one thing that could be better is if I could thumbs-up thumbs-down a song without leaving my current app. But honestly, that's not such a big deal. This app also has pre-made stations such as All Beatles and Stones, or music for working out. I love this app to death, and I would use it all the time!!I would recommend iHeartRadio to anybody who loves music and wants to be able to listen to a variety quickly and easily. iHeart is very easy to use, and the best part?

There's a limit on what you want to listen to, and that's a shame.  I also wish that if you created a playlist such as, ""Beatles"" you only would hear music by that artist  instead of music by that artist AND other artists that are similar.  You don't get the choices or freedom you should, but I do appreciate all of the different kinds of stations, etc."

iHeartRadio,No updates?,Seth Perry,13-Jul-17,1,The app is good but it has not received an update on 2 years. Why the lack of support new features have been added in the new updates that the Amazon version is lacking.

iHeartRadio,Nice musical programing,Sandra D.,17-Jan-17,4,"I found some sites that I like for music but would have like to have been able to find more music from the fifties and sixties.  Also, I like the crooner's  like Bing Crosby and Sinatra.  I did find Paul Simon music,one of my favorites."
iHeartRadio,Love it!  From the islands of lowland rain forests in Panama,Texrealt,18-Jul-15,4,"Love my stations, the artist stations and the intuitive way it helps me ""build"" my stations.  Mostly I like having music almost anywhere I want it.  I live on a remote island in the lowland rain forests of the Republic of Panama.  I would give it five stars, but it limits the number of ""skips"" as you build a station.  After that, you have zero control over the playlist."
iHeartRadio,Love the ability to make stations without commercials,Gab,23-Feb-16,5,"Love the ability to make stations without commercials. My dad likes the variety of  stations because he's a big talk radio fan.Cons: not able to filter your own station for explicit content.Sometimes it mixes up my idea of what the station is supposed to be about (country and techno, really?) .But I guess that's what the thumbs are for.Overall, hurray for streaming without advertisements."
iHeartRadio,Great app,DENISE OCTAVIA AUSTIN,20-Sep-17,5,"Great app!!!Love love love, this app. Can get my favorite stations and songs."
iHeartRadio,Kindle Fire killer App,Larry Renger,19-Feb-14,5,"I received the Kindle as a gift, and as owner of i-Pad, have been trying to figure out where it fits in to my life.  Well, it makes a fantastic hi-fi internet radio system with my new Monster E-NERGY earphones.  You couldn't hear such quality sound when I was really into HI-Fi in college. Not with state of the art receivers, turntables, speakers, amplifiers etc.Higher end earbuds may be better, but my ears no longer are...."
iHeartRadio,Love this free app,Nicole Risch,19-Jan-16,5,"I listen to IheartRadio 4-5 days of the week, especially when getting ready for work in the morning. I can listen to the newest music that is on the radio. Good stations to listen to all over the country and it's free to listen to. It's great to tune into radio stations that you wouldn't even think you could listen to where you live."
iHeartRadio,Great option for those who don't have their own music yet on whichever device.,Amazon Customer,30-Jan-13,5,"I love that you can pick this up on 3G which is what I have.  It is simple to use.  Type in an artist, and voila, you are listening to that artist and more from the similar artists.  I have gotten to love new bands/groups through using this app.  The app shows pics of the group/artist as well, not a video.  More like a slide show so you can put a face with the name.  It has other features as well.  Try it, you an play around with the many options or stick with the basics.  You don't have to be afraid to try a band/group before you buy it as you can listen on iHeartRadio first!  Go for it!"
iHeartRadio,"Ad hog,tends to repeat same add contantly for months",Nicholas Ogden,26-May-15,2,"This program has got way to many adds.  For 3 months they didn't change a fitness add when you started listening to a station.  It was a horrible ad to begin with, then listening to it hundreds of times has lured me away from this program.  I still have it stuck in my head...haw haw hugh planet fitness intimidation.  Makes me so ugh.  My phone seems to drop them a lot to and every time I started it again there's the fitness add again.  FYI there is much better options radio websites have links for there station.  Just bookmark them in your browser.  You can also play playlists from YouTube and even make playlists on your computer you can play anywhere.  I find when you play music from your browser it doesn't drop nearly as much as a app.  Maybe its just my area.  ENJOY!!!"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,SueAnnna68,23-Apr-16,5,Just downloaded iheart radio and I am loving it. Great music and variety of music.
iHeartRadio,Highly Reccomended,Janell Kellett,17-Mar-14,5,"I have this app on my kindle, and it is great when I am slugging through my homework. When it asks to sign in, just press maybe later and you can get live radio, along with timers to shut off, and alarms to ask  you up. When you are signed in, you can get reccomended songs for kids, funny songs, and holiday songs. All of it is free, and there isn't a ton of ads popping up. Plus, if you close out of the app or turn off the screen, the songs will still play while you look stuff up on the internet or whatever. I highly reccomended this app to anyone!"
iHeartRadio,Best Radio,Mrs. &#34;G&#34;,25-Jan-16,5,"This is the best internet radio. So easy to navigate and select music, set up stations etc. Excels above others i have tried. I listen to this on all my devices. Love the fact that I can listen to actual stations in other states and keep up with area news with freinds and relatives!"
iHeartRadio,Good app.,rck419,26-Jun-13,3,"I don't use this app as much as I would like, mostly for working out, or when I don't want to listen to my downloaded music. Sometimes buffers for a few seconds, but overall a good app."
iHeartRadio,just frustrated.,elizabeth johnson,25-Jul-13,2,"When it works it's great but often it skips or it plays 2 things at once, for instance it plays what it's supposed to but overlaying it is something else."
iHeartRadio,Nice to hear full broadcasts somewhere beside my driveway,Elaine,12-Jan-16,5,"Usually only hear the radio in the car and wind up sitting in the driveway listening to the end of something. So it is very nice to hear an entire broadcast from NPR or EIB.  Not the fault of IHeart Radio, but EIB podcasts are inaccessible. Haven't tried NPR podscasts yet but I am looking forrward to hearing my favorite guy, Noir."
iHeartRadio,"Not great, not bad",Josh,3-May-17,4,"""Meh"". Not great, not bad. Plenty of better options."
iHeartRadio,Four Stars,J.Fred,12-Oct-17,4,I had the app before and it is good.
iHeartRadio,Don't drown out the speaker,tusontilly,18-May-15,1,"IF WE COULD LISTEN TO THE SAME TALK SHOW HOSTS ON A DIFFERENT STATION, WE WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE...We listen to iheart radio because we try to accumulate different points of view on major issues facing our nation and the world...we find the background noise of iheart most annoying as it obliterates the words of the person speaking...for example, one minute snippets of Glen Beck or Rush Limbaugh sound like heavy loudness over loudness with muffled voices...bumper music is also too loud, too noisy and too long...iheart radio boasts that it is ""stimulating""...we opine it is aggravating, not enjoyable and very frustrating...REMEMBER, THE PURPOSE OF TALK RADIO IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW, not to drown out the speaker...Our rating would be lower than no stars if that were a choice."
iHeartRadio,A great app,Lorena,24-Dec-16,5,It is a great app. It has loads of songs for you to listen to.
iHeartRadio,One Star,Robert Benz,3-Sep-17,1,Still can't get my Echo to work
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,m,22-May-17,5,Great to get radio from stations across the country
iHeartRadio,Great for traveling or at home,Karissa,28-May-14,4,"When I'm away from home, I like to have access to my favorite radio stations. I also like to check out the stations in the area. This app is great for both. I have discovered new stations that I love that I can now access at any time. One thing I don't like is the difference in stations when using this on the computer as opposed to a tablet. Some of my favorites only come in on one and not the other."
iHeartRadio,Can't listen without creating a profile anymore,Edwin,24-Aug-16,2,"I'm disappointed. I've used iHeart for 3 years or so without needing an account. It was easy to just click ""maybe later"" and start enjoying content without giving any personal info. Today, I no longer see the ""maybe later"" option, and I can't access it without creating a profile. I don't want to create a profile, so I suppose I'll go back to online streaming."
iHeartRadio,"Not bad, not good",James R.,30-Jun-14,3,"Not bad for casual radio, but it's been around for awhile now and hasn't exactly captured my interest as much as Pandora did (earlier) and now Spotify and iTunes Radio, which are the two services I mainly use. Adding iHeartradio as the third doesn't seem like a necessity. By the way, I originally downloaded this app as part of an Amazon promotion for free amazon coins."
iHeartRadio,"Best way to hear radio from all over this wonderful country, plus make your own show with your preferences!",donna lacy,16-Jun-15,5,"Great way to get radio from all over the country! I knew my cousin's son was a DJ, but didn't know him that well. But through this I'm able to hear a morning radio show he produces in Raleigh, N.C.!!  We aren't allowed to promote, but if you enjoy conservative talk radio check this out. Also good for making your very own radio show, with the type of music and artists you love. I enjoy it very much."
iHeartRadio,Get this app.,D. Kathleen,18-Oct-16,5,I enjoy clear sounding radio broadcasts from stations I would normally miss out on. Not just locally but across the country.
iHeartRadio,IHeart Radio Too Hard to Use,Mag,28-Feb-14,1,"It's a good concept, but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites.  Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the?  I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east?  I was hitting the choices to see what would happen.  Once I got a station on favorites (always by mistake), it was futile to remove it from the list.  Know what?  I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?!  Just more headaches.  The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who don't sit hitting buttons all day long.  Lastly, there didn't appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music.  I'm  not a  Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days.  We Boomers aren't dead yet, people!  Provide something for our age group or lose business.  Thank you."
iHeartRadio,Really good find!,Max Spiker,26-Dec-16,5,Really like this app. easy to find favorite music._Ÿ_¶heard lots about it. much better than I expected. Highly recommend it.

iHeartRadio,For every mood and music lover,P M Jones,29-Mar-16,4,Great selection of stations with many varying music genres. I find iHeart to be easy to navigate and love listening to the various stations in my car as well at home. Station selection is better than auto radio.
iHeartRadio,... this for one show a week and it works great!,Try_to_fixit,23-Jul-17,5,I use this for one show a week and it works great!
iHeartRadio,Perfect for news junkies,CRG,2-Feb-16,5,"Excellent app, especially if you're a news and talk radio junkie. Broadcasts from all over the US. Streaming is pretty smooth; disconnects and rebuffering happen every now and then, but it's rarely bothersome. The free version works fine and you are not required to create an account."
iHeartRadio,Great for all times,2004,10-Jul-17,5,I like to use this app when I'm gaming or cleaning.It was lots of good stations and has pretty much every song artist your looking for_Ÿ_µ_Ÿ_§

iHeartRadio,It's iheart,Candace Parker,9-Mar-16,5,So far I have had no problems with this app. It gives off the same sound quality as prime music. The only thing I don't like about it is that it does not have the custom channel that the apple version gives you.

Tulgren,15-Apr-12,5,this is a great app. it has a ton of radio stations from all over the country. you can also make a playlist that has music from your favorite artist and artists who are similar. the only thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can only skip so many songs and you cant have a set song playlist....

iHeartRadio,Bad Support,doglover2222,14-Feb-13,1,"I just bought a new car that has links to all kinds of apps. I had to register with all of these apps and by the time I got to I-heart, I forgot to store my password. I went through the process of a new temp password on my I phone and an hour later through my pc. I did not only not get the 2 minute response on either request and I contacted them through e-mail and still do not have a response that is now six hours later. I have heard good things about this product but I may never know until I get a response.Yes, my mistake originally, but the site and support has totally failed."

It gives me ""instructions"" that don't work.  I upgraded on the IHeart app but it won't let me cancel on the IHeart app and it's not right.  Guess I'm going to have to put a stop payment on the charge.  Otherwise I like the app and listen to it everyday, but it's not user friendly and they obviously don't like you canceling subscriptions."

iHeartRadio,A must for music fans,Goldberg Family,16-Apr-14,5,"I've been using iHeartRadio on a variety of devices for months, and it's excellent. The ability to create stations from your favorite artists and listen to radio stations from around the nation is great, and it means that you're never stuck listening to just a handful of local stations all the time. Add in a huge catalog and flawless streaming even on slow connections and you've got a winning app right here."

iHeartRadio,Best radio app!,mintpatti,30-Jun-13,5,"This app is AMAZING! I live in Arizona and I am able to listen to different music stations from other States and live ones from my state just from my kindle fire! There are few advertisements. And they only show when you have been off the app for awhile or sometimes switching stations. That's the only time you see them and they range from 5 sec to 30 sec. It shows you the song, artist, and album cover when they play a song. Also, you can create a custom stations and set a timer for how long you want the radio on. The recent thing added is radio alarm. I am in love with this app and would highly recommend it to anyone."

I just feel that if you select a station for a certain type/style of music you should be able to listen to that genre specifically."

Not that it's bad but sometimes I want to listen to MY kind of music.  Pandora was working for me for a while but then I was missing all the talk shows I like to listen to on the radio.  Then I found this app and now I can listen to the Steve Harvey Morning Show.  I can list to ANY radio station of my choosing.  It can't get any better than this.  I love this app!!!

iHeartRadio,Facebook isnt needed.,fg,9-Feb-13,5,"It does not state that a facebook account is NEEDED to use this. Oh, you seen the Facebook icon when you start up? Hit the maybe later button! Before you freak out and throw a hundred 1-* reviews at it, for some of you, stop putting reviews on what you read on the review page. It only states that do you want to use facebook, to like songs and stations, and create so called stations of your own. Facebook isnt needed here, and it shouldnt be needed anywhere, as well as wanted anywhere."

iHeartRadio,Annoying to Use,Clyde A. Boyd,28-Jul-15,1,"The I heart radio app is so annoyingly commercialized I really dislike using it. First of all when you turn it on you get a 30 second ad which you cannot skip. Secondly, your last station may or may not be on the app without searching for minutes at a time. And finally when you go to rate the app at the Apple store guess what happens? If you give it a low rating the review mysteriously gets immediately rejected! Hows that for keeping all reviews positive! This type of dishonesty and unethical conduct is pretty much what clear channel used to be accused of. All in all its an ok app for listening to music but it is annoying to use and they dont want you to tell anyone about its defects."
iHeartRadio,not for me,bill,30-May-17,2,dont like it much
iHeartRadio,Great Music made easy!!,Jonathan Sorensen,22-Jul-17,5,Great way to find new music. High quality app that lets you hear music you love!
iHeartRadio,"The station has good music, but it's not as easy to find ...",Stephanie Bradley,29-Mar-16,4,"The station has good music, but it's not as easy to find your Artist you may like.  Also each Artist I did download it had the same Artist to listen to. Example: I down load Gerald Levart, it played other artist like Dru hill, Charlie wilson, Levant and when I download Levant they played the same artist."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Stefanie,5-Jun-17,5,I wish they had more conservative stations though.
iHeartRadio,My new iHeart Radio station,Kendra Posey,2-Sep-17,5,I find using iHeart Radio a great place to find all kinds of music. I use it with my Kindle through Alexa.

iHeartRadio,i heart radio app,BevFredette,22-Sep-13,5,"I like this new app for i heart radio. I have pandora app also but I like this one so much better. More variety of music. Easy to use.

iHeartRadio,Account required to create your own radio station,HilDan,1-Jan-14,2,"There were only 4, yes, four, stations available when scanning. None of interest to me. The music suggested for various occupations did not suit me either. To find music I like, it was necessary to  create a station with my choice of music. This is possible only by using either a Facebook or email account. Don't want an account even though it's free. Goodbye I Heart radio. You're not for me."
iHeartRadio,Works great!,ck40711,25-Aug-17,5,"I use this app to let me kids listen to the radio on their devices.  Works great on the Kindle Fire, would definitely download again."

iHeartRadio,Great App,Larry Barton,13-Feb-13,5,"I have several devises that play my music, and I enjoy them all.  However, IHeartRadio is the handiest of them all.  I don't have to do the artist, album, genre, etc. choice thing.  I simply put in an artist of the type I'd like to listen to and sit back and enjoy.  I get a variety of music all similar to the artist I picked.  I also love the comedy channels that are available.  I put them on at night with the ""sleep"" function and smile myself to sleep."

iHeartRadio,best app ever,M&amp;D lover,22-Jun-14,5,This is the best app ever! It has great music for people of all ages my mom has the app as well and we both love it!!! It gives us a Chance to listen to whatever we want which is great because my mom and I have different tastes in music. Thank you for creating this app and if you don't have it I recommend this to you no matter how old you are. Trust me your life will change in a great way once you have iheartradio and if your wondering if it will work on your device I have it on my kindle fire and my mom has it on her kindle fire and smartphone! LOVE this app!!!
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Mark W.,24-May-17,5,Great App
iHeartRadio,No App was in CLOUD,Redrage502,2-May-13,1,"I got the ""I (heart) RADIO"" app for my Kindle Fire. It's a good thing it's a free app because it never showed up for me to download. I followed directions. I went to APPS, clicked on CLOUD as instructed. The 'radio' app was not there, and no direction to go elsewhere to connect.I have, and love, the app on my Samsung phone and tablet. It was easy to download, on both devices.The entire Kindle process was complicated, and I didn't get what I wanted.I couldn't post this if I didn't do 'a star' rating. So I could not choose '0' stars."
iHeartRadio,BEST MUSIC APP EVER!!!!!,Rondell Carson,1-Mar-15,5,This app is the best music app ever!!!!! For someone like me who has a very diverse music taste and loves tons of different genres this is great because it plays my favorite songs and introduces me to new bands that I fall in love with. When you like or dislike a song the app really gets to know what music you like so it won't play anything you don't like. If you love music then download this app IMMEDIATELY!!!!! You will never regret it.
iHeartRadio,K-LOVE,Michael Joseph Franciosa,21-Jun-16,5,"Always love listening to up lifting music, thank you very much for the station."
iHeartRadio,Iheart Advertising Scheme,Ken Meade,18-May-15,1,"I installed Iheart on my droid some time ago. Recently, I have been having trouble with the app halting. I have to hit the pause button then hit the play button about once every ten minutes or so. I've contacted Iheart about this and was given several ideas of how to make the problem go away, but none have worked. Now, I'm inclined to think this may be an advertizing scheme of Iheart. Each time I have to restart the program, I have to listen to a commercial then the program I was listening to resumes. Does Iheart have a counter going on that ticks off one more tune in by a customer for the company they are advertising for?I'm inclined to think Iheart won't let this comment be posted."
iHeartRadio,"Can use it on Echo Dot, but am having ...",Amazon Customer,25-Jul-17,3,"Can use it on Echo Dot, but am having lots of difficulties getting individual artists & songs.  Wants me to buy something else.  iHeart Music is not condusive to specific requests, just stations relating to the artist.  Maybe not setting up properly."
iHeartRadio,NONE BETTER,Amazon Customer,25-Mar-17,5,"Simply put, the best app for every taste. Love it!"
iHeartRadio,awesome music by favorite artists,Laura Strnad,17-Jun-17,5,I listen mostly to K-love on it. I am loving it because of the artists I can listen to.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Brigido Ornelas,24-Jun-17,5,great
iHeartRadio,complements TuneIn Radio,Al A,20-May-13,4,"similar to TuneIn radio, but it's handy to keep both if (as in my case) the stations I want to listen aren't all carried on one or the other. Using only TuneIn I could listen to the programs I wanted live but from another city, but iHeart has some local stations TuneIn doesn't (and vice versa). If you're stuck with commercials, they might as well be for something that applicable to you (same for news & weather). Of the two I do prefer TuneIn, but additional choices is always a good thing"
iHeartRadio,No regrets,klabaty,17-Jul-16,5,I cancelled my Pandora subscription due to their political stance. Wished I had been using iHeartRadio all along. I am certainly getting more from this free app than I ever got from Pandora.
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio,djm53,20-Aug-17,5,"great programing, easy to use"
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Jaronamo Cone,26-May-17,5,Good
iHeartRadio,Your favorite station wherever you are,david middlebrough,19-Jun-16,5,"I love this app, I can listen to he music I like wherever I am. Doesn't matter if you are in the area of your favorite radio station or not. Just mark you favorite station and you can listen to it wherever you are."
iHeartRadio,awesome when it's not crashing!,Amber,8-Mar-16,4,"Nice mixture of music and very low on adds especially compared to a couple others out there. Some of the stations can get a tad bit repetitive, but there's enough to choose from that I am usually content. The only issue I have is it crashes every once in a while and I end up having to restart the kindle. For the most part I can deal with that, just when it does it multiple times a day. Tedious waiting on all that when trying to just jam for a moment."
iHeartRadio,Great,Samantha Ortiz,26-Mar-13,4,Once u made your account u can hear the radio and people that said u needed facebook  u people are wrong! U don't need  facebook for doing it so just try!
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio is Great!,B. F.,22-Jan-17,5,Love all the new stations I can listen to.
iHeartRadio,Does what you'd expect it to do,Michael Haywood,22-May-14,4,"Of course you have to have an account first but after signing in or up and getting use to it, iHeartRadio can actually be quite useful. You can create your own channels, Pick favorites, and things of that nature. Pretty much doing what you expect of a Radio related app. It's certainly not bad at all and worth checking out."
iHeartRadio,It is a great app,Ruth,25-Mar-14,4,I enjoy having this application however find that I do not use this as much as I possible could.  I find it a little hard or rather confusing t o figure out how to program what I want just my age I am sure as my grandchildren have no problems at all.  They are teaching my though so it is all good this Grandmother has to get up with the times is what I am told. (LOL)!
iHeartRadio,More free entertainment on your phone,kevindsingleton,15-Jun-12,5,"I acquired iHeart Radio in order to be able to access radio stations from my hometown, and to keep up with my Dallas Cowboys, who don't get much coverage here, in the Pittsburgh area (go figure!).  It's simple to set up, and easy to use, and you can get most ClearChannel stations piped directly to your phone.  It's as reliable as your cell coverage, but the iHeart app does freeze up, now and then, and appears to be searching for a signal, even when the phone indicates full signal strength.  It's probably a little better on wi-fi, or 4G."
iHeartRadio,Keep Rockin!,Hippie Juice Man,8-Jun-17,5,"I'm think iHeart Radio has made the top three(3), streaming radio apps.Peace out, for now!  ""Live Long & Tape On!"""

iHeartRadio,Spontaneous shutdowns...,Salli4th,23-Apr-15,1,The app did not work past the initial page and spontaneously shut down every time. Was not able to create an account or move around in the app at all. Your mileage may vary. I found that the TuneIn app works. Using a Kindle Fire.
iHeartRadio,Great variety radio app!!,Senior citizen,26-Feb-15,4,Great way to listen to my favorite programs. I like to listen to other news from around the world and here in the U.S.. It gives you different views to the news . Instead of the managed news that we normally get. My wife and I have the same app on our GRACE INTERNET RADIOS and enjoy the variety of music and news on them also.I have had the app on the K FIRE HD FOR about a week and the RADIOS for about a year.
iHeartRadio,Mostly Christian Music,JOHN PARRISH,27-Feb-16,4,"I give this station a 4-star for easy listening but get turned off when it plays Christian music that sounds like rock.  My granddaughter, age 12, thinks this is the only station on the radio and I downloaded it for her listening pleasure because it helps keep her away from the really hard rock junk."

iHeartRadio,DO NOT PAY TO UPGRADE,Amazon Customer,24-Mar-17,3,"Would get 5 for paid version, except barely any songs would play offline, which is basically what you are paying for! If I want to stram, Pandora is a way better app for that! Very disappointed indeed. DONT PAY FOR THIS APP"
iHeartRadio,STOP SIGNING ME OUT !!!,cancer13,13-Jun-14,3,"THE GOOD: pretty good content, not like an actual FM radio bc only play the ones who belong to the Clear Channel Corp. But it can replace pandora/spotify .THE BAD: it asks to create a log in, (I don't wanna sync my fb), but it logs u out EVERY 6days or so. It gets ANNOYING, if you don't sign in it doesn't let you access your customized stations.THE UGLY:DON'T RELY ON the ALARM feature !!! It always crashes and the ALARM doesn't go on. A rooster is more reliable ."

I listen to several station from time to time,but I heart is clear Crystal listening music of my choice. You can create your own style of music.

iHeartRadio,MUST HAVE APP,Scooby,14-Jan-14,5,"I always thought that iheart was just a bunch of radio stations. Then I tried it. I can make my own stations, choosing the artists who I want to hear. I have stations for every genre. This is a great app. Pick an artist and iheart will play similar artists, making a great station. Then there are the live stations from all over the country. Stations for every genre of music. Many thanks to I heart radio for hours of entertainment."

iHeartRadio,Four star,Maiden,16-Apr-17,4,"Decent app, I wish I had a bit more control over content of individual channels, more skips would be good.I do like their variety of even obscure artists!"
iHeartRadio,Al's Review,Al,14-Jan-14,2,"I like to be able to listen to radio on my Kindle.  I really don't like the difficulty of turning it on and off.  When I stop the radio playing and close the kindle, it starts to play again continuously.  Each time I go into the app, it is difficult to find the station I want to listen to.  And when I do find it, and tap it, often I miss slightly and another one comes on.  When this happens, I am unable to delete that station."
iHeartRadio,Good app,Nicole,29-Jul-12,5,This is a great app for the music and works well on the Kindle Fire. As a new owner I see some apps work well on it and some do not. So far this is a keeper.

iHeartRadio,Annoying Commercials and PSAs.,Flying Marine Phantom II,12-Jan-14,1,"I've used this App to listen to KFYI in Phoenix late at night / early in the AM. Lately twenty minutes of each hour is take up with idiotic PSAs about hunger, social change, the proper car seat for kids and the like, along with some annoying woman who can't pronounce the word WOLF expostulating for three minutes about the Grammy and Golden Globe nominees.I'm done with it."

iHeartRadio,Recommended!,Olivia Akers,17-Aug-15,5,"I have a radio, but I only use it for the auxiliary because the live radio stations don't work. This app has saved my life! It's similar to Pandora, but better! I can finally listen to any radio station I want, live, and free of charge! I highly recommend it! I can finally just plug in my headphones and just jam out to my favorite tunes, whether I own them on Amazon or not!"

iHeartRadio,impressed,klesey Brown,6-Sep-14,5,"So this app is actually very good, I really enjoy it. I always had trouble with my Pandora account. Nothing is more annoying than trying to listen to your favorite music and the station starts glitching! So I was having a lot of trouble with my Pandora account as usual and I was so over it and I asked all of my Facebook friends what is a good app for listening to good music and they suggested iheat radio. I downloaded it and now I'm so impressed with the results! This is a good app to have unless you don't have WiFi. You have to download it! I use mine every day."
iHeartRadio,Love It!,Dawn M Bergerson,20-Aug-16,5,I just love IHeartRadio have had it on my phone for over a year love how easy-to-use it is and all the great music and stations. Also the fact I can create my own stations to suit my mood.

iHeartRadio,Wish it dont need WIFI,Amazon Customer,26-Jun-17,4,I really really like this app and I love all the stations. I really think you should download this app cuz its the best.

iHeartRadio,I like listening to my music when I want to where ...,V,31-May-15,5,I like listening to my music when I want to where ever I want to and I heart lets me do just that.

Don't leave home without it
iHeartRadio,An Awesome Radio app!,Imani G,12-Aug-14,5,"An Awesome Radio app!  I love the freedom to select music from many different genre's.  Also, the ability to make your own stations is so cool.

So my daughter downloaded I heart radio to my iPhone and my kindle. I couldn't 't fall asleep one night during my hospital stay so I turned on I heart radio. It was amazing!!!! I listened to all my favorite radio stations and songs and it helped me fall asleep. I would recommend it to every one."
iHeartRadio,4.5 maybe 4.8642305,ebillcoyne,23-Jul-15,4,"In some small ways, not as versatile as Pandora.  For example, Pandora allows grouping of artists in one station.  Also, site info on artists is pretty handy. However, iHeart provides actual radio stations.  I wish Pandora offered the same. Excellent sound quality over WiFi on a cheap ICraig Android dongle."

iHeartRadio,I LOVE this app,woodhead 1023,28-Jun-17,5,I LOVE THIS APP.  Nothing better.  Just like a radio that know what you like and what you DO NOT LIKE.  Just keep clicking if you like the song or you don't like the song and soon you will see things will change for the better.  You will see.
iHeartRadio,Great!!!,Kathryn W. Buck Cannella,15-Apr-17,5,I just got this app and I'm loving it. I'm having trouble finding something for them to improve. I'm surprised more people don't have it.

Afterall, when you're born in TN, raised in SO  MD, you just have to love country.  HOWEVER, grew up with Elvis, the Beetles and all those bands...it's all there oniHeartRadio. I love it and recommend downloading it today...you can still do anything else you want and listen too."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio is by far the best to me,Kip T.,20-Feb-15,5,"Out of the 3 music sources that I have, iHeartRadio is by far the best to me. New music basically all the time, good selection of stations and enough to give you choices. If you listen to Pandora long enough, you will have the same songs over and over. You won't have that withiHeart. Plus it's free !!!!"
iHeartRadio,LOVE IT,jennifer york,3-Jun-15,5,"I just got this app, and let me tell you, it was a great decision! This app has a very wide variety of songs, artists, and genres to choose from.

iHeartRadio,Don't like the fact that if headset is plugged in that ...,Tara,29-Jul-14,4,"Don't like the fact that if headset is plugged in that the alarm doesn't sound out loud like through the phone or the kindle liek a reg alarm it instead is heard through the headphones. Be careful if you're relying on the alarm, they should change it like pandora does their alarm where it sounds through the headphones and through the device. Other than that I <3 carrying around my radio station where ever I go."

If I am diving listening to the radio and something comes on I don't like or want to hear I can change as I wish... just wish I could do this on this app as well. At least slacker radio will make u listen to 1 song to get another skip back so I gave them 5 stars.
iHeartRadio,Horrid since last update don't work at all,Ann Fries,15-Jul-16,1,Since the last update I get error that my Internet is not good ebough and wont let me do anything. It will stay open at the top but i cant change the stations. So disappointed as I have used this app for a long time. Please fix as my husband used to love using the app at work but may just have to stop using now. Please fix soon.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,darlene ulrich,19-Apr-17,5,GREAT
iHeartRadio,This app is great on my phone,leanne lloyd,14-Jul-17,2,"This app is great on my phone, but I don't seem to be able to save songs to my playlists, or play my playlists. I pay 9.99 for all access, but don't have it on all my devices?  Kind of vexing."
iHeartRadio,Great app,ken d,17-May-17,5,"Love it,I can all the the stations I want,and my own station list.if you  like all types of notes ,this the app to get."
iHeartRadio,Free music is awesome,C long,31-Oct-15,5,"Wonderful way to get radio stations. Originally downloaded so I could hear the Republican debates as I don't have cable. Since then, I have customized my stations and have found a lot of music as well as news radio to enjoy. It's a good addition to my Amazon Prime music."
iHeartRadio,Great music!,Karen Pisacane,18-Jul-17,5,Lots of different music. Can find anything you are looking for.
iHeartRadio,Wake up mornings,Chere,1-Jul-17,5,I use I heart.com  everyday.  It's my personal alarm clock!  Hallelujah cm.  With Jesus in the morning daily!
iHeartRadio,"It's so good, I feel guilty neglecting Pandora Radio.",Genevak88,13-Jan-14,5,"This is a really wonderful radio, I didn't expect it to be so good. This is commonly from a long-time Pandora Radio User. It has less interruptions as Pandora, and works more efficiently. (as an app) I don't have to upgrade to a different plan to get certain plans. It's seriously a really good app, I feel like I'm neglecting Pandora after the history we've had together. I sometimes get too guilty that I check in with Pandora just to see if it's ok (I'm normal, I swear!!) But anyways this is a wonderful app it's really miraculous. You will defiantly enjoy it!! *Thumbs Up*"
iHeartRadio,"Last played station is listed dead last in ""MY STATIONS"" when the app is closed then reopened later.",Mike,20-Aug-16,1,"Amazon fire version of the app places the last played station at the end of the line, on the ""My Stations"" list. The last station played should show as the first one on the list when I open this app on Fire TV. The version on my cell phone puts the last played station at the top/front of the list, which is preferable because it means I spend less time scrolling and more time listening to music (and your commercials, which is how you make money)."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Brenda Peterson,17-Feb-17,5,Great
iHeartRadio,Inspiring!,M F,26-Mar-17,5,Awesome variety. Love it!
iHeartRadio,GET THIS APP!!!!!,by cool,5-Apr-14,5,This is the best radio app I have ever got. Pandora and those other radio apps you usally have to pay a fee for certain songs or stations. But iheart radio u get every station for free! You just need to sign up with Facebook or email and you can get any station. I also recomend this app for any age kid this is coming from a twenty-five year old man. Get this app and you will be happy. :):):):):):):)P.s. I recommend country (I love it the best)!!!!
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio,Stockholm mom,6-Jun-13,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP! THANKS TO THIS APP, I'VE DISCOVERED GREAT NEW ARTISTS LIKE CARRIE UNDERWOOD! I LOVE THE FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE A KIND OF ACTIVITY, AND IT COMES UP WITH A STATION FOR THAT ACTIVITY! ALSO, IT HAS SOUNDS OF BIRD AND WAVES AND THINGS! THIS IS THE SAME AS PANDORA, JUST WAAAAAY BETTER! THERE'S ALSO A WEBSITE (iHeart.com). THIS APP IS TOO GOOD TO BE FREE! YOU SHOULD REALLY GET IT!!!!!"
iHeartRadio,Can't get Iheart radio to work on my tablet.,Jamie Thoresz,26-Nov-13,2,"I couldn't get it to work on my tablet. Never having used anything similar, I didn't know what to expect but thought it would be an easier process. (just click and listen). I basically wanted to listen to internet radio and it wouldn't come thru. It supposedly downloaded, but it kept asking me to download it each time. I finally gave up. Don't know if it would work with music,but probably not.My amazon shop.com almost never comes up on my tablet the way it should. I have to keep going back to the settings menu, clear data and retry and then it's still ""iffy"".I will try it again at some point."
iHeartRadio,I love it,LittleDeer,15-Dec-15,5,With this app you can customize the station like Pandora but also have live radio to listen to like the news or weather. So it just has that little bit more.
iHeartRadio,"Nice app, but parents beware!",LissaLeeAnn,5-Jan-15,4,"This was downloaded to my pre-teen daughter's Kindle Fire and she really enjoys listening to certain stations.  However, as a parent be very cautious as to which stations your child is allowed to listen as there are NO filters and lots of inappropriate material on it.  I recommend your child not be left unattended while listening."
iHeartRadio,This app is great!,gaby,28-Nov-16,5,I have trouble trying to find songs to listen to that I like... But this app does it for you!! This is an amazing app!!_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜_
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio Free Music & Internet Radio app,Ronda Pennycuff,4-Feb-16,5,What I really like about iHeartRadio is that you can listen to any of your favorite artists and songs anytime you want. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes to listen to music on the go. I am really glad I have this app on my tablet.
iHeartRadio,I heart radio,daffy,27-Oct-17,5,I love this wish I had found it sooner I can listen to my oldies ny time now just love this
iHeartRadio,LOVE THIS APP,buttoxens are stupid,11-Apr-15,5,I love iheartradio! this app is great cuz i have a bunch of siblings and they annoy the crap out of me sometimes and music is my getaway place. but iheart radio has so many ads on it i will go to look at the lyrics of a song and it will pop up with at least 6 different ads before the next song is even over. but overall this app is great And bonus that it's free even so that was a huge bonus love the app way better than pandora. pandora SUCKS DUCK and yes i meant to put ducks
iHeartRadio,90 minute repeats - just like their radio stations,Eric Enn,3-Apr-14,3,"I was hoping for more when I finally signed up for a 'IHeartRadio' account, but after 6 hours of listening today (while repairing some equipment) I figured out that they repeat songs every 90 minutes just like all their radio stations. When you start hearing repeats you need to go reset your starting point.Considering the amount of music available to an 'online only' music service, it astounds me that they have to repeat somgs after only 90 minutes. (I thought that about broadcast radio too but got over that pretty quickly.)So I will use them occasionally but it is not the 'one place' to hear music."
iHeartRadio,Good app,Ironman,19-Jul-17,5,Good app cheak out my yt channel masonkish and subscribe please and this is a app to get very good app
iHeartRadio,where is app for Kindle Fire?,Kathy,16-Feb-16,1,I don'at understand. why can't I use this app on Kindle?you're having a kindle fire contest with I Heart Radio and youdon't have an appy for Kindle.. please make an app foreveryone to use
iHeartRadio,IHeartRadio,Kitten,25-May-16,5,I purchased this so that I could get this program on my tablet and phone.  The down load went quick and I was able to view both on the table and phone that I have.  I would recommend this product.
iHeartRadio,Amazing,crystle durham,4-Mar-17,5,Get this app it is amazing
iHeartRadio,Great app,Tanika L Carroll,6-May-13,5,"Iheartradio is a really cool app, I use it a lot, especially the radio stations. I love the fact that I can listen to all the different radio stations in the country, especially the ones on Long Island. I grew up on LI, so to be able to listen to those radio stations again, brings back a lot of memories. But aside from that, being able to listen to all my favorite artists and create stations based off of them is the best part."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,James,8-Feb-17,5,cool
iHeartRadio,Good app!,Becky,27-Mar-14,5,This is the first music/radio app I have ever downloaded and it's simple to use. Every once in a while there is a pause but it more than likely could be a wireless connection.  It's never paused for more than a minute or so and it's not often enough for me to give it less than 5 stars.  There are so many music apps out there but I'm satisfied with this one until there's reason not to be.
iHeartRadio,Freedom from adds but poor selection process,mbhnm,3-Aug-15,3,"Love the freedom from adds, despise the ""rate song"" function. I am not interested in listening to someone else's choices on the existing stations so I created my own. The most aggravating feature is the ""rate song"" function. Despite having told the app that I don't like or want songs from a particular artist, that artist still regularly appears. The ""rate song"" function also does not seem to recognize the genre of songs I select that I want to hear. Also, I have not found a way to suggest artists for the venue. Has a long way to go before it replaces Pandora."
iHeartRadio,great app,havokcougar,29-May-17,5,Listen to great music anywhere
iHeartRadio,Love this app.,PreachNurse,22-Feb-14,5,"I love this app. Unlike other music apps I've tried, this one doesn't stop. It doesn't interrupt the music with a screen asking if I'm still in the room. That is so annoying. I also love the variety of music chosen for ""my"" stations."
iHeartRadio,Would not play desired station and no response for help from the developer.  Waste of download time.,SZ,5-Dec-13,1,"I was really excited about this app and I wanted to love it, but my experience just isn't good.  I downloaded the app because it was supposed to broadcast one specific station that I really wanted.  The station advertised that it is available on this app and the app itself also advertised the station.  However, after downloading, I clicked on the station to play it and my phone just sat silent.  I tried playing other stations, all of which seemed to work fine.  But the one station that I wanted, and the only reason I downloaded the app, did not work.  My husband had the app on his phone (which is a completely different model and OS) and the result was the same.  The app just would not play the desired station.  I would have written the experience off with a few more stars because other stations did work.  However, I contacted iHeartRadio via their reporting service and described my issue.  I never heard back from them.  As a result, I give three stars for the app not working as advertised and I lowered that to just one star because of the lack of response by the developer."
iHeartRadio,Not bad but some fails,alex,7-Jan-17,3,I like the app but you can't pick your own songs. Also every song that are on the artists stations aren't clean. Some parents hate that.
iHeartRadio,This app is great for listening to the radio,Jen,26-Apr-16,5,"This app is great for listening to the radio. Instead of downloading each stations app, you can save space on your device with getting them all in this one little app.It works great. I have no trouble with it."
iHeartRadio,The Best,jalin_tippit_Ÿ’™_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜_âœŒ_Ÿ’„_Ÿ’__Ÿ_µ;-),26-Jun-16,5,"All my favorite song songs and if you create a station as a song, it plays it like 5 times a day.# Beast"

iHeartRadio,Amazing musis,Robin Lowman,25-May-17,5,I love I heart you just pick what you want to listen to and they do the rest you just sit back an enjoy.
iHeartRadio,Awesome app!,Kathy L Tyler,30-Mar-13,5,"I love iHeartRadio! I listen to it on my Android phone while I walk with my dogs. Plays great music, and some songs that bring me back to my 20's and 30's."
iHeartRadio,iheart this app!,AnteaterSmoke,7-Jun-14,5,For anyone that misses the local stations that were available in their childhood but because of distance they can no longer tune in this is the perfect solution. I listen to local sports shows about my undergraduate university via this app and am so thankful to be able to follow those shows again!
iHeartRadio,favorite music app,Jfgthe3rd,26-Jun-15,5,It's as if they have climbed into my head and found all the great music that I didn't know I loved.  When you create a station and take the time to rate the songs (thumbs up/thumbs down) they play for you for a little while you will be rewarded with songs you feel as if you already know and love. The intuition of the algorithms is uncanny and wonderful. I am never disappointed.
iHeartRadio,Music>You,Shanice B.,16-Mar-17,5,I love this app because it plays mostly all the songs I love when I choose a station only sometimes it will go to a song that has nothing to do with the specific artist or band you choose. It is still 5 stars and you should download it!
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,19-Apr-17,5,_Ÿ‘ç

iHeartRadio,Great app identify the titles for 5 stars !,Mitch Kirsner,1-Jan-17,4,"Great app to work with the Echo dot, the ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is because unlike with my spotify playlist it will not identify which song I am listening to when I ask."

iHeartRadio,"Hello *clean* music, goodbye dirtyp music",Michelle H.,10-Jun-14,5,"Remember not everything is clean on here but if you choose a perfect for thingy it should be clean . Choose stations wisely on ur radioes.

I highly sugest that you use this app on the go and where your internet service is reliable. I have used this app for years..."
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio on kindle fire,Psycho Chick,27-Sep-13,5,Love it love it love it. The app works great. Haven't had a single problem in all this time that I have been using it (over a year). There is a few radio stations I'm waiting for them to get and I believe there is only one artist that isn't on there yet that I like. I know they will be at some point though cause it would be stupid for them to not get on here with how popular this app is. AND it's free. How much better could it get? None!
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,12-Apr-17,5,Good music app
iHeartRadio,must have,Stang,2-Jan-15,5,They have absolutely every category you would want plus you do NOT have to use a Facebook account instead you sign up with email if necessary (I did and it is working perfectly).  They play all the right songs and have variety if you love music and want the right app this is it lot's of people have trouble with other apps like Pandora I personally think that this app is better.  I definitely recommend this app for everyone!!!!!
iHeartRadio,Sucks,Rrrush,26-Apr-17,1,I use pandora so....i dont like this app
iHeartRadio,Appealing Presentation,Simon Jester,30-Aug-17,4,I found the various options easy to use and the presentation appealing. I'd recommend the app to a friend.

iHeartRadio,Updates have not improved the app,s beyl,3-Nov-17,1,Used to be an easy to use app. Now very complicated and not user friendly. Keep trying to charge money to listen to what is free on the radio. Frequently drops out. They have ruined this app.
iHeartRadio,Must have,Our D.,28-Aug-15,5,I love this app.  I having been waiting for something like this for years.  Especially Sunny radio.  It bring back so many memories and great timeless music.
iHeartRadio,Wonderful wonderful wonderful,Obi Wan,15-Apr-15,5,"This is a fantastic app, even for just the basic free service.I have it installed on multiple devices but the one I use it most on is my last generation smartphone that I keep hooked up to my stereo at home. I will put IHeartRadio on and pick whatever type of music I'm in the mood for and let it do it's thing over my home stereo system. If I feel like hearing a particular song I can pick that song, then it'll play songs that fit very well with the one I picked for hours.You get some repeat songs day to day, but not hour to hour.The UI is fantastic and intuitive."
iHeartRadio,Good app,Lee A. Scott-Smith,26-May-17,4,I don't know how to use all of the features but I listen to it a lot.
iHeartRadio,Favorites All The Time,Bren,21-Sep-13,5,I love this app so much. I especially love that you can choose your own stations and create your list of favorites.

iHeartRadio,Keeps my day fun!,Deanne Horton,22-May-16,4,"I do wish there was an easier way to make a personalized play list.  There are a lot of older songs that never get played.  On the other hand, I have discovered a lot of new bands adn songs that make my day fly by and keep me smiling."
iHeartRadio,awesomeness!!!!,edgerton,8-Oct-13,5,"I love this app. it is awesome. I love the fact that thee are no adds deception for every 10-12 songs but they are the type of adds that are just a picture.  another great thing is that I don't remember seeing an inappropriate add ever.  I think that if you want free music and/or a custom station along with the option of regular stations, this is the app for you.  also, the fact that this is a free app is even better.  although you have to create an account.  this never bothers me because the scouts are FREE.  if you want free music, custom stations, and regular stations, this is the app for you."

iHeartRadio,Suckish,Schickshan,17-Jan-12,1,I am upset that u need a facebook to use this app. I don't have nor need a facebook. This is very unexpected I thought it was going to be just like PANDORA but I was wrong.
iHeartRadio,Love all the talk stations,Sue Delovio,22-Dec-16,5,"Listen to talk radio in bed at night w/earbud. No static, I live out in the country. My am radio had such poor reception. This has been such a great change for me ( don't get much  sleep)."

iHeartRadio,great,Laxerias,16-Jan-14,5,"This app is great for listening to your favourite artists, and also for finding new songs and artists that you wouldn't have found other wise, it is allot like real radio, it doesn't suck to one artist the entire time, and you can't just listen to the same song over and over, all in all, I believe it is allot like Pandora, even though I haven't used Pandora ... people need to actually use the app for awhile and figure out out before they try to rate it though. I've been using this for ... actually, I'm not sure how long now, a little over a year, and I love it"

iHeartRadio,Will not play on Kindle Fire,RJ Sturgill,23-Jan-16,1,Will not play on Kindle Fire
iHeartRadio,It's sucky,JackieJaclyn,7-Jul-16,1,"I checked out the terms of agreements because a 1 star review by T. Shrats and it says that it can charge me whenever and I can't do anything about it, and I was just listening to some music and it kept on freezing up. And by just, I mean right before I wrote this sentence. So I feel like I Heart Radio is a way to make money, by charging innocent consumers random fees. Also to make your own stations you have to sign up. I guess I'll keep on looking for free music apps because this one is sucky and scammy. I guess it's back to musica until I find one that doesn't need Wi-fi. Because I totally don't recommend this app."
iHeartRadio,Love it,mees,16-Feb-13,5,It works great and I love being able to get stations I want.  I also like being able to select certain genres of music.
iHeartRadio,Good Radio App - Recommended,C. Hill,7-Mar-12,4,"This iHeartRadio app provides access to hundreds of streaming radio stations covering just about every genre. While I used Facebook to register, it does support an e-mail alternative. I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said, the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can't receive locally. The app installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.Recommended!CFH"
iHeartRadio,Home caring,Sheri Smith,20-Feb-15,5,I love the fact that it doesn't cost to listen to the radio. Especially since I'm not in my car and I can here it on my kindle fire while I'm doing housework or surfing the web.. I even use it sometimes to help my husband sleep at night. He has PTSD from the army. Keep up the excellent company helping people of not changing them. I tell everyone I know and meet about your site.

(I prefer Pandora, please check out and like my review on that) :)"

iHeartRadio,Amazing,Bella,21-Jan-15,5,You never really know what song is going to be next all you know is what radio your playing.  It's a surprise for you plus if you don't like the song then you can skip but one flaw for it is only five skips.  It makes sense so that you can at least make it where you try to branch out to other songs.  I for one love it it's a great app just make sure you have some source of network around.

For Me it's a music app for an alarm clock for school or just chilling with friends....it is definitely worth the process of getting apps in the Appstore. I would recommend this app out of Pandora or Slacker. It seems the most user friendly. And it's great for school or something else. If you don't want to waste more of your battery than put a sleep timer on! ITS just one to get so I highly recommend this app for you! :)
iHeartRadio,Love it!!!,mrsrealle,17-Jul-14,5,"After having to remove YouTube from my 9 year old daughter's Kindle for watching inappropriate videos, this app offers an excellent alternative.

The app itself is good, but I want to be able to make an account so that I can make custom stations.Besides the occasional commercial, the app is good, and doesn't buffer. Would recommend once the account service starts to work."

iHeartRadio,Stop buffering!,Rachel B.,27-Mar-13,1,"When I first installed this app, I was impressed by the option to search for your favourite station or artist. So after searching for my absolute favourite artist, I was amazing when it made a customizable playlist which I played (so far so good) and then it just stopped and buffered itself. I thought, okay, I can wait a minute or two. Nope, the dumb thing kept buffering. It's been two hours now and I think I'll just uninstall and get TuneIn radio instead."

iHeartRadio,92.1 Joe Daily was not a nice person,Perfect,25-Jun-16,1,Joe Daily seems to only like people of certain backgrounds as long as they are not doing something great in life. I hired 92.1 in the hudson valley to record a commercial and part of the package deal was he was suppose to interview me on his radio show. He decided not to follow up with me as it was clear he was not comfortable with certain people being in certain positions. His conduct was beyond rude.

Who the heck cares? We are not all a bunch of mindless followers of the past, hanging on every little bit of info on every rock and roll bad who ever existed! It is mind bending and TMI.

iHeartRadio,Pretty Great,NT Nerd,26-Nov-13,5,"This app is pretty great if you are looking for an app that allows you to construct a radio station that will play songs similar to your choice of music. If you're looking for a playlist or a Spotify sort of app, look elsewhere. What I was impressed by was the lack of ads that a normal radio station would have, so you're able to listen to a constant stream of music, even if you're unable to choose exactly which song comes next. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; don't give it a bad rating because you're looking for something else."

iHeartRadio,Bummed.,Lia Burres,23-Jul-14,2,It would never load on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I was heart broken.  My brother listens to it on his computer all the time.  I really wanted to be able to use this app to hear music when I'm working on something away from my desk.  I was a bit bummed that it wouldn't work.

iHeartRadio,ok,Kindleuser,25-Aug-14,1,"This app is ok. In order to get the songs you want you have to set up an account. It bugs out most of the time,making me wait for the music when I have apps open. It's really not worth it. Maybe it's just my kindle but really I would go for Pandora. Also you only have a limited amount of skips on the radio if a song comes on. Just go to Pandora."

Thrilled I can get my favorite station now when I return home (hated it when I moved and lost my  favorite Classic Rock station). It is also great that I can customize specific artists and ""their stations"" play similar style music."
iHeartRadio,Needs work!,Laura,5-Sep-17,1,This new app is horrible! It makes it impossible to thumbs down or share your opinion in a time efficient manner. Most of the time if you want to switch stations it goes all the way to the home screen. Very frustrated. Very in UNHappy !

iHeartRadio,Great,Katy001,7-Sep-12,5,"This is a great app. I love the build-your-own station aspect of it. I used Pandora for quite some time, but the commercials are so jarring, and the variety is mediocre after you get about 30 songs liked. I haven't gotten to experiment very much with the iHeart alternative to that, but I'm hopeful. Also love that I can listen to radio stations anywhere in the country. Being 1500 miles from home at college, I get a little homesick now and then, and it's nice to reconnect with my hometown through music."
iHeartRadio,I love it! A little confusing but still awesome!!,"If you get this rate it,",29-Jun-15,5,"The best songs are on kids Nick but adventure the song albums. It's only my opinion, but all the best songs are on that album. ANYWAYS, I recommend you get this app, you can listen to it as you play other games, when your on the web, but I havnt Reyes to listen while I don't have any wifi. I guess you can figure that out!! :D  Try this out, it's great app! Get it and find the best albums and share it to the world, that's the reason why I'm doing this now. :)"
iHeartRadio,Great,Joe A.,24-Sep-17,5,Great app. I have it installed on all my devices.
iHeartRadio,Love It,bailey,30-Jul-13,4,The music is perfect and you don't need a facebook if you want to save your playlist you just need and email. The coverage is great. I just couldn't get the alarm or music timer.
iHeartRadio,Hi,Amazon Customer,22-Oct-17,5,I like this app
iHeartRadio,Iheart radio app,Blacksmith,21-Dec-12,1,"I am pretty disappointed in the Iheart radio app. I have loaded it on my iphone and tried it out for several hours. I tried to get Christmas music and it didn't do very well the first few songs were rap versions of Christmas and it would then not let me skip the ones I didn't like. I tried instrumental which by definition should not contain any vocals and within a couple of songs came up with vocals I was able to skip the first few then I hit the skip limit. I tried several other ""stations"" like Mannheim steamroller and soon had rap again. I then tried Trans Siberian and ended up after a few songs with some pretty heavy hard rock and techno rock. Which is fine but not what I had asked for. I had a lot better luck with Pandora in the past. I may have to reload Pandora and use it instead."
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,TD Nelson,5-Jul-17,5,Nice app for listening to out of town radio stations
iHeartRadio,AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!!,Mary Sanchez,9-May-12,5,Have no idea why some people are not liking this awesome app. You DO NOT need a facebook to use it as others have stated. Have had no problems on my kindle fire. There is even an option that provides you the lyrics to the song you are listening to. If you don't want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!
iHeartRadio,Better than Pandora,Carl D. Bennington,25-May-13,5,"I used to subscribe (paided for it) to Pandora just to listen commercial free. iHeartRadio is commercial free for free in addition to being able to listen to local radio stations. Now when friends in other states tell me about this or that great radio station that they have in their listening area, I can tune-in and see what they are listening to also. I use iHeartRadio on my tablets, my iPhone, and on my streaming enabled TV...IMHO SO much better than Pandora or Yahoo Music."
iHeartRadio,Good app !!!!!!,Bob.,4-Sep-17,5,"One of the best on-line ""radio"" apps."
iHeartRadio,Alexa and I Heart Radio,RFP,25-Mar-17,5,Love IHeart Radio and now Alexa can play it for me.

I can have all my favorite artists (like Train) on one playlist, or I can look at one of their &#34;Perfect For&#34; lists for a compilation of themed tunes. I encourage you to get this wonderful application as soon as you find the time to. It really is worth having."
iHeartRadio,"NO Facebook required, but update is still bad.......",PigPen4x4,3-May-12,3,"OK boys and girls, I use this a lot (well used to)and I do NOT log into FB to do it.BUT! All I do is listen to a certain radio station, so your mileage may vary.Now tha bad;I had a earlier version, (don't know which) and LOVED it!This version is unusable after a forced update.With my Samsung Epic, (Sprint) it clips the audio, a lot. 2 to 5 or more seconds at a time.Sometimes 10 times per minute.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it ain't the station.The previous version didn't do it, so I don't thinks it's my phone.Please fix this, as I love listening to ""The Big Show"" in the mornings!!!!!ChristopherUPDATEIt works much better now, I guess it updated again.So I'll give 'er 3 stars.C."

I don't know if I have the update or not because I can't replay the songs or make my OWN playlist. I tried uninstalling it and downloading it, but it didn't work. Am I missing something? Somebody please help me."
iHeartRadio,"USED TO be may favorite app.  Now, it doesn't work.",Ed,24-Jun-15,1,"I use this a lot (or rather I used to).  It was my favorite Kindle app.  The app has an alarm that turns on my favorite morning station at 7am every weekday.  I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening (as I worked around the house) until lunch time. (Both are News/Talk stations).  My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem (""Daaaad...  my Kindle isn't working right..."").Several updates ago (about a month or so), it just stopped working.  When it does turn on (it's not reliable as an alarm anymore), it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing.  I have to close the app (or stop the station) and then hit play again.  It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked.  Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I don't really use my Kindle Fire HD.  Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest version(s) just don't work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it's not the station.  The previous version didn't do it, so I don't think it's my Kindle (besides, other radio apps and Audible all work fine).  If I switch to PC, it seems to work (no perfectly, but mostly) fine.  I'm sure it was an unintended consequence of a new feature or fixing some other problem, but THIS APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW.  :("

iHeartRadio,Was Not Accessable in My Region and Was Disappointed!,Annisa Arthur,11-Sep-14,2,"I am not able to access this app in my region of the Caribbean and was sorely disappointed as such.I think it is high time that Amazon starts finding ways of zoning their customers and offering them only products and services that can be accessed in their region, so as to avoid disappointment.It will surely set them apart from other online stores."

iHeartRadio,Frequent interruptions,Man o 'tides,25-Jun-14,2,"I like iHeartRadio when it works.It seems to have cycles where it will be fine for a while and then goes into ""interruption mode"".I have learned to always have my old, analog, Sony walkman battery operated AM/FM handy when this happens.At times transmission was interrupted so frequently I gave up and went to solely to my dependable Sony.This doesn't seem to be nearly the problem with TuneIn radio.The only reason I use IHeart Radio at all is  that they carry a sports talk station I can't get on TuneIn radio."

Anytime I am connected to internet u bet I am on I heart Radio. Plz download u will love it. U r going to have to right a essay on this app because it is soooooooo awesome. I am listening to the app right now as I am typing this. Best app ever. Don't tell Pandora that I said this but I listen to this WAY more than that app.
iHeartRadio,Amazing,Mark,20-Mar-12,5,"This app was so worth it. I have always loved the radio, and was shocked when I got a station from across the country! Plus the custom stations had my favorite artists and songs so I can listen to what I want, when I want. This app is amazing and if you download it you won't regret it!"
iHeartRadio,Wow!,Amazing!,14-Jun-17,5,This app is AMAZING! I use it everytime I go to sleep. My favorite stations are Taylor Swift Radio and Justin Bieber Radio.
iHeartRadio,best music app,beachgirl89,10-May-14,5,I love this app I like listening to old school rock and rap and it always has the best selection and even songs I didn't think they would have like Lenny Williams. Better than Pandora even the ads are better cause they aren't in the way and you don't have to listen  to them like Pandora makes you do...love  it....hope one yea  I can go to the festival....definitely Reccomend. I love playing it while I'm in the shower getting ready for work best motivation is good music in the early mornings...download now!!!!!!
iHeartRadio,"Don't like ads, but love the app!",sonya gordon,22-Nov-16,4,"Don't like the occasional ads, but I've only had it for 2 days and I've been listening to comedy, holiday music, and acapella like my favorite group straight no chasers!"

iHeartRadio,eh,D. Walth,6-Dec-15,3,It would be nice if when u choose an artist it would only play that artist .... But it works pretty well although every time I click the app on my kindle fire hd6 the type in ur zip code always shows up and doesn't like going away .... Otherwise its great
iHeartRadio,My favorite radio stations whenever I want them!,MaryG,27-Nov-12,4,"I don't have a radio in the house anymore so it's great to have the option of my favorite radio stations, coming in loud & clear, whether they're local or far away. Growing up, whenever I drove upstate NY, I always remembered tuning into a local Poughkeepsie rock station. It's still going strong and the music is still great!My only suggestion is to get more stations involved. Couldn't find one from the NJ shore or my old college station that now plays jazz."
iHeartRadio,Best Music app!!,audra wallace,2-Apr-15,5,This music lets you pick what kind of music you like. Then you can pick your favorite artists. Also you can play games while you listen to music. I love this app. You get reminders if it needs an update. Also you get cool stuff on your email like if there is something special going on. All in all I think you should get this app.
iHeartRadio,iHeartRadio,F. Thompson,21-Mar-14,4,"I can easily locate and enjoy stations that I want to listen to.  However, the transmission periodically stops for periods  ranging from a few seconds to several minutes.  I have also encountered  times when I Heart Radio has or is attempting to disconnect.  I do not know if the problem is with the origination point, transmission connections or final internet connection but it can be frustrating at times."
iHeartRadio,Awesome,Sierra,16-May-17,5,I love this app so much you should try it!
iHeartRadio,"Like the APP, hate the commercials.",M Raines,27-May-14,3,"I love the convenience of being able to listen to the radio shows, I would otherwise be missing. However,  the commercials are brutal. Sadly, I'm use to commercials,  they have unfortunately invaded everything. But if I have to listen to a countdown of the top songs by Stone Temple Pilots one more time, I think I might shoot myself. The countdowns annoy me so much, I usually just end up turning it off by the first or second set of commercials."
iHeartRadio,More Stations Please,lynnd,11-Jan-14,4,"This app is GREAT!  It has everything from R&B, Oldies, Classical, & Country music channels.  Get your earphones out,  the sound is pretty good.  It has News & PBS/NPR channels.  Great!  But sadly the Talk channels are limited to 2 or 3 and they are all Fox-type Right/Tea Party content.  MORE DIVERSE TALK CHANNELS PLEASE IHEART.  So 4 stars for the current Music/News/PBS/NPR channels and 0 stars for the Talk content."

iHeartRadio,WAY COOL!!!,AcePilot77,10-Jan-17,5,I was just recently introduced to I Heart Radio and this is the nicest way to find the type of music that you enjoy. To top it off IT IS FREE!! Does it get any better than that?

iHeartRadio,You should download,Kindle Customer,13-Jul-17,5,It is awesome offline bet you need a account or a Facebook account
iHeartRadio,Thumbs down means thumbs down.,p.haliwell,1-Dec-14,3,"Overall this is a nice app for listening to music. What gripes me the most is that I will see songs that I have disliked keep repeating. The app also doesn't suit my eclectic taste in music. Once I start to get a radio station with a good amount of my favorite music, I increase my variety only to get songs that 70% of the time I end up disliking."
iHeartRadio,All the best songs i grew up listening to.,erik berg,22-Dec-16,5,"Can't stop listening, i even bought a portable blue tooth speaker that i keep with me all the time."

iHeartRadio,"Great app, best music app I've tried.",Lori and Mike C.,2-Apr-16,4,Great app! Like that you can create your own stations suited to your personal taste in music. Didn't rate 5_ŸŒ due to the frequent freezing up in the middle of a good song otherwise it's most user friendly music app I've tried. _Ÿ’–
iHeartRadio,My favorite music app.,Yoshiko,28-Sep-13,5,"This app is fantastic. You get to pick and choose what kind of radio ""station"" you want by choosing a specific artist, song, or genre. It's just like Pandora, but better. There's a short advertisement at the very beginning of choosing your station but that's it. I love the clean and modern look to the app also. I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone who doesn't really want to spend money on music."
iHeartRadio,Fabulous app!!!,Carolyn,30-Sep-14,5,"Exposure to new (to me) artists, sports teams I love, and so much more.  I really didn't realize the scope of iheartradio until now.  LOVE it!!!!"
iHeartRadio,in love,loveyahwehfirst,28-Jul-14,5,"ive always hated mainstream radio because of all of the commercials. I found out about this app through a family member and when I found out that kindle fire had the same app, I knew it would be my new favorite app. iheartradio gives you the freedom to create your own station(s) or discover ones you never knew existed. I love this app because if you create your own station, the only commercial you will get is at the start. I reccomend this app to every music lover."
iHeartRadio,Great sounds,Louann Shay,4-Dec-16,5,The best radio around and if you get tired of one station you can switch to another very easy.

iHeartRadio,FANtastic,Buckeyetater,30-Apr-13,5,I am a big fan of talk radio and have limited musical variety that I enjoy cuz hey I'm gettin old. This app allows me to listen to all my favorite talk hosts and pick my music by creating my own stations. I hope they don't see a need to ever change this app to make it better because its FANtastic just the way it is. It is so easy to use and navigate that even an old fart like me can figure it out with ease. I haven't ever had any major issues in reception errors. This is my favorite app by far.
iHeartRadio,Best Music App I've ever Had!,carlos cordova,7-Apr-16,5,This is a great app! They is many stations to listen to!

iHeartRadio,Four Stars,Shark,9-Nov-15,4,I like this radio but for me Pandora works better.
iHeartRadio,Best Radio Music App,Hector Rivera,15-Oct-14,5,"I think this is the best radio app out there currently. I just put it on and let it roll. I like and dislike what I listen to. After awhile it sort of learns the songs I like and plays them. I leave the setting to mix so once in a while I have to vote on a new song. My music choice is rather mix, so this is perfect for listening to many music genres in one place (for free). It does required a good connection for use. Have not tested other features to buy music or set up stations, but this is my music app of choice. Pandora is a close second."
iHeartRadio,Bring back PERFECT FOR!!!!,Malachi Harris,22-Jan-17,2,If they wouldn't have tooken away the PERFECT FOR tab I actually would've paid for this app now I'm deleting it bc it's useless _Ÿ˜‘ if they decide to bring the option back then I'll redownload and pay for the monthly subscription. I've had this app since day one drop SMH

iHeartRadio,It's great!,Lindsey,28-Jan-14,5,"I love this app because you can create your own stations and listen to the music that you want. I especially like the 'perfect for' option, where they have different themes for different days. For example, Sunday evening you could pick relaxing, candlelight dinner, dancing, or video games music, but that's not even all of the options! This app works perfectly on the kindle fire. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music."
iHeartRadio,One of the best,Sheri J.,8-Nov-16,5,This app is one of the best for music with lots of songs
iHeartRadio,I heart radio is not free,Ron Urbanski,20-Oct-17,1,"It's only free for 30 days, they miss lead you."
iHeartRadio,Love It,camionnette,21-Nov-12,5,My son told me about the iHeartRadio app and I love it! The great thing is I can scan stations and not lose my original station. Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream.
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,B. Powers,30-Apr-17,5,Love it.
iHeartRadio,BEST,Ruth,15-Dec-16,5,I downloaded this for my ill sis and she absolutely just LOVED it and I love it too so I rate it 5 stars_Ÿ˜_
iHeartRadio,My favorite streaming music app,Amazon Customer,5-Jan-13,5,"I really like this app. You don't need to sign in through Facebook like others are saying, you are given an option to make a free account with them Or sign in through Facebook. I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc.I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well.  If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
iHeartRadio,Buy this app its awsome,Makenzie,12-Jul-16,5,You can create your own stations based on music you like it can't get any better I'm glad I switched to I_Ÿ’– Radio by it its the best_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’™

My favorite local radio station was sold and converted to talk radio.  Very, very disappointing.  There's no other station to take its place, so this gives me a very pleasant replacement, at least while I'm home."
iHeartRadio,I heart I heart!,astonish me,1-Dec-16,5,The best  for those of us who are radio and music addicts!
iHeartRadio,Its really good,Jazmen,27-Jul-17,5,"This is the best radio station app I have ever tried. They have all my favorite radio stations and great custom stations. The only station that I couldn't find was channel 94.1, and I wish they would add it. Everything else about the app is great. _Ÿ˜€"
iHeartRadio,Great for most things,Anthony Herpolsheimer,3-May-15,4,"I listen to this app more than anything else.  Only down side is some streaming radio channels like The Blaze won't play continuously.  I thought maybe it was a signal strength issue till I streamed these changes from their web site and they played without issue.  If they could stream live feeds more reliably, it would be a 5 star app for sure."

iHeartRadio,Not good on BlackBerry 10,beaglerock,12-Jan-17,1,"Selection of music is great, my only gripe is that it doesn't automatically go to the next song as it did in the past. In order to advance to the next song I have to physically pick up phone and tap next. Could be my phone but Pandora doesn't have this problem."

iHeartRadio,kick ass app.,Forest Bubba Gump,9-Nov-14,5,"I have been using this app for a while and I can say it's the best music app out there, it has all the options to listen to whatever kind of music you are into and you can build a custom station mine is ""Shinedown Radio"" it plays avenged sevenfold, godsmack and a bunch more artist like them. Just get the app I promise you'll love it, the only con I can think of is it consumes battery and data maybe a little to much for mobile phones."

iHeartRadio,Wonderful,One,7-Dec-16,5,Perfect in all respects
iHeartRadio,Was amazing before the update,ally,8-Apr-14,3,"Ever since my kindle fire has updated this, Iheartradio has become a disappointment. I will be listening to a song and the app will close, I will constantly reopen it and it will play for a while, then close again. It has become obnoxious after the seemingly thousandth time of this happening. It is nice if you just want music as your background and you leave the app open while your cleaning, but other than that it's upsetting.Off to try Pandora"

They got some cheap MP3 players from a relative for Christmas and were all excited until after the batter ran down the first time we couldn't recharge them.  I spent a great deal of time trying to decide whether to replace with MP3 players, ipods, ipads, .....  We already had a kindle and we are all sharing it, so after some consideration and test driving iHeartRadio, I decided to get them kindles."

For some reason, every time I try to open it, it tells me ""iheartradio has stopped"", I've spent more time trying to get it to work than actually using it! Done everything tech support has told me to do, even tried uninstalling. If this is supposed to be the best radio app ever it sucks. I'm very VERY disappointed!! It got 2 stars for the sheer fact that the UI was good & easy to use and when the app worked it was great & played all my favorites. Fix the force close and you have 5 stars from me."

iHeartRadio,iHeartMedia Right Wing strategy,d'Vre,22-Jun-15,1,"Due to iHeartMedia's delivery of right-wing, conservative talk radio, I will be deleting this app from my devices.

iHeartRadio,THE BEST,Steven C Patterson,22-Aug-14,5,"I had Pandora for the longest time until I found iHeartradio, now I use this ALL the time so many radios, you can listen to radios that are going on on the actual RADIO :0 not by setting the am/cm but by choosing them by name, and then, like Pandora you can listen to song and artist radios but unlike pandora, you can make stations &#34;Favorite Stations&#34; that you can access from the menu on the side. I use it for relaxation, and exercising.  .Best Music App Ever."
iHeartRadio,Great app,Jamie,17-Dec-15,4,"The app works well for the most part, but crashes when I use other apps/web while running it. It also periodically freezes. I consider myself easy going enough not to let something like a few crashes ruin my day so I'm still giving it 4 stars. Overall it's a good app."

iHeartRadio,Best radio App out there.,Adam,9-Jun-14,4,"I was a Pandora user like most of us, that was until they had a 6 song limit or whatever it was. I HEART is a good App that is  100% free and you can find just about any radio station you're looking for.  I moved to Houston about two years ago and Houston is where I reside now. The one thing I missed most was the music.  I found both of my favorite Hawaiian reggae stations on IHEARTRADIO. So I am able to keep up with the new jams comin out of Hawai'i! It's a blessing!"

iHeartRadio,Amazing!!!!!,Amazon Customer,9-Mar-14,5,"I believe this is way better than Pandora or Slacker radio. So far, I haven't seen any limits in skipping or time. It rarely buffers, skips, or crashes. I also haven't seen one song play twice and I have found many new bands that I have never even heard of that I absolutely love! I look at all of the bad rated reviews and they look like personal problems or user error. Nothing wrong with the app itself."

iHeartRadio,This is the one,Ivy,1-Apr-14,5,"I love iHeartRadio. I used to use Pandora but the format changed and I was highly disappointed. This radio app is more tailored to the artist or band you want to hear. Unlike Pandora as of late, when you listen to iHeartRadio you actually hear the artist or band you originally created the station for. This is a definite must have for music lovers, I have it on my home computer, phone and most recently my Kindle Fire HD."

However, they don't have some of the live stations I listen to all the time, and the alarm clock feature doesn't always work. Despite these minor difficulties, if you are looking for an app where you can listen to music, I suggest this one."

I had to continuously download the little shellfish app, but now my frets have been put at ease.  I adore the iheart radio app, to say the least.  Thanks to this app I can listen to music all the time, but here's the catch... it's my kind of music that plays for my moods.  And being woman, I have a constant merry go round of mood swings.  So thanks for the fantastic app, for all the Moody people roaming the Earth."
iHeartRadio,I love this app,Dragondarkness,19-Apr-14,5,I literally listen to it everyday it gets a lot of use on my Kindle.

I slept for a year and a half for 18 -20 hours a day.  I have always had music in my life.  My parents would play it in the car, house, records, my brothers & sister would pretend to be in a band and use out funiture for drums, keyboards, etc., I was always listening.  So now that IHeart Radio is available on my computer, cell phone, & kindle, I have started listening again.  It is clear, easy, and comforting."

iHeartRadio,iHeart radio is not heartless radio.,Thomas Johns,14-May-13,3,"Listened to iHeart radio and it was a decent experience. I was easily able to access the bands and radio stations I wanted to listen to. That says a lot right there, because I am not a computer savvy person. I listened for two hours one day while scrubbing the house. iHeart radio did not interrupt the music with meaningless ads, and there weren't any banner ads, or general garbage covering  my Kindle screen. I wasn't seriously thrilled with the listening experience, because iHeart played songs I did not listen to from the Awesome 80's."

Peloza,26-Sep-14,5,"I was introduced to this Station by two different people and I absolutely love it. I especially like the idea of sleeping with it and waking up to it in the morning. Just like I did with old radios when I was growing up with the snooze. You can not be disappointed because their is all kinds of stations for everybody.

iHeartRadio,I like this app and the stations it has to choose from or create. but...,James,28-May-15,3,"I like this app and the stations it has to choose from or create. The only thing I hate is that many of these stations are like on a loop recorded feed and repeat a lot of the content. If you listen for a few hours, some stations will recycle through the same playlists, and same DJ rhetoric as the previous hours or days before. It is not always live, but a good app for music overall."
iHeartRadio,Free and Internet Radio,John Skeene,21-Jul-14,5,"I really like this music app so much. When I am not gaming, writing, reading, or just want to listen to the internet radio I turn on my iHeart. I select the genre and stations thta I want or the app can make suggestions for you.I usually pick a few local stations for hard rock and some distant stations also. You dont have to log on to your Facebook Account when setting it up, just skip for later."
iHeartRadio,AMAZING!!!,K. Martinez,8-Jan-15,5,This app is amazing due to its ability to play the music you love based on what you like and don't like.

iHeartRadio,"Dont skip, if she Alexa says "" no more skipping songs"".....or else.",Hathas Malvena,4-Nov-16,3,"Wow....I skipped about 6 songs...Alexa said, "" you cannot skip any more songs for 1 hr "".  I asked about 3 times more, then Alexa said "" you cannot skip any more songs for 24 hrs"".  Really?  I am not 5 yrs old, and Alexa is not my mother....this is NOT COOL AT ALL.  Not only that. but if I have friends over...who skip songs ....next thing I know I lose my skip privilege for 24 hrs.  I wonder what she will say if I continue to ask to skip......Although I appreciate the free music...its not playing anything in the same Genre that I originally asked.  Maybe the first few songs...I was listening to Classic Rock songs, now some Jazz....and I cant skip.  Thanks."

It will work again after I restart the app but it'll eventually crash again. It's just annoying whenever I'm listening to a great song and then have to restart the app because then the song changes. I don't know if this happens with other devices lately but it didn't do this with my Kindle Fire or Optimus U, but it crashes with my Galaxy S Aviator. Please fix this problem!"

iHeartRadio,I Don't Know,Beachgirl,16-Jun-12,3,"I would have loved to get this app. I have Pandora now, but my cousin had this app and said it was great. I was so excited to get it. I read the reviews to see what everyone else was saying first though. I didn't realize you had thlo log into facebook. Sure, I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio, but it shows what you're listening to. I'm not going to download it because I don't want my friends to know what I'm listening to. If you want my opinion, just get Pandora. It's free and all you need is an email."
iHeartRadio,"This app used to be great, but for the last month glitches have increased ...",Deliah Reedle,6-Jan-15,1,"This app used to be great, but for the last month glitches have increased and in the past two days it is almost unbearable.  I can tolerate listening to the same commercials over and over again but when trying to listen to fox sports radio live streaming, it has been getting interrupted, multiple repeats then jumping ahead.  Aweful!!"
iHeartRadio,don't like,Barbara Cerone,31-Jan-14,2,"too confusing and no guidelines for use.  I thought I could get several of my favorite talk radio shows on my kindle fire. Many host I listen to show streaming live on their websites, but when I try to get them on I heart radio I can't.Also how do I delete items I don't waant or were put on when I asked for something else.  I requested Michael Barry talk show and received music by someone named Michael Barry.Not happy with this product as all"
iHeartRadio,Amazing Radio App,Amazon Customer,16-Feb-17,5,This app has such a variety to choose from. You can listen to whatever music is suiting for you at that time. This app is just a great app to have when you want to listen to any kind of music.
iHeartRadio,I love this app.,gf,20-Sep-13,5,I love this app. I can listen to different types of music all in one place. Also can hear what's going on near family & friends. It's also easy to create your own station. Thank you.
iHeartRadio,Great radio from all over the country.,Otila,13-Dec-16,5,A great way to listen to live radio from all over the country. I listen to radio from Hawaii.
iHeartRadio,A great alternative to Pandora....,Joel D.,30-Jun-13,5,"Not only can you stream live radio from anywhere, but you can create your own stations based upon an artist or band. It has a great feature that allows you to dial in very similar to not-so-similar artists and you can 'sculpt' the character of the station by rating a particular song, thumbs up/down. AND you can play outside the US. Pandora? NO! Also, you can get great information about the artist, and follow links to buy material."
iHeartRadio,Wonderful with my new Kindle Fire,Elyssanda Desertsong,26-Nov-11,5,"Beautiful streaming music without any problems. Dh is already hooked on using this app. Anytime we're in the house, he says ""Put on one of those Christmas stations please"". I told him he needs to Dl it for his iPad, but he's a lazybones."
iHeartRadio,Pandora sucks I Heart radio the bome,Terrell,19-Jun-14,5,This is way better than pandora now bc u don't need to upgrade to the paid app for the advertisement at the bottom or any commercial free .or do I heart radio support commercial .but so far it's pretty good app to me
iHeartRadio,great but,Amazon Customer,9-Jul-14,5,I got it it is a thousand times better easier to find music then Pandora Pandora is okay compared to iheartradio but for each song you can skip so many times then you have to go to the web site but even then I don't get more but I still give it a five star rating I can listen to New music I've never heard and find new songs that I like look at the good side!!! :-)
iHeartRadio,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,10-Jun-17,5,Easy to use.
iHeartRadio,WORST APP ON MY PHONE EVER,Jeff Hall,16-May-13,1,"This app usually crashes within the first minute of using it. It will lose the station signal and then search and not find it again. SOmetimes it will wait 15 to 60 seconds, find the signal and then drop it again, hen repeat the process.  Other similar apps such as TuneIn do not have this issue at all on my phone and are far better apps..  With I Heart Radio, I can be sitting two feet from a wi fi feed and it still drops the station and can't find it. Same issue if I am not near a wi fi and using cellular signal.  It also locks up on my desktop or laptop and drops stations, etc. I like the talk show personalities carried by I Heart Radio but cannot stand the app. It is extremely irritating.  I contacted I Heart Radio and they were of no help at all.  If I had other apps behave the same way I would suspect there is something wrong with my phone, but they all work like they are supposed to without a glitch.  It is more irritating to try to make this app actually work than to miss the shows I like to listen to.  An awful app with awful customer support to go along with it."

iHeartRadio,almost perfect,Krevick,11-Dec-13,4,"This app is almost perfect. Lots of great music and stations. However, when you create your own station, you have little control over what plays. I was listening to three days grace, when it started playing Nickleback, which I personaly don't enjoy. Also, there is a daily skip limit, so when you get a bunch of songs you don't like, you can't skip all of them. In the end, if you want to listen to specific music, this is not for you."

iHeartRadio,Starts up too fast,jocmarsh,2-Oct-12,3,I find this application a little difficult to use. Start up screen just flashes real quickly on my tablet and then the screen goes to the last station I was listening to. Going to the menu screen I don't see any option to go back to the home screen where I can select stations. I don't find the help section to be very helpful at all.  The application itself works great but I find it difficult to use.
iHeartRadio,Local stations are not all available -- WHY? ? ? ?,PatC,20-Oct-15,1,"Boston AM radio station WRKO 680 is NOT AVAILABLE ! ! ! ! !  WHY ? ? ?  Also the number and length of commercials is awful.  They take over (i.e. completely lock up)  your ipod, iphone, etc."

iHeartRadio,"Live LOUD, Play HARD",Silverblitz,5-Sep-12,1,"Boycott all things Clear Channel owned.  Clear Channel took away the ONLY rock station in Atlanta and replaced it with yet another bubble-gum pop station.  Atlanta already has at least FIVE other stations JUST like it.  They took away Project 9-6-1 leaving countless Project Family members without a radio home.  Clear Channel is a greedy corporation who blatantly refuses to listen to its customers and is only interested in filling their pockets with money.  Do what's right and help us Project Family members get our station back.  Don't download this app!  We're not asking for a whole lot.  We just want to rock on.  Is that so much to ask for?To Clear Channel:  Screw you!  Your ways of marketing are horrendous.  Keep your customers in mind.  Bring back our Project 9-6-1 and leave us the flip alone.  Take that bubble-gum pop crap station off our rock station!  If you think our anger will just fizzle out and fade away, you are horribly, horribly wrong.  The longer you go without listening to us, the harder we will fight back.  We live by one simple rule.  We live LOUD and we play HARD.Keep rocking on Project members!"

iHeartRadio,Almost there...,a person,21-Sep-17,3,"The app was fine and I love how you can pick a station and listen to music from that artist or genre, but what I don't like is that I cannot choose individual songs, whenever I go to the search bar and type in a song and tap on it, it plays the station and it is just random luck whether or not I get the song I want."

iHeartRadio,An illusion.....,Rivertender,28-Apr-16,1,Connectivity is awful.......buffers and drops signal constantly .Ads. Ads. Ads.  A withering amount of ads before you even hear moment one of the radio ststion you ve chosen.Not even an option anymore.
iHeartRadio,NICE,DGM9594,5-Aug-17,5,I can listen to Rush every weekday morning.
iHeartRadio,The iHeartRadio App is great,Amazon Customer,1-Feb-12,5,For all of those that are saying you need a Facebook...you don't. I do not have a Facebook. I can listen to the radio stations just fine. The only reason you need to have a Facebook account is if you want to save the radio stations as a favorite. It does not interfere at all with choosing a radio station and listening to the amazing music! I can listen to local radio stations or I can listen to stations all over the US. There are many stations for each genre of music as well. I love this app. There is nothing better than a free app to listen to music anytime I want to!
iHeartRadio,best music streaming app,Scrutinizing Shopper,6-Apr-14,5,I used to use tune in but it kept crashing. iheartradio hasn't crashed and the music selection and stations are fantastic.

iHeartRadio,Efficient and comfortable,Copntrainn,28-Jan-16,4,"Tried so many other sites and it was repeat after repeats.  This app has far out succeeded the other sites and I haven't heard one dang commercial yet.  4 stars for content only because for some reason it just stops playing music, that frustrates me quite a bit. I usually have to power it off to make it work right again."
iHeartRadio,Love it & Doesn't need facebook!,G. Schmidt,13-Jun-12,5,"Love this app so much! It lets you choose what genre you want and then which station to listen too. Also, you can create great playlists.And I want to clarify, you don't need a facebook you can sign up easily with your email."

iHeartRadio,Clear (Rear) Channel is the Anti-Christ.  Boycott Clear (Rear) Channel,R. Milligan,5-Sep-12,1,"Clear Channel has pulled the the plug on the ONLY rock station in Atlanta to replace it with a bubble-gum pop station in which there is already 5 others playing the same garbage.  96.1 has been the ONLY hard rock station in Atlanta since 1974.  They ban us from making comments on the new radio stations facebook page, and otherwise just suck hard.  The Project family is awaiting the posting of the new sponsors and we will form a new party in Atlanta called BoycottPaluza!  You are either part of the Project or part of the problem!  Hows the project family been treating you so far Rear Channel?  Get used to it, can't wait to get the sponsors list!"

iHeartRadio,"Poor sound quality, needs Facebook",Tom Servo,2-Feb-12,2,"The sound quality of the stations are sub par, whether on 3G or wifi.  The Facebook integration is necessary for certain features, which is annoying.  Frankly, they should have left their streams available to third parties like TuneIn Radio, because that app is a million times better than this."

iHeartRadio,Monopolistic.,Josh,2-Sep-12,1,"This is a terrible application, indicative of the current state of radio.  Why do I need to download a proprietary app to listen to a radio station?  Why can't I surf to a website and stream from there?  Information.  Nobody is listening to garbage radio anymore and they need ratings information so they can sell you a new mattress.  Plus it's buggy.  Don't give in."
iHeartRadio,music at my fingertips!!,marieb,6-Sep-12,5,Really enjoy iheart radio!!  I can have all my favorite music and favorite kinds of music available to me on my Kindle Fire.
iHeartRadio,facebook requirement,Matt S,5-Sep-12,1,this thing wants a facebook account. really? come up with a new plan. I never give apps access to facebook. creates too many security and privacy issues. never chain accounts together! a hacker may gain access to one just to go after the others.
iHeartRadio,Since I'm not a loser I can't use it?,Joemomma,9-Aug-12,1,"Since I choose not to put my business online to a bunch of fake ""friends"" I can't create a station? Some of us can still think for ourselves and don't care that little skyler or caleb ate all his veggies. Shame on you. ihate this crap."
iHeartRadio,facebook,eil,8-Sep-12,1,"I wouldnt mind creating a regular account if so asked. The Facebook requirement is, unfortunately, a deal breaker for me."
iHeartRadio,Pandora is better,Ren,3-Feb-12,1,Pandora is better and this seemed worthless.  I'm glad I didn't buy this because the reviews told me enough. I don't have a facebook so this would've been a complete waste.
iHeartRadio,Bad Reviews---Facebook,Isaac Taylor,11-Feb-12,1,I'm going to try Tune-In Radio if these reviews are right in it REQUIRING Facebook access. Just to let ClearChannel know they are missing listeners here because of this.
iHeartRadio,fire,sick cool fire always need my fav tunes,20-Feb-16,5,Radio stuff my fave get some!!!
iHeartRadio,Boycotting...,Zyaldar,5-Sep-12,1,Clear Channel took away the longest running rock station in Atlanta and turned it into a pop station. We now have 5 pop stations and no hard rock. All those stations play the same music. The Project family will not stand for this. We will fight for our Project 9-6-1! Are you ready Clear? Its just going to get worse!
iHeartRadio,Never,Will,25-Nov-16,1,Always says unfortunately I Heart has stopped working. Wish I could give 0 stars.
iHeartRadio,Thanks you guys!,higihuho,11-Jun-12,1,No really.Thank you for the people who gave 1star reviews because I was going to get this but facebook is required.So no way I'm going to get this.
iHeartRadio,Heartradio sucks,Jose G. Araujo,5-Jun-12,1,"heart radio is bad or i don't know it. Its difficuly, no, its impossible to change stations. even to sign in is complicated. you have to sign in with facebook. no way, I give them a zero"
iHeartRadio,recomemded,alannaborders,4-Apr-12,1,I would recomend Pandora because it is better you can listen to the radio but you need internet but it is really awesome!!!!
iHeartRadio,Sucks,Mable,3-Jan-12,1,"This app is ridiculous. I wanted to have it to listen to a local radio station. I have really good service, full bars PLUS a good WiFi connection, and yet its skips its way through everything. Most of the time I'm just listening to dead air, waiting for the song to come back for a only about 3 seconds before it is dead air again. Plus a lot of the time its not even playing the same thing as the radio station that I'm wanting to listen to. What's the point of trying to listen to a radio station when it won't even play what that station is playing. I think I'll just stick with Pandora."
iHeartRadio,DJ Pami,P. D. Wood,18-Feb-12,1,"Amazon should ban Any App requiring Facebook - what were they & clear channel thinking... too bad, really wanted this, Tuned in will have to do until they fix"
iHeartRadio,This app requires Facebook. Enough said. One star until that changes.,Roy N.,21-Feb-12,1,"This app requires Facebook. Enough said. One star until that changes. Why does Amazon require 20 words? I got my point across in less, sorry for the filler."
iHeartRadio,No facebook,Kenan Karamehmedovic,17-May-12,1,I have a facebook account but I still don't want to use any app that requires access. Thanks but no thanks
iHeartRadio,dumb that you need facebook,why do u ned a faccceeeebbbbooookkk????!!,9-Feb-12,1,don't get this if u don't have facebook. I would rather carry around a boombox than this why do u need facebook
iHeartRadio,Facebook Radio?,H. Perez,9-Mar-12,1,"yep. it's true. no Facebook, don't bother, go get Jango from the Market... you WILL thank me.. I promise! better than the mighty Pandora even.."
iHeartRadio,Bring Back PROJECT 96.1,phil,5-Sep-12,1,BRING THE PROJECT BACK TO ATLANTA!!!!!!!!!! LIVE LOUD PLAY HARD!!!!!!The new POWER 96.1 is another crappy top 40 pop sation in Atlanta. My beloved rock music is now gone and I have no good music to listen to. I guess Clear Channel hasnt noticed that there are about three more pop stations in Atlanta.... hmmm clearly makes sense to ad another.. idiots
iHeartRadio,bad requirement,ctheroofer,3-Mar-12,1,should not reqiuire you to have facebook account real let down thought would be good saith all the hips AGAIN strings attached
iHeartRadio,so sick of everything facebook,Lori R.,3-Mar-12,1,I refuse to get anything that requires Facebook. I don't have a Facebook account and refuse to get one. this is ridiculous.

iHeartRadio,Lets me take my home radio station on the road ...,Steve,7-May-15,5,Lets me take my home radio station on the road with me and check out stations in the areas that i'm traveling to.
iHeartRadio,horrible,Mr C,17-Apr-12,1,This app takes forever to load when on WiFi. fails to load when there is only a 4g connection. this app stops play in the middle of songs multiple timess a day even when connected to WiFi.
