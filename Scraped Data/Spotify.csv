Spotify,spotify is great,brittkne,7-Oct-17,5,"Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin  music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
Spotify,Love this app,Vickie,31-Jul-16,5,"I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
Spotify,Novice,Linda Burton,4-Apr-17,5,"I love, love, love spotify !!!!! I'm 71 years and no very computer literate, if I can learn Spotify anyone can. I have found songs I used to listen to 55 years ago."
Spotify,The ony music app you neec,Chris Johnson,7-Mar-17,5,"I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
Spotify,Great for metal fans!,Kindle Customer,13-Nov-17,5,I love this app so much. I can listen to music and I can trust that the bands I like are getting paid for their work. (I use the free version so I experience the occasional ad) So much better than buying iTunes or using youtube for music. As a heavy metal fan some of the bands I like are less popular but I can find them all here. I am amazed some local and lesser known bands are featured on this service. It makes me glad that the ad revenue goes to supporting them in making more great music for my enjoyment.
Spotify,BEST. MUSIC APP. EVER.,Ann Manhire,29-Apr-17,5,Great for listening to your favorite tunes and discovering new ones as well
Spotify,I love it,Lara,24-Apr-17,5,It is such a good app I fecomed this to anyone who love music
Spotify,Best Choice for Music,Jesse,14-Oct-17,5,"Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!"
Spotify,Great app!,Amazon Customer,7-Jun-17,5,I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to.
Spotify,awesome!,Michael Crow,27-Dec-16,5,this literally has almost every song i have ever searched. plus offline mode is amazing!!
Spotify,Amazing,Kasey Minor,10-Nov-17,5,I love Spotify!! Very good quality and good songs!! Very easy to use!!!
Spotify,Awesome music,carl simms,10-Apr-16,5,This app is wonderfully diverse in its music content. You can create your own playlist or listen to individual songs. Typing in an artist name reveals lots of albums and hit songs.
Spotify,Amazing app!,Amazon Customer,4-Jun-17,5,This app is amazing and you don't even have to get a premium account to get access to great music!
Spotify,Better than Pandora,Jackie C,13-Jul-16,5,"I switched to Spotify from Pandora because I wanted to be able to choose the songs I wanted on my playlists while still having the option to create radio stations like on Pandora. They have a huge variety, so pretty much any song you're looking for, they'll have. The radio stations (created based on artists) tend to play a lot of the same songs over and over. I use the paid version so I don't have to listen to ads when I workout, and I'll continue to do so."
Spotify,Can't live without it!!,Anna Morrison,8-Jan-17,5,"Can't live without iit!! It has opened up my musical perspectives so much & the Discovery Weekly playlist is so awesomely selected, I fell Spotify knows me!"

Spotify,worth it,Kindle Customer,27-Dec-14,4,I love that I can choose from a wide variety of music.and don't have to be locked in on a certain style
Spotify,Love it. Goodbye pandora.,Eva Christina Gray,28-Dec-15,5,"My dad listened to spotify all the time, so I tried the free version (i have a fire tablet hd 8 edition 5) and have had no problem at all. You can download a lot of songs and listen to your own playlist, or somebody else's playlist. No more pandora for me."
Spotify,Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle,Amazon Customer,26-Jan-17,5,Wish I could hold and drag songs/playlists to order/re-order like on the PC version but for my kindle. But that's nothing to lose a star over. Still the best out there.
Spotify,Great Music App,Denise Pribil,26-Oct-17,5,"Great app, has every kind of music that you like. You can find a lot of great songs that you would not have found before. Also you can listen to old music or new music."
Spotify,Five Stars,Susan Hobson,28-Aug-17,5,Love Spotifyâù_ï¸è
Spotify,The discover playlist is your answer for new music.,Richard Huczko,11-Feb-16,5,"I don't know what to say. I'm a spotify fiend with a premium membership. I can hear anything I want and any songs that I happen to love, but the weekly discover playlist keeps me coming back because I'm incapable of finding new music on my own."
Spotify,Very good app,MashyTater,9-Apr-17,5,"This is a very good app,I've used it for about 2 years now, my only issue is how often there's an ad but that won't stop you from singing in the shower!"
Spotify,Best Music App,Yaritza Abdelnour,13-Sep-15,5,"This app has the most variety of music available that I have seen in any app and it is so efficient. The playlists you create can be played offline as long as you have a premium plan which, compared to other music apps, are very affordable. I would reccommend Spotify for everyone."
Spotify,I fux with spotify,i.wiley,15-Aug-17,5,My only choice for music listening
Spotify,Awesome app,Kindle Customer,12-Jul-17,5,This app is awesomeLalalala yay yay yay yay yay yay
Spotify,"Good service, great app, disappointing business model",Amazon Customer,8-Sep-15,4,"The app is great. Nice design and interface. It's easy to learn and a good service, but I would appreciate the same functionality between tablet and phone. I think it's a bit inconvenient that my phone/phablet doesn't have the same access to songs without shuffle, as a tablet does."
Spotify,Best music app I've ever used.,B. Mohnkern,31-Aug-15,4,"Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads.  My only complaint is that for unknown playlists (such as one I made) is hard for friends of mine to find unless I send them the playlist.  Small complaint, and I definitely love using Spotify."
Spotify,simple,Kindle Customer,5-Jun-16,5,Simple and it works.
Spotify,"First name greatest, last name ever. Middle name music app. (That make greatest music app ever)",Simoman,28-Mar-17,5,Best App for music ever
Spotify,small bug otherwise great app,Sarah,15-Oct-14,4,"There's a small issue I have a lot of times it will not allow tracks to be played or will say a track is playing, but I only hear silence. That and once it wouldn't let me share to Facebook (facebook specifically.) I haven't tried since. Great quality sound though, and I love the wide open variety. Wouldn't want an app that only has pop, rap and country :p love it"
Spotify,Almost Awsome,Sally  hale,27-Nov-14,4,I love the fact that this is free and our favorite music I shared spotify with all of my friends but here comes the negative thing tablets don't call out of state with a bid ass screen it should be music anywhere for free no internet.

Spotify,Good App,mjbjn05,2-Mar-16,4,I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it's a good application.

Spotify,Great Music App,Fan of HSS,19-Feb-16,4,"Has lots of popular songs, however I was disappointed that Taylor Swift wasn't on here. She is my favorite singer, so I wanted to hear her music. Otherwise, good music app. You can create your own public channels and playlists. I recommend"

Disappointing . I  won't be paying 10 $ a month. Maybe once and done. Where can I find a free app besides iTunes thats free???
Spotify,very pleasant,travis,14-Dec-14,4,"I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood.  Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."

Spotify,spotify,eabha,25-Dec-16,5,"I love this app so much you can get so much free music, it's really crazy. They have such much music. They don't have Taylor swift though, which kind of sucks."
Spotify,Love offline option,Frederick L. Huntington,13-May-16,5,Spotify often has new albums soon after their release. Also artist radio and topical playlists fit my folky/alternative preferences. Much of the content is available for listening offline with premium. I'm hooked.
Spotify,great app for the most part,Theresa Smith,1-Aug-15,3,I love everything about this app except for the premium. I bought premium at a great price of 99Â¢ for 3 months. But when I go to spotify when I'm in the car for example it says no internet connection and won't let me listen to music . So I pretty much bought premium for nothing.
Spotify,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,6-Sep-17,4,"I love how you can customize your list it not just a ""stations"" it's your music."
Spotify,the best music app so far,Bethany,9-Jan-16,5,"I love spotify. 20 times better than Pandora. You can rewind, fast forward songs. Make lists. Save songs, find SO MUCH NEW MUSIC, pick lists by your mood, or genre...and many many more. So glad I found this app. You will love it. Give it a try"

Spotify,While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical ...,Birdman,7-Aug-14,3,While listening to opera the music is interrupted by musical commercials for contemporary music.  Music sets a mood.  The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music.  These interruptions are truly ill conceived.  I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met.
Spotify,The Only Way To Listen To Music!,Nana #1,8-Apr-16,5,"We received Spotify as a gift. Our kids had been recommending it to us for quite a while. Finally they gave us the Premium version. We love it! Listen to your favorites anytime, anywhere!We highly recommend Spotify!"
Spotify,excellent,Melody Quintero,15-Jan-16,5,For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I didn't want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. It's worth it
Spotify,Awesome,Redwood,11-Oct-17,5,It is very easy to use.
Spotify,Spotify is amazing,Don't Buy This Game!,6-Oct-15,5,Yes you can only use shuffle play on a mobile device if you're on the free version that's why I'm always listen to the radio but if you like or don't you have to try it on the computer it's totally different.I believe Spotify completely earned five stars
Spotify,BEST APP EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!,Susan,19-Mar-16,5,I love this app so much!!!! I was so happy to know that you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then you just have to hear 1 ad that is like 30 seconds then you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. Best app ever!!!!!!!!!!

Spotify,Works great on my kindle fire!!,ChicStylishGirl,14-Apr-16,5,I use this on my Kindle fire. I love that I can see is to store my off-line music on my external SD card or on my internal storage. It's a great app and I'm very happy with it. Really enjoying my student pricing as well

Spotify,Suggestions for playlists,Virginia F,21-May-17,4,When you do suggestions for a playlist with multiple genres you focus on one genre. Try and suggest songs for all the genres on the playlist :)
Spotify,Perfect!â™¥,Savannah Danielowicz,12-Nov-15,5,Its awesome so much better than Pandora!  But what would make it even better is if you added when concerts of your favorite bands are playing it would help people so much!  And you would get less complaints about the ads!  Hope you consider my idea thanks!

Spotify,Love this app,Mary Jones,27-Feb-15,4,Love this app. Iv found every song iv looked for with only one artist and one song exception.  If I could have found those it would have been 5 stars. It's very user friendly and I love that it let's me get entire albums at one time or pick and choose individual songs. Definitely recommend this app for music lovers.
Spotify,BETTER THAN IHEARTRADIO AND PANDORA BOTH!!!!,Gerry D Pratt,3-Nov-16,5,"It's free.  Commercial ever 30 minutes, and they have every stone by EVERY artist.  Easy to navigate and create your own playlist too.  Wish I found this 2 years ago!!"

Spotify,Nice for work,Candy Bower,7-May-16,4,I like being able to pick songs or albums to listen to. Creating my own stations is very important as I listen to it while I am at work. Depending on how your day is going can change what you want to listen to.
Spotify,Great,Graciela Stanford,16-Nov-15,4,This app is pretty great let's you listen to any music you want. But it also plays songs that arn't on your Playlist but in the same genre. If you get the whole pack thing that you have to pay for monthly then they only play the songs on your playlist.
Spotify,Love it!,Ms.C,26-Mar-17,5,Excellent! Glad  to have access to all music in one place.
Spotify,"Great app, but needs one feature",pounditz,12-Feb-15,5,"Really great app, add your own specific music, listen to stations by the the artist or songs like pandora but smarter, and download music from spotify with a premium account. But one feature is that I wish you could pay for premium via amazom store, like a subscription. Other than that, its an awesome app for music."
Spotify,Great app for streaming your music...,TheStreetDoc,13-Aug-15,5,Access to pretty much any song imaginable at the drop of a hat with a $9.99 Spotify Premium membership is a great deal in my mind. This replaces all my long lost CD's and for a fraction of the price of buying songs individually. Five stars for the service and the app itself.

Spotify,Two thumbs up,Cherish Hannaman,1-Sep-15,5,"Easy to use, all the songs I want are on there and all kinds of versions. The only thing I don't like is that when I want to test out a song to see if it's the right one it doesn't let me listen to it without downloading it. But it's still a good app. Two thumbs up! :)"
Spotify,The Best,Jimini,28-Jan-15,5,Spotify is the best download site for those who want a great site for downloading their favourite music.

I would recommend this site to anyone who wants the best music download site out there.
Spotify,Amazing,Kindle Customer,30-May-17,5,I love it because you get lots of more music
Spotify,"Okay, I guess...",Critic,26-Oct-14,3,"Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can't play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."
Spotify,Very good!,Katboy,7-Nov-16,5,"I think this app is amazing. Its free, with only occasional ads, usually giving periods of ad free music. The app is also easy to use, and has many songs to enjoy."

Spotify,Best Music App!,Amazon Customer,19-Jun-16,5,"I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash (think of that what you may because I just went to emÃ¸tiÃ¸nal rÃ¸ad shÃ¸w yesterday (June 18, 2016)) so hehe.  But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic.  I'm awkward just get the app."

Spotify,#Spotify best app ever!!!,Amazon Customer,9-Jan-17,5,This is literally my favorite app on this entire tablet! It has my fave a cappella group called Pentatonix! Totally 100% worth downloading!#HorseLover!
Spotify,Love Spotify but...,William Jay,8-Nov-14,5,Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring.
Spotify,Five Stars,ANDREW BETRIX,27-Mar-17,5,excellent music

Spotify,fire phone user,Jennifer Peters,2-Sep-14,3,This app has lots of great music however I'm in a dead zone so if I'm not in my house where I have Wi-Fi I can't listen to it which means running and other outdoor activities are very quiet.  It tells me to update to premium so I can use it offline but when I search for the premium I can't find it.  How can I update to premium if it's not available?

Also playing songs not on my playlist. I liked it so much better before the new update. It would be a five if it didn't update...
Spotify,Spotify is the Way to Go,Greg T,14-Dec-15,5,"Apple is catching up to Spotify, but I'm sticking with this music service.  Great music and one way to keep the industry from imploding.  For me, Spotify seems to have slightly better transmission clarity and a more user-friendly interface."

Spotify,Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other ...,Rose Bear,14-Feb-15,5,I listen in the morning and afternoon at work. Great selection and I enjoy it better than the other like services. You can skip as often as you like and don't need to give a song a thumbs up or down. I enjoy the different selection and the updates so I'm not hearing the same songs over and over. It's worth it.

However on my Blackberry Passport and LeapFrog Epic who can only get apps from the Amazon AppStore, Amazon is denying me the ability to download the update. Very disappointed. I've already contacted Amazon Customer Service and they told me to contact Spotify, who is appearing to be clueless as to what has happened.I'd have given it 5 stars, but denying me off the update, even for something I'm paying monthly for, is just plain wrong."

Spotify,Works really well and provides and awesome service!,Art W.,29-Oct-15,5,"Greatest music app on the planet! I started off as a free user and loved Spotify even then. . . however, I have to admit that I am now a Spotify Premium user (student) and love it even more. The app works great, the Discover Weekly playlists are usually awesome and I don't regret paying for it at all. What I like about it, is that I download almost any song that I want to my devices, and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone, but if you're like like me you might get hooked and not be able to get away.*One important note: Spotify usually has clean radio edits of pretty much all songs but right now it doesn't have a general filter/ setting that you can use to filter. If you are offended by profanity or worried about objectionable content (and don't want to monitor it closely) that might pose a problem because beside looking at each individual song I don't know a workaround."
Spotify,Amazing,Rowena Ravenclaw,28-Feb-17,5,I love this app I don't even have premium and I luv it
Spotify,I can't find the premium,maeve,17-Jul-14,2,What I don't understand about this app is why I can't get the premium. It's very stressful when I'm trying to find the premium and the kindle Appstore keeps telling me it doesn't exist. Every time I want to skip a song after I ran out of skips it pops up a reminder to get the premium. But how can do that when the Appstore says it doesn't exist?
Spotify,My favorite app,Elizabeth Garcia,12-Aug-17,5,I love that I can listen to the music I like anywhere with this app
Spotify,Love it,Emma Loderick,11-Jan-17,5,I use Spotify almost everyday and love it! I would like to see a wider variety but for the most part all of the songs I love are on here.
Spotify,Love Spotify,NatashaJune,6-Oct-14,5,I am enjoying this service so much. Only a few songs I've looked for that they don't have but 9x out of 10 they've got it. One thing I wish is that there was a way to make a song offline without it having to redownload. At some point the music space maxes out and then I have to undownload it. But other than that I'm very satisfied.
Spotify,Good,Kindle Customer,10-Jul-17,3,They don't have BeyoncÃ©'s Lemonade album.

Spotify,Good way to enjoy music.,Cindy Segal,21-Dec-14,4,"Great way to listen to listen to music without having to pay any thing. I wish it had a sleep timer like Pandora. If I wasn't already paying for Pandora, I would probably pay for this and get it commercial free. But the commercials are not long or frequent. And paying gives you the option to listen offline."

Spotify,Wonderful!,jc,1-Nov-14,5,The only thing that is not the best is 30 second ads but things like Pandora do that.Other than that it's great you can make playlists and share them to everyone and follow your favorite artists and listen to their songs. I totally recommend getting it over so many other things. Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do!

But there is a reason why I can't give it four stars. You can't change the song. You need a payed membership to pick certain songs and skip them, otherwise it's just placed on shuffle. Other than that though, I love it!"
Spotify,amazing,very entertaining,19-Mar-15,5,I think this app is amazing. It was a little confusing at first but with their guide I was able to figure it out. They have a very big collection of all types of music. I really wish that I didn't have to have internet but it is still a very good app. This app very much suits the kindle.

Spotify,I love music - I love Spotify!,Kerry McCabe,10-Jan-15,5,"Spotify is awesome! From music to comedy, they have pretty much everything you could desire to listen to. You can also add your own music to the player to listen to as well. Unlike Pandora, the music is on-demand so if you want to listen to en exact song or album you can. Well worth the $9.99 a month!"
Spotify,Lots of music available for your listening pleasure,Gisella Patharkar,7-Jun-17,5,"This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay $10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to ""shop"" and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love  the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone."

Spotify,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,6-Jun-17,5,"It's perfect , like it"
Spotify,"Good for a Free App, But There Are Some Playback Issues",TowerOPower,26-May-15,4,"This is a free app, so it's hard to complain too much. I downloaded it for my Kindle Fire HD. It loads quickly and has all the features you need for Spotify on a tablet. Unfortunately, there are a few playback issues. Three main examples:1. Songs often skip or have annoying pops.2. When using the shuffle feature for an artist, the app seems to play the same few songs over and over (and mostly from the artist's most recent albums).3. The app often stops playing music when using another program on the Kindle. For example, if I am browsing the internet, the app sometimes quits halfway through a song and has to be restarted.Overall, this app has some challenges to overcome, but it gets the job done most of the time. After all, if I'm listening from my Kindle Fire, I'm not exactly in search of a premier audio listening experience."
Spotify,Amazing yet Disappointing,maymay1992,10-Oct-15,3,"I totally love Spotify, no doubt. But heck, I am having a hard time on this because I can't listen offline and even though I already updated this app, it keeps on saying that I need to upgrade to listen offline. Can you please fix it?"

Spotify,Spotify,Brent C Thomas,3-Jul-17,5,Spotify is awesome! I can play my favorite songs anytime. There are few ads and you can create your own playslists.
Spotify,Spotify,Bailey Andersen Messina Dicus,5-May-15,5,"Awesome. Just pure awesome. Any genre, any artist, any song, any mood playlist, whatever, for free. And all you have  to deal with are ads (and finding a Wi-Fi zone as well.). And if an artist releases a new album, you can listen to it almost immediately after the release."
Spotify,Horrible,Bob saget,4-Apr-17,2,"The selection of music is great, but there are unrelenting commercials that prevent you from listening to the music"
Spotify,quite possibly the best app for music,Kindle Customer,14-Mar-16,5,"quite possibly the best app for music.  I am a premium member so I get to listen to whatever I want, when I want with no adds or added songs.  Great selection and I dont think I could live without"
Spotify,Excellent,UndeadBob,31-Aug-15,5,Been a huge fan ever since Sony jumped on board. I love the &#34;artist radio&#34; as a great way to discover similar artists with great albums. I also love to see companies adopt 3rd party solutions (reminds me of the Windows XP days).
Spotify,"Holy Streming Data, Bat man!",Theo Lindsey,20-Sep-15,5,"This app is the most awesome ever! Over the years I have lost at least a thousand vinyl albums and CD's for many different reasons.

Spotify,Brilliant range of music and accessibility.,Ricardo,24-Dec-16,5,I still cannot believe how fast and extensive the range of music is and the ease with which one can produce and access playlists.
Spotify,five star app,Derek Redelman,29-Sep-15,5,I was so happy when my sister told me about this app. I like to listen to music while I work so it was nice not having to find a new song on YouTube every time a song ended. Get Spotify if you dont have pandora on your hand held device.
Spotify,Love it.,Kindle Customer,27-Mar-17,5,I love Spotify. I have just about every artist that I love.
Spotify,awsome app,paula olson,22-Jun-16,4,This app is so awesome u can listen to so much music. The only thing I don't like is how u only get 5skips and when u use all of the u have to wait one hour for 5 new skips
Spotify,Can't Live Without It,Sarah Redden,23-Oct-15,5,"Spotify is the app I use the most. It's my constant companion in the car, at home, at work. The Discover Weekly playlist has introduced me to tons of songs and artists I now love, and reminded me of others that I forgot I enjoyed."
Spotify,Would be nice to be able to cut the ads down on ...,SKID NY,28-Apr-16,4,"Would be nice to be able to cut the ads down on the unpaid version. I love the fact that unlike youtube, this thing keeps playing in the background while I do other stuff on my android."

Spotify,What?,Abby Dereberry,27-Dec-15,2,It has all these adds that say get premium blah blah blah and when I click on it it won't let me get it and also I used to be able to listen to music without wifi but now I can't and I have to get premium to do it.
Spotify,I think it a great app except when I want to listen to the ...,William C Hutcherson,2-Mar-15,4,"I think it a great app except when I want to listen to the album consecutively, it won't let me. I have to listen in the random mode. I wanted to become a premium member, but there isn't any easy way to do that. If I could have figured that out Spotify would have gotten the high five."
Spotify,It's Pretty Great!,Olivia Brock,7-Jul-16,4,"This app is really good for listening to music and the sound quality is good. I just wish they had more of Taylor Swift and other artists. Also at this point my spotify/kindle has glitches and I can't pull down the top of my screen and see the Spotify tab to skip forward and/or back. Other than that, this is a great app! However, when the trailer for â€œ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals. So I would highly recommend this app for all the music lovers. ( LIKE MEH!!! ) _Ÿ_†_Ÿ_†_Ÿ_†"
Spotify,A great app,Amazon Customer,8-Jun-17,5,"A lot better than Amazon music, more music and worth it!!!  Another way to see what your friends are listening to."

Spotify,doesn't always load next song,Havok Toshyn,30-Dec-15,3,"On my S5, this app is amazing. On my fire hd tablet, however, I often times have to manually skip to the next song. For whatever reason it doesn't always play through my entire playlist. It gets annoying. If they fixed that, I would give it a 5 star though."
Spotify,Spotify works and does what it says,Nathan Shaw,31-Jul-16,4,App works pretty nicely. Only drawback is lots of commercials before switching to premium. Premium also gives full functionality which helps me like the app more.
Spotify,Incredibly personalized,Hannah,17-Sep-15,5,Regardless of what mood I'm in there's always music for it. I can let Spotify shuffle songs for me by listening to the radio. Or if I want to hear a specific song I can search exactly for that. I can't find a single fault! I love spotify!
Spotify,Awesome,Ncovault,12-Jan-16,4,"Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can't play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it's the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc."
Spotify,Best Music App,Shannon Irene Virginia Mill Miller,12-Dec-15,4,"Spotify is great for listening to your favorite music and discovering new music. Making your own playlists is a snap, and the radio option is pretty snazzy too. I love Spotify more than any other music app I've tried."

Do I really care that much? No. My husband has the premium version and it's worth it to be able to take your playlists on the road with you. I'll probably upgrade soon."
Spotify,spotify is a must have..,Alyssa,24-Jul-15,5,Awesome when u have premium...  but it is also very cool if you don't want to spend the money to get premium. You just can't listen to it offline.  I enjoy listening to music whenever I'm bored so it can cheer me up. Definitely a 5 star. Must have. :)

Spotify,Awesome App!,Anonymous,19-Jan-16,5,"This app works perfectly well, and I love it! The music they have is great, even though they don't have Taylor Swift songs. Spotify Premium is better, but even if you don't go premium this app works awesome."

Spotify,Does the job but keeps crashing,V,7-Jul-15,3,Does the job but keeps crashing. And the audio on the app isn't loud enough compared to when I stream songs on youtube.

Spotify,Better Than Pandora!,Mocha Dee,20-Oct-14,4,Love it less commercial ads! You get to listen to a lot of music before and ad comes on. The app also let's you try your music without commercials and offline for a free trial. I'm not sure if you have to pay for that feature after the trial period. Still trying to find that out. Otherwise a fantastic app.

Why they didn't do this sooner I'll never know. It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there's nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy. It's free what more do you want?"
Spotify,"Even without premium, it's great!",inka75reviews,28-Dec-16,5,"I love Spotify!!! I don't have Premium, but it is still so useful! I really love Pentatonix, so I put a bunch of there songs on a playlist. Premium costs money and I don't have it. You can't skip on the radios a lot, but you can on your playlists. I can turn my Fire 5th generation off and it still plays. I am listening to Dark Horse by Katy Perry right now while typing this review. The only thing I don't like are the ads, but that's to be expected."
Spotify,I love it.,Victoria Banks,17-Mar-17,5,Spotify gives a lot more freedom to you than Pandora in my opinion.And the Daily Mixes are the best.

Spotify,I did enjoy the music collections once I found them,Moose Man,11-Jan-15,2,"Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me."
Spotify,GREAT AND AMAZING,Verena_ina,12-May-16,5,"GREAT!!! It's amazing and prime is so worth it. But it's shuffle is not the best buts still incredible variety of music, I totally recommend that you download this app!!!!!!"

Spotify,Update ruined it!!!,Gregory D. Arntz,9-Oct-15,2,This app started out great. I used it all the time but ever since I updated it they require you to upgrade to premium just so you can turn off shuffle mode and I think that is absolutely ridicules. Do not download this app.

Spotify,The only reason for four stars,Lloyd Cody,1-Mar-16,4,The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song.

Spotify,Glorified Pandora,kelly,23-Sep-15,3,"Used to be really great before they switched it to where only premium members get to pick songs. Now with the skip limits and the only allowing shuffle play, it might as well be just like Pandora. Only Pandora has less ads."

Spotify,SPOTIFY IS...,M.,30-Dec-16,5,The BEST music app. The only issue for me is that I am cheap and don't want to pay for prime and thus off line use.

Spotify,Something to Fix?,callmemaybe,26-Oct-15,2,"Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to."

Spotify,Spotify is spectacular!!,TTU Angel Andie,1-Jan-16,5,"I found Spotify three years ago, and this music enthusiast was hooked! After I bought my Kindle HDX two years ago, I immediately downloaded the Spotify app.I have never been disappointed. The only drawback is the amount of room needed to store any music on your device.  For example, taking into account all of the songs, albums, and playlists I have, it encompasses almost 5 gigs of my tablet to store my music. It's all relative to the amount of total space your tablet or phone has available."
Spotify,Amazing,Angela Allsbury,18-Sep-17,5,Best purchase ever!

Spotify,Best music app if you have limited cellular data on your phone,MicheleLK,4-Aug-14,5,"I thought I'd never leave Pandora, but someone made me try Spotify and I haven't looked back since.  You can do a ""radio"" feature, but even better than that is that you can download the songs that you like the most, so you aren't wasting your cell data plan.  Just download the music over Wifi and take it to go!"
Spotify,She is a big fan and thought that I would like it also,Amazon Customer,2-Dec-16,3,My sister-in-law suggested this to me.  She is a big fan and thought that I would like it also.  Have not used it yet.

Spotify,"Okay, getting better.",Chicago Slim,25-Dec-16,3,"I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order & retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it's better now than when I first bought it.And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists."
Spotify,Something went wrong needs fixing!,Segali,28-Mar-15,3,"My whole Spotify Music app got stuck at the very beginning of their own advertisement.

Please look at this before you get it.
Spotify,Works great,Anonymous,20-Oct-14,4,This app works really well and it has almost every song you can think of with some exceptions. I wish that there would have been a tutorial on how to use it.

Spotify,GREAT but...,Nolan,16-Apr-15,4,I LOVE this app to pieces but there is one problem. There's no premium on the app store like it said I even checked goggle play store! Why I want premium is because you can go offline and listen to music. I don't care about adds I want to listen music!
Spotify,Awesome app...,Kitty Girl,26-May-15,5,I love that I can create multiple playlists of music based upon tempo or theme.  It's like have access to multiple CDs.  Great app.  Just wish I could afford a premium subscription to get rid of ads.  So far I like this much more than Pandora.
Spotify,Awsome,Sherena Carter,4-Nov-17,5,LOVE this app
Spotify,Awesome,Salina M.,2-Nov-14,4,"Spotify is the most amazing music app I have ever downloaded, it lets you take your music anywhere you go if you have premium, that's why I rate it 4 stars, because for some reason it won't let me get premium on my kindle fire, once it will let me, then I shall give it a perfect 5 stars"
Spotify,BEST MUSIC APP EVER,J. Grogan,11-Jul-16,5,I love this app its really cool and my favorite song is IM A PRETTY GIRL by pewdiepie. And its a really cool way to not bored when going campingXD

Spotify,Wonderful App,R. Snow,19-Jan-15,5,Very easy to use and in my opinion better than Pandora if you have particular artists or albums you want to listen to. I use this with the Bluetooth feature on my kindle fire to listen to high quality music on my home stereo. I wish I would have downloaded this sooner.

Spotify,Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music,Alex Murillo,13-Jul-14,4,"Well designed user experience and great catalogue of music, however desperately needs Chromecast support.  Also, needs to add support for up to 5 synced devices because the cost is bordering on too high. Strongly considering the Google Play Music streaming service but for now the catelogue is not as extensive."
Spotify,amazing!,M. Lacoff,13-Jan-15,5,"This app is a godsend. I can listen to any song I think of, without having to buy it or wait for it to play on Pandora on some radio. My only concern is how they stay afloat financially, but that's not really my business. Overall, definitely deserving of all five stars!"
Spotify,amazing,Wesley May,25-Dec-15,5,"Brought the premium subscription I couldn't have been happier! I save all my music straight to my Fire Tablet and listen to it all day regardless of where I am, WiFi or no WiFi, it's available"

Spotify,great music app,Amazon Customer,31-Jul-14,5,"This is one of the best music apps on the appstore. Its awesome to be able to create your own playlist.

Spotify,What happened?,Measy,28-Sep-14,3,"Ok so this app was amazing but it updated yesterday and since then it hasn't been work at all. To get a song to play, I have to skip forward to the next song and then back to it. Even then, the track will sometimes magically become ""unavailable"". I hope they release a bug fix soon."

Spotify,best app ever,stephanie bales,27-Sep-15,5,"I think this is the best app ever because you gear to play songs any time you want. The only kick is you either need to have WiFi or get premium. When you are not allowed to play songs, just delete and download."
Spotify,Impressive set up!,Lena,9-Feb-17,4,"I don't want to pay for music, and this is an option.  It does have an annoying amount of advertisements."

Also it got kind of annoying when all of a sudden the adds started coming in at random times when my songs were on shuffle. Other than that it's a really good app, and I give it a thumbs up."

Spotify,"I liked it, and I still do. Somewhat",Melissa M.,21-Jul-16,3,"Now, when I first got the app about two years ago or so, it was a different app. You could listen to the songs you wanted and save them to listen to later, and listen to whatever, as long as you had WiFi (unless you had premium), and listen to sponsored apps every handful of songs. It was great.Now days, ads cut off the ending of songs, it crashes, freezes up, and you really need a premium account if you want to do anything. It seems as though they are more desperate for money, and I get that. The thing is, 10 dollars is something a lot of people might not be able to pay, yet they want to listen to music too.It's made me happy in the past, but lately it's just disappointing me."
Spotify,Love this app!,Tessa Meinders,30-Nov-16,5,I get to listen to 30 minutes of add free music after watching a short add. I recommend this app to everyone.

Spotify,good but can be better. Pricey after Intro deal,Zaldy32,11-Feb-15,4,One of my favorite  music on demand apps. Lots of music . I just wish the music search was more like searching for a song on YouTube. Where you can type whatever lyrics you know and it matches. Spot iffy doesn't have this search tool on par yet with you tube .
Spotify,Great Music app better than Soundcloud,BurningPhoenix,16-Jun-16,4,I love this I used to be a SoundCloud lover now I switched to Spotify and it is better than Pandora in my opinion. It would be no.1 but too much ads

I love the ability to find multiple versions of the same song from different albums, live concerts and different artists renditions. The ads are not too obnoxious on the free version, which makes this much better than Pandora IMHO."
Spotify,It was better.,Alex A.,12-Sep-15,3,"Spotify was great until you need to get premium to listen to what ever song you wanted instead of the shuffle. It was my favorite app, but I have to resort to YouTube now to listen to whatever song I want to hear."

Spotify,Good but should be cheaper for premium,Amazon Customer,25-Feb-16,4,I really like this app but I think that premium should be cheaper or free that way if someone doesn't have the money to pay nine dollars a month  then they have to pay less.

Spotify,An excellent music app! :D,Greg,24-Dec-14,5,"WOW! This is a rare thing too see. This app has every single song I like too listen to with few exceptions. Also new music comes in frequently. Its something you truely have to get to understand and apperciate how awesome it is. Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that. User for 2 years 10/10 stars ---Official_Notbatman :D (Review made on 24 December 2014)"
Spotify,"it was all right, IMHO",F. J. Goslin,29-Oct-14,3,"I really didn't like searching through songs and albums to find the music that I like (Eagles, Doobie Bros. Boston, LED Zep., and etc.) to set up a play list. If I have to go to that length of time and listen to the commercials,  I might just as well set up a playlist on my Kindle."
Spotify,Best music app ever,Anthony Creed,24-Mar-16,5,"I want to hear a song so I find it and play it. I want to listen to an album, an artist, I find them and I hit play. So simple and a seemingly endless array of music."

Spotify,Hear Any Song in a Matter of Seconds,Kim Ryan,6-Aug-14,5,"I've used a lot of music apps - Pandora, iHeart Radio, Tune in, etc. - but never one with such amazing search speed, ease of use, and nearly instantaneous playback. Old, new, even rare, obscure music --this app  has found every single one I searched for and started playing it in only a few seconds."

Spotify,Great but...,Madison Washburn,20-Apr-17,4,"This app offers you a huge selection of music for all tastes, but if you don't have the premium account you have ads. Whenever the ads come on they either get stuck and I have to press pause which means I have to get up or out of the shower and take care of it. Or the ad video gets stuck and the time keeps going and once the time runs out everything stops and the only way I've figured out to fix it is by deleting the app, downloading it again, and logging back in. This may not seem like a big deal but it frequently is happening now which is making it a huge inconvenience for me."

Spotify,There are better options,Mr. Jon P. Gill,17-Mar-15,3,"Works most of the time, but could be much better. Any time I have used Spotify since its beta, I can't help but think that it is designed to keep you from its main purpose; listening to music. Finding artists albums and songs are easy enough, but listening to the music is frequently interrupted with adverstisements (much more often than like services such as Pandora). The music also stops playing on many of my devices when in standby mode after a random amount of time for some reason. In my opinion it focuses too much on being easy and loses much of what I want from a music player in the process."

Spotify,"Disappointing functionality, terrible stock playlists/stations.",Albie,29-Aug-16,2,"Was pretty excited to finally nut up for a paid music service after using standard Pandora free since it came out almost 10 years ago.  I was attracted to Spotify for the offline playback, since I lIke listening to music while camping and traveling in the backcountry miles away from cell service.  I started downloading all my favorite music, making playlists, and using the app right away.  I was never in love with the radio, and browse functions, as they felt clunky and not very intuitive. But i was making my own playlists so that didnt bothet me too much.  All was working well until it wasn't.  First the radio and browse functions started working even more poorly and then not at all, then Spotify would freeze up, and I'd have to close the app occasionally and restary.  Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone.  It still works fairly well when its actually working, but it freezes too often. The soft buttons to navigate through the features are too close and mistakes can be made too easily for efficient ""party dj"" type playback.  The stock radio stations have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on making your own playlists, and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundreds of songs ""saved"" to my phone which may be causing the freezing, still unaccpetable. But that is only half of my gripe.  Navigation is awkward and the app is in need of remodel.  I think they employ millenials to put together playlists, I haven't found a decent one yet. I was truly excited for this app but sadly I most likely will cancel if things aren't improved."
Spotify,wonderful selection,Amazon Customer,12-Feb-16,4,"I would like to see a music queue; a function to &#34;listen next,&#34; or to add to the queue.  I otherwise like the interface of this app."

Spotify,Really Amazing,Thomas of Becket,22-Nov-14,5,"It's been said before but this service is f-in amazing.  I have five decades of music in my head and whatever I think of- is there.  Music is our shared culture, it shouldn't be locked in a vault.  It should be available for us to enjoy."
Spotify,Probably never going to get another music companion. Spotify is amazing!,V3rus,5-May-15,5,By far the best music companion you could wish for! The free version is okay but being a student getting the premium for $5 a month is totally worth it. Gives you the power to control music across devices that are on the same account via cellular connection or wifi. Downloading tracks are worth it for road trips or when you're out of the city! Lastly the music library in which you can pull from is always growing and is very solid! Oh and by the way it also syncs with your itunes library as well as shazam! So you get the best of all worlds!

Also, on the web I don't have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It wasn't really specified as to why I shouldn't have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app.  Another issue is that I can't find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it's viable through high-speed internet.  The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users."

Spotify,I Love Both the Service and the App,A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com,3-Nov-14,5,"I love music of every genre, from the Jesus Music heydays in the 1970s and 80s to classical to American blues. Spotify gives me access legally to a massive range of my favorites and beyond. I have innumerable playlists, making them specific to any event in my home, or activity. For example, I have playlists for 32-minute workouts. I don't remember why, but it made sense at the time.So to review this, readers need first to distinguish Spotify from the competition, like Pandora. Pandora has its place, but what Spotify allows me to do is choose individual songs (in general). I used to buy more music on iTunes, but no longer do. The only time I buy a CD now is when it is extremely local.As far as the app is concerned, I use it on a Kindle Fire. Basically, it is one of the few Fire apps that works just as it does on my Android phone. I use the free version for now, without the paid subscription, so I still hear commercials, and, while using it on a mobile device, do not get to hear my playlists in the order in which I intended. I'll live. I'm happy I have this.Anthony Trendlanthonytrendl.com"

Spotify,Because I love Spotify. It's essentially all I listen to when ...,ineleganthedgehog,30-Dec-14,3,"Mixed feeling about this one. Because I love Spotify. It's essentially all I listen to when I'm at the desktop so putting it on my tablet seemed a no-brainer. And when it worked it was great. The one thing that annoyed me about the app was, when you played a playlist that was small (Less than 17 songs?), it would start throwing in random songs, as though you'd created a radio station. Which, why? Why the hell would you do that? Occasionally I'll make a playlist with a single song because, well, that's how I roll, but I could not get them to play without the ""suggested"" songs popping up and I could not figure out a work-around. It was pretty disappointing. Other than that though, as far as functionality goes, it seemed fine. My problem was that after several weeks I tried to open it one day and got a message that there wasn't enough storage space on the tablet. Which was a dirty lie. The only thing I use my tablet for is listening to music and surfing porn and how much space does that take? But try as I might all I could get was an error message or a blank screen. In a fit of pique I deleted the app and then downloaded it again. And it was fine. Perfectly functional. For several days and then it did it again. I deleted, reinstalled, rocked out for a couple days and then, boom, same thing again. And after doing this a few times I just gave up and installed Pandora. Possibly the problem is me. Or my tablet, which is neither terribly expensive nor a big-name brand. Or the app could be tragically fatally flawed. I mean, who knows? Regardless though, it's still worth a try. Because when it works, Spotify beats pretty much anything else on the market."

Some songs I know are not on Spotify. Like ""Buy the Stars,"" by Marina and the Diamonds. Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough?

Spotify,Spotify is one of the best music apps to have,Amazon Customer,31-Oct-15,5,"Spotify is one of the best music apps to have. Any album, an artist you can think of is available thru Spotify!! Can't be beat!"
Spotify,Spotify is the gift of music in its entirety,RexRaiger,3-Sep-14,5,"I grew up with a turntable, reel to reel tape and AM radio, then marveled when FM and cassette tapes rocked my world with improved sound and portability.  CDs upped the ante.  MP3s, portable digital players and satellite radio further extended content and quality.  Then something wonderful happened and changed everything: enter Spotify.Spotifyâ€™s paid subscription delivers ad-free all you can eat music with every song you can think of and access to every genre old and new.  Combine that with phenomenal quality and universal streaming access via any smart device â€“ PC, smart TV, streaming media player, tablet and smartphone â€“ and musical nirvana is mine.In practice, Spotify can be quite daunting.  What genre, group, album or song would I like to listen to now or download to my device for later?  Spotify makes answering this question easier with options for matching your mood or activity with playlists supplied by Spotify experts and other users as well as searching and browsing tools that deliver clear results with helpful, relevant recommendations.The Spotify experience plays out differently across each of my typical use cases â€“ desktop PC with near-field monitor speakers, tablet with Bluetooth connection to living room home theater sound system and smartphone with Bluetooth connection to car stereo or wireless headphones â€“ but each one delivers exceptional results.Frankly, exploring Spotify on a 24 inch desktop computer display and hearing the results on studio-quality monitors pointed at each ear is thrilling.  This is where I can truly grasp even the finest musical nuances and how I can accurately judge Spotifyâ€™s streaming media as excellent.Spotify on my 8.9 inch Kindle HD adds a novel musical dimension to sitting on the living room couch or hanging in the kitchen with family and friends, enabling one and all to queue their favorites, contributing background or central focus for conversation.  Handing the Bluetooth connected tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theaterâ€™s surround sound with subwoofer speakers.  Recently, I introduced a friend with a room-sized, wall to wall audio collection to Spotify, who said this tablet solution could, should and would replace his shelves and stacks with instant musical gratification.Smartphone Spotify brings an endless mobile musical mix to the gym and in the car.  In both cases, I typically rely on a quick search for a favorite group or mood-matching playlist, then get moving.  My Bluetooth headsetâ€™s controls make it easy to pause, skip or replay tunes playing on the Spotify app without touching my phone.  On the road with my smartphone connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth, the Spotify appâ€™s big Shuffle Play button makes moving past less desired tracks effortless while maintaining the spontaneity akin to broadcast radio.While all these options for consuming music are first rate, the most important service feature remains Spotifyâ€™s monumental breadth and scope.  The collection offered by Spotify fulfills my dual desires for deep diving in my musical past as well as expanding my horizons."

I have NEVER paid for the  upgrade or Premium Service of ANY APP before until now.  I was lucky enough to get in on a 90 day free trial for Spotify over the holidays and like WOW!!  In a few days, my free trial will end and I fully intend to subscribe to the paid Premium Service, not just for me, but my whole family.  The free version needs to offer a little more freedom so people can really see how fantastic Spotify really is.  If you do a free trial, anything less than a Premium subscription is just a tease and actually depressing."

I'm NOT the one to be rating this app.  I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes.  In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded.So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow.  MUSE.  The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs.  The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies)  So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group.  hahaha.  Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues.  And sounded pretty good with earphones on.  So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

With the free version you can listen to a particular artist or genre without  having to listen to the recommended songs like on other apps.However, if you subscribe to the premium service you can listen to what you want, when you want and not what they think you will like, no commercials or ads. I am able to listen to anything past or present, I have yet to search an artist that they don't have, believe me, I have tried. If you like going to concerts, Spotify will keep you updated on upcoming concerts near you. I've tried all the rest but since I found Spotify, I'm not going anywhere."

Spotify,MUST READ IF ABOUT TO DOWNLOAD!,app,9-Sep-15,3,"If you want to get this app, there are a few important things to know:1.The last I checked, they do not have Taylor Swift songs, so I'm really sorry for all those Taylor Swift fans out there! I was also disappointed with that.2. You can't play individual songs. Ok so this is how it works, you search a song and you can add it. That song you can now out in a playlist. A playlist is just where you can categorize songs. And when you see the list of all your songs, you can't just play one. You must shuffle play. I WAS REALLY UPSET WITH THIS!! RREEAALLY UPSET!3. They don't have all songs, but they do have most.4. I JUST WISH YOU DONT HAVE TO SHUFFLE PPLLAAYY!5. There is way more to Spotify, like radio and stations and things like thatTHANKS FOR READING I HOPE YOU CAN EASILY MAKE YOUR DECISION (I hope Spotify reads this and fixes the shuffle play problem. I'm sorry Taylor Swift fans, I don't think Taylor Swift allows Spotify to use her songs, it's a money /business issue. -thank you-"

I love how they have almost every song and artist you can think of! I personally don't have premium, but I still use my Spotify at least and hour a day. You can get everything from the original, to remixes, to the live versions of a ton of songs. I have everything from 1D to  for King and Country! I love Spotify and think it is epic! Once I got my Spotify, I quit Pandora and eventually deleted the app. Spotify is amazing and I would definitely recommend getting it!!!"

Spotify,Awesome,Teresa Slaten,5-Aug-16,4,Awesome but a lot of ads
Spotify,"Spotify Rocks, and Classicals, and everything in between.",Kindle Customer,3-Nov-15,5,"Spotify has changed my life!  As a dancer and dj, I have over 100,000 titles on my hard drive, but almost all of them can be found on Spotify as well, and streamed in high definition.  They can also be played offline on my laptop so I can take my playlist to any location, whether it has wifi or not.  I can share the playlists publicly to my dancers and fellow dj's.  I can add to my Local Files the albums it does not have, as long as I have them in my collection on the given computer or network, or purchase them elsewhere.  It is user friendly and cost efficient.  The artists get paid by the use of their music, per play, which seems fair-ish, at 7/10 of a cent per play: great if you are a superstar, not so great if you are a budding artist, but, hey, I can FIND budding artists on Spotify that I never would never know about if it weren't for their similar artist and radio functions, so all is fair and ethical, as far as I can see.  Those artists that stand the test of time get paid ultimately more than those that are a flash in the pan. Hat's off to Spotify!"

Spotify,Great. Ehh. Resentment....,Rashad,6-Dec-15,4,"I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong."

Spotify,"Nice app, but could use some upgrades.",ReviewMama,10-Jan-16,4,"I subscribe to Spotify premium and I got this app for our Fire TV stick. It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works, but I don't like that I need to use a 2nd device to change the songs, etc. Also, sometimes the connection isn't stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it's ok, but I think app could use some work.I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a ""Yes"" vote on my review!"

Spotify,wonderful except for compatibility issues,Gayle Galor,19-Nov-14,4,"I first downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation and it worked perfectly. It let me create my own playlists with only my own hand-selected songs and it let me skip as often as I wanted and select whichever song I wanted with only a 30 second commercial interruption every 4 or 5 songs. When I went to install the app on my new 4th generation Kindle Fire HD, Amazon popped up with a message saying that the current version of the app is not compatible, but they have contacted the manufacturer and asked them to correct the problem. When this app works, it's absolutely awesome. For once, Amazon isn't to blame for this because it IS compatible with a lot of devices. I read a lot of complaints about this, but if people are dumb enough to give their credit card info to a company that auto charges after a free trial before they're even sure that the app works, then they shouldn't complain. Spotify gives you a 7-day free trial of their premium service with no credit card info needed. You only have to provide your credit card info when you sign up for the additional 30-day free trial, then it automatically charges you. People should know if this is compatible before they provide that info.Bottom line - it's an awesome app that needs to get its compatibility issues sorted out because it's one of the best music apps out there. There are tons of pre-made playlists, and more importantly - you don't have to listen to a whole lot of music that you don't want to like most radio apps. And though you have to be online and have occasional commercials for the free version, it's still worth it. The premium version is $9.99 a month and you can download songs so you can listen offline and have no ads. Still not a bad price considering all the songs you can get if you want to pay for it.UPDATE----- Spotify has fixed their compatibility issues with the Kindle Fire 4th generation and the app is working perfectly for me again."

Spotify,Amazing App,CJ-FRESH,11-Nov-14,5,I would happily say that this app is EXTRAORDINARY it has everything u want and need in musicPros:All the music you LOVEEvery single artist ever known (even if they aren't good)Make your own playlistsListen to whatever you wantIt awesomeKeeps u updated on the new songsCons:You need premium to listen instead of shuffle playExplicit content (for all u kids out there....what would your parents think)I recommend this app for everyone they has a kindle and you should download it NO CHARGE!!!
Spotify,The sound quality is great (not excellent,Della,14-Aug-14,4,"I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."

Spotify,Spotify Is Great!,A. Ebel,15-Sep-14,5,Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go.  I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan.  The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library.  It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space.  Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights.  I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions.

However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

Spotify,Four Stars,NE,1-Mar-16,4,"Awesome, why didn't I find this sooner."
Spotify,Things to be worked on,TruePhantom,23-Apr-16,4,"Spotify is a great app for listening to your favorite songs. Being able tomake playlists that have songs you already like gives it a slight edge over Pandora. Since both are free and use ads to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really comes down to whether you feel knowing what songs are going to play versus getting introduced to new songs you might like. While Spotify does both, it doesn't really do the latter as often, where Pandora is entirely that. Really it comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for. If you want to know what is going to play based on a playlist you created go with Spotify, but if you want more of a radio deal go Pandora. Both have things they could improve on. Now as for both apps' premium upgrades Spotify, in my opinion, has more bang for your buck. You have the ability to skip and amount of songs,peak and see what is up next, have no ads, and download songs or playlists to your device for offline listening. This means you don't have to have signal nor do you have to use so much data. In my own opinion Spotify and Pandora are great apps for the type of music provider they are. Honestly if you can't choose between them, get both! If you already do and what to go premium on one go with Spotify, because it offers more in my opinion, although it is more expensive than Pandora."

You can look up any artist, song, or album, and Spotify will probably have it. There's rarely any adds, and you can save whichever music you like to your personal library. The only downfall is that you need wifi to be able to use it, but if you get premium, you can listen to your personal music whenever, wherever. Overall, it's a great app."

Spotify,I love that amazon has apps to download,LuvMyAmazon,2-Mar-16,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download. The  apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

I can find music by mood or era, and discover gems I would have never come across by just a simple search. The feature of following other members' extensive playlists is a great way to reconnect with music that has been forgotten over the years. Spotify isn't just a steaming app. It's an experience for a musical connection that I haven't found anywhere else."

When I found music for hula hooping I was impressed. The station is wonderful. You can never listen to all the music at once. It didn't come and ask are you still listening it just pays until you stop it. I recommend it for real music lovers. I love all the gospel, praise, worship and instrumental music. Praize his Holy name. Oh did I mention it didn't have all those commercials as well Yeah."

Spotify,AWESOME,Amazon Customer,27-Dec-15,5,"There's no reason to NOT get it. All your excuses go out the window now!On Amazon, compared to Itunes or Google Play, Spotify let's you CHOOSE the song. It lets you CREATE playlists. It lets you SHARE the song...Spotify has done an excellent job. Although Amazon seems to suck for not having the top app and games like Clash of Clans, everyone can find a way to do that. But exclusively to Amazon, Spotify gave its users the abilities that no other app store is capable of.All the negative reviews are lies. It's probably something the user did to their device over time(you know what I'm talking about).I totally recommend this app. Free music for life! Not very many ads, either, which is nice.Enjoy!"

Spotify,"Pick your music service wisely, then commit.",iNetSpy,1-Mar-15,5,"I love spotify...  I have the family prescription (Subscription... music soothes the savage beasties!)...  My children and I share music lists as well as my friend...  the magic to choosing a music service is commitment... Pick one and stick with it... choose a model that suits you. The pay version allows you to skip through as many songs as needed to get where you want, the free version after you skip a few it makes you listen to a full song. There is cost associated to the music for the spotify people, so I get that.  If it could read my mind, and spur my memory I would give it 6 stars..."

Spotify,this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ...,Michael Henry,23-Oct-14,5,"Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"

Spotify,Best music app ever.,mightydragoninc,25-Sep-14,5,"Spotify is amazing. I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

I wish they had access to all musicians and all songs, but their lists have come a long way since the first time I used the service a few years ago. The only thing missing is the ability to easily move a song from one of my playlists to another. Adding a ""Move to"" option in the drop down menu of each song would be a big plus. Also, I don't mind watching an ad every 30 minutes to have this service for free. :)"

Love it when l (and you) win as we do with this app. I wish most other ""basics"" were just like Spotify!

Spotify,"You need Premium, and better organisation would be great",Gregorio,2-Feb-15,3,"Fantastic IF you have the money to pay for premium , otherwise the ads are very annoying . I decided to go for it, as I don't have a very big music collection . It has completely changed my relationship to the music world, although I'm worried that I'm no longer listening to radio at all . They have practically everything I ever look for , and with premium you get excellent quality and no ads . HOWEVER I do think they could do a better job with the Kindle interface , giving you more options for how to organise your library , for example. Mine is getting quickly out of control!"

Spotify,Great source fro music.,Richard Flannigan,26-Dec-14,5,"Very good source of music. Has an almost unlimited collection to choose from. You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free.  I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available."

Spotify,good app,stevace96,27-Aug-14,4,"This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I don't pay for it there's ads but when I'm listening to death metal and deathcore, I don't want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

Spotify,great music app,Michael Bagby,21-Feb-15,5,"Works great, few crashes and most of my favorite artists"
Spotify,People don't understand this amazing app.,Onyx,15-Dec-14,5,"This app is simply amazing. It's musical heaven. Almost any song or artist you can think of, right at your fingertips. A lot of people use it similarly to Pandora; they put it on a ""station"" or ""mix"" and that feature is decent. The algorithms aren't great honestly. It works best if you use it similarly to iTunes. Finding the songs, artists, or albums you like and putting them into playlists. You can have as many different playlists as you want. And for people that don't want to pay for premium service, you don't have to. You get all the aforementioned features with the free version. The premium version is far too expensive, and the only benefits I'm aware of are higher quality audio, offline capabilities, and unlimited skips. But with an app so spectacular, you don't need to pay $9.99 monthly for such petty benefits. Also, people that complain about having to create an account through Facebook or email, they don't email you constantly or post all over your Facebook. You can set your Facebook to disallow posts from spotify, and as far as email, I've had my account for 5 months and I don't think they have ever emailed me. Bottom line: this is a must-download for music lovers! Hope my review was helpful. :)"

You choose, skip, or listen to a song when you want to. Unless you pay a whopping $10 monthly ($520 a year!), all you can do is shuffle play one genre. That's it. So dumb."
Spotify,Needs to update it's music,The Blockheadz,29-Mar-17,4,"I'm listening to Spotify as I write this, and as a whole it's a good app, even with the new update. There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. Don't take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I don't appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it's a good music app."

Spotify,its ok,Luke,12-Mar-16,3,"I really thought it would be good at first because all my friends that had it said it was great. I ended up downloading a few songs and making a playlist, and then I went through a few &#34;top 50&#34; stations and added some more songs.  Then its putting in songs on my library that I didn't add, saying recommended song. I want to listen to the songs I added, not some songs that suck that have nothing to do with the type of music I listen to. I just wish it was set up better also. Its really hard to find anything on there, and it gets really frustrating. I also hate that it shuts down right when I open it up. I just hope they fix the bugs soon."

I get to listen to a hundred times more songs, I make my own playlists, and the best part.. ITS FREE (unless you upgrade to the premium) Honestly, I am thinking about upgrading to premium myself, bc it just has a ton of cool qualities.. For one, I think that downloading the playlists of songs of your choice, and being able to listen to it WITHOUT WiFi, is THE BEST THING EVER!!!It's just THT it's on premium.. :/ but the free version is practically amazing in every way except that ONE thing....********GeT tHiS aPp RiGhT nOw!Â¡!Â¡!Â¡!Â¡!"

I love the ability to create different playlists. I also love the radio feature (you can create a custom radio station around almost any artist or song) and the ability to customize your radio by giving songs a thumbs up or down.We also have Bluetooth support in our car radio and often use it to sync our phones and listen to Spotify while riding/driving. The ads can be a little annoying at times, but I understand they have to make money somehow. You usually hear an ad every 3-4 songs."

Spotify,The SPOTIFY Music program helps old man make sense of it all!,GREENSIDEUP,29-Jul-14,5,"Spotify is a treasured addition to my computer audio program. I do not yet understand computers well and Spotify regardless, brings mevery good music. Spotify also has shown me how to better understand types of grouping I wouldn't have thought of! I very much appreciate the Premiums option of increased digital audio quality and ability to easily interface with useful software currently, I can and often do listen to Spotify music using Jriver mc 19 either, via headphone or preamplifier, There are many such Software options available as trial for you to learn more about music and computer audio. These points are a very basic starting group for Spotify. If you are as new to computer audio as Iam, enjoy and slowdown. Lee McDonald a.k.a.GREENSIDEUP"

Spotify,It's all about the Ads,Rosie!,30-May-15,3,"You can get pretty much any type of music and make a great playlist, but I can't seem to get away from commercials!  Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong, but if I play my downloaded songs, even they have commercials every 3 songs. (I suppose I could pay to upgrade and maybe I'd lose the ads, but I'm not willing to do that, as I don't listen to music constantly - or enough to pay a subscription price to go without ads.  I'd rather buy a CD if that's the case).  I don't like the  Playlist Radio, because it plays songs that are nothing like the playlist.  It's irritating.  The info says that Spotify gets to know what you like, but I have zero Abba songs (and nothing like that on my playlists), but yet what songs do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist?  Some idiocy by Abba, of course.  I suppose I was too optimistic in hoping that Spotify was like using your MP3 or iPod.  I guess they have to make money somehow.  Still, I do enjoy being able to play (somewhat without interruption) a grouping of songs I have chosen."

Spotify,Five Stars,corey,23-Feb-15,5,Best smartphone music app in my opinion
Spotify,"Good, but I'm not paying.",Julia Ziobro,23-Nov-14,2,"I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, (750+ song on several playlists that I use a lot) but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app."

I've looked for an app that allows me to play my own playlist of songs and hand pick songs I want to listen to whenever, this is that app. If you're like me and don't wanna listen to playlists based off one musician you like, Spotify is the app for you. Create your own playlist, listen to whatever you want whenever you want. If you do like listening to playlists, Spotify has that as well. If I could give it more than five stars, I would, but for now, 5 STARS! Keep up the awesomeness Spotify!"

Spotify,I Thought I could trust You,Mika,10-Oct-15,2,"I've been using spotify for a couple years, for free. Basically as soon as it was out I was using it. Just recently I was trying to pick a song to listen to( I don't listen to music often) only to be met with no song playing. I kept clicking the same song and noticed that every time I click a song the shuffle button twitches a little bit. So I then Clicked the shuffle button and voila it worked..? Not the song I wanted. It refuses To play songs I click on, it says &#34;only with spotify premium can you do this&#34;..... I've never had a problem with this and was always able to listen to any song I want when I click it. I'm really upset :( I thought spotify was one of the Best apps out there but now I feel frustrated, and something I trusted to go to, to listen, to relax, to have fun with is now going to Have to cost money..? ..well I'm not paying, your just going to have to accept my dissappointment as payment. :("

Now let's list the pros and cons,Pros: lots of wonderful music, I use it 24/7, and best of all I got a glitch that lets me do premium ! I didn't even pay for it! I do still have adds though but that's not that bad.Cons: 1. The premium cost ten dollars a month! I'm nine and I know that's expensive!2.I know this isn't Spotify fault but Taylor Swift took her music off of Spotify and I'm one of her fans! Thank you for reading!"

Spotify,Not Worth It,Nerdy101,11-Sep-15,2,"I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

Spotify,Okay,Caity C.,9-Oct-15,3,"The app is a great app,  my problem is how they have made this upgrade to purchase the premium package just to listen music.  It hasn't been like this,  and it was perfect before they made all of these exasperating  changes.  I do not like the fact that I cannot listen to the song I want to listen to,  I hate this shuffle play because it  will take albums and songs from other albums that I do not want to hear and put with the album,  and it gets on my nerves.  When I want to listen to &#34;Freak&#34; or &#34;Honeymoon&#34;  by Lana Del Rey,  I have to hear other songs of her with remixes  that ruin her beautiful songs.  It annoys me very much. I hope spotify gets my complaint  and decides to make a change. When I want to upgrade,  it doesn't me  me.  Soo,  Spotify doesn't want me to be happy.  Most of the Music  apps are on Kit Kat  4.1 (Android)  and iOS 7-9 (Apple)  and I have a Kindle."
Spotify,great app,Krista Staigle,7-Mar-17,5,I love Spotify.  I feel like I have got back in touch with music.  I have found artists that I don't think I would have ever discovered because of Spotify.  I will you could filter the explicit songs out though.

Spotify,3 stars,3 stars,13-Aug-14,3,So I made a spotify account and it was really great for a few minutes then I accidentally pressed the prime button and now I have a bill I can't pay for . I decided to shut down my account I go to the settings and there is nothing to shut your account down . So I went to Google and apparently you need to contact spotify so that they can shut down your account . I honestly see no sense in that but I email them anyway . So I go back to spotify and it says that my 7-day free trial starts now and after that I have to pay for spotify and I start freaking out. The spotify website and the Appstore says spotify is completely free unless you upgrade so I find this false advertisement. I email spotify again asking to please shut down my account by tomorrow so hopefully they will do that because my parents would kill me . Please do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through what I just went through .Best wishes

Spotify,live. love. spotify.,Georgia Wiedeman,22-Jan-15,5,Favorite music app by far.
Spotify,spotify is the best,E. G.,18-Sep-15,5,"With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover (or rediscover) all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can't really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it's not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

Spotify,Clean/Radio Edited Versions Not Available,Felicia Rodgers,11-May-15,2,"I used the app to download music for my daughter's 14th birthday party. I was disappointed because there was not a lot of hip-hop songs that did not have the explicit tag next to it. There was not a clean version or radio edited version for these songs. I was very shocked with the songs I did download whom did not display an explicit tag, but once played there were curse words throughout the song. I was embarrassed & disappointed with using Spotify for the party."

It`s an incredible app, especially if you have a premium account. There`s an immense number of selections to pick from; pop, latino, rock, country and so on. Another thing you can do if your a premium user is skip songs an infinite number of times, and pick the song your heart desires to hear.There's a number of things you can do. If you're a music lover I totally recommend this app to you. Even if you're not a premium user you'll automatically fall in love with this app, you'll be blinded by your love for music. Likewise, you'll be attached to it.The only difference of not being a premium user is not having the freedom to skip songs, and make your own selection of music. Otherwise it's beyond phenomenal."

On kindle it lets you pick any track. but listening on my android phones sucks. Because you can't pick any tracks . you can just pick songs ,  but the downside it plays a random track and also plays songs that aren't on your playlist. But on kindle you don't have that problem. I give it 4.9 stars out of 5 for listening on kindle. And 2/5 stars on android phone. I don't know how it work on apple. But on kindle I love it."

Spotify,Great music app,Amazon Customer,11-Mar-16,5,"Great music app. I've had premium for years. One thing I don't like is that sometimes when you have a song downloaded, it will change to a different version. ie:I've had ""Walk the Line"" by Johnny Cash downloaded on a playlist for a long time, then one time when i was listening to that playlist and it played that song, it was a live version, rather than the one i had initially downloaded. This has happened a few times with other songs. They would switch to covers, instrumentals, or live versions. Other than that, I love everything about this app."

Spotify,This is genius!,Anastasiya Markina,22-Jul-15,5,"Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

Spotify,The best free music app for Kindle,Gary Hollins,5-Dec-14,5,"I've tried a number of apps for music on Kindle, but in my opinion, none of them can touch Spotify. Your only inconvenience is an occasional commercial. Not bad for the trade off of being able to listen to just about any album you want. If you want the flexibility of Google Music without the $10  a month charge, check out Spotify."

Spotify,Best Music App Out There For Streams!,Missy K.,8-Jun-16,5,"Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music,  you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the  use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?I think so!"

Hmm....Also, not thrilled I can't listen to the song my husband put on there, ""Chicken Surprise"" by Brad Price, unless I upgraded to premium?!?! Quite a scam there I am was thinking...Hmmmm....But, went with the 7 days free trial and they said no charge after, it will just revert to the original afterwards unless you're with Sprint, so we'll see...."

I just can't understand how they expect someone to pay for this service when it has so many malfunctions, for me anyway.  For example I have to log in and out so it doesn't freeze up, and I have to turn WIFI on and off so it doesn't freeze up.  This is on Multiple computers so it's not just me.  Why would I pay for that especially 10 a month.I could get Amazon prime with music/TV/movies/STORAGE/shipping for 99 a year or I could get a ""spotty"" service like Spotify for 120 a year, you be the judge."

Spotify,DAMN SON,madelinethecake@gmail,9-Dec-15,5,"My bejeezes, this is awesome! I never listened to music beyond my single Coldplay album until this. Now I listen to a variation of music. What I love too, is it helps you find music you like, and it has most every song you can think of. It also has a bunch of different music indie, dubstep, metal, rock, rap, emo, pop, Mozart, alternative (my favorite), and more! In a nutshell, if you like music but don't want to spend your money on discs and other things like that, you'll love this. Best thing is it's free! All you need is an internet.connection."
Spotify,Spotify is the only way to listen to music,Chanelie O,18-Feb-16,5,"I love Spotify! It is the gateway to all things music. You are able to listen to all you favorites, make playlists, and brows music you would have never found without Spotify. I like to use the menu on a song to start a radio station around that song, then use the thumbs up or thumbs down to personalize the sounds I like. I love being able to download certain songs/playlist/ albums in order to use the offline mode that doesn't take any data from my limited plan. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants all your music in one place."

Spotify,AMAZING...but,Katnipbylaw,19-Oct-14,5,"Okay, I love this app. With all of my heart and soul, but there is some things that could be different. For example, when I'm trying to add a mass amount of songs to a playlist, it's very time consuming. Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once, and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add, is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together, and not just in the playlistsThanks"

With spotify you can create playlists of songs YOU want to hear! And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app.

Â· The music you listen to can stay private if you want or not if you want to share your picks with  the Spotify worldCon's: I haven't  found any! But I will try to keep you informed if I find any.

Spotify,It was GREEEAT ...before the update ):,Vanessa,9-Sep-15,3,"It was perfect .... before the update.Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. (Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement) Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.After (now): You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can't put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.The update was just today. (9/9/15) I feel so upset.*The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify isn't very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.I'm so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can't afford premium. It's not worth it. ):"
Spotify,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,1-Oct-14,5,Great
Spotify,Meh,Kittycat cp,22-Nov-16,4,"Some covers the artists, like nightcore, are not on there and some of the songs are not available unless you pay for premium. Lots of ads, but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They don't have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available, there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it won't work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also doesn't have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall, it is only great if you spend money to buy premium, but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi."

Spotify,Why havent u subscribed to Premium yet! Go do it! _Ÿ˜_,Korey Cleveland,25-Dec-16,5,"Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

Spotify,"So far, no sale",J. Stoner,14-Jul-15,2,"I have not had a very good experience so far, though I do like the theoretical convenience of music at your fingertips. I did not find the interface intuitive or easy to use:  Like most things on the Internet, it is easy once you know how to do it.  I found that it was playing random things not even closely related to what I was selecting.  I am certainly not ready to sign up for the paid subscription yet."

Spotify,Options button doesn't work,Kindle Customer,11-Mar-16,3,"I like the app, but the three dot option button is way to close to the playlist scrollbar. So when I want to remove a song from a playlist, the app thinks I'm trying to scroll to a different place in the list. Please fix this Spotify!!!Other than that the app  is ok. I do strongly recommend that there should always be clean versions of all content instead of just some. on iTunes, the user can pick to see Clean or Explicit versions of songs. They should have this on Spotify too. Or maybe they could just have a clean versions alongside the explicit version.Also there should be an alarm clock feature. If there already us it should be easier to find. If there is not, please add it!Thanks Spotify!"

I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands  I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

Spotify,Best music app!,Amazon Customer,28-Nov-15,5,"I personally am not able to buy many songs, and when I do I get bored of them within a week. This app completely revolutionized listening to music for me. I can follow playlists of certain music groups to expand my library, save songs that I love, and follow artists to get notifications about new releases. One of the newer features, looking for upcoming concerts, is one of my favorites. I used to be so out of touch with who is coming where, and now I have easy access! Definitely recommend this app."

Btw... if and when u do get the app, it might ask if u want to start a free 7 day trial to listen to songs anywhere, anytime... this trial is truly free and does goes through all 7 days. U DO need Wi-Fi for the app to work.. but when u are connected it works perfectly. I'd give this app 100 (or more) if possible anyways...all in all.... this app is amazing for anything. That's why I give this 5 stars."
Spotify,angel.goins_Ÿ‘…_Ÿ‘…,Angela Goins,22-Mar-16,3,I think they could do better.They should give us a month a free music before we decide._Ÿ˜•Why get something without nowing if it is worth it.It say it takes no internet and WiFi but they lied unless you pay for it.I like the songs on Spotify.They are a good website.I will not lie about that.And we should not have to sign up and you should not have to be a sertine age.That is just meen to like kids._Ÿ˜«Why

Spotify,I miss Napster.,Amazon Customer,12-Jun-17,2,"Terrible user interface.  I try to play a song on my phone, but it plays on my Alexa upstairs (apparently it plays on whatever device you last played it on). Want to clear your song queue? No can do. Have to set up a playlist with only one song, and then play that.  I only switched to spotify because I got a deal with the New York Times, but, boy, do I miss Napster."

Although I enjoy both music sources I had an unlimited ""selection change / skip"" that Pandora Limits.  Enjoyed the ability to select Singles from albums.  Worth the Membership. Keep your Pandora for hands free listening, Try Spotify to share Music files, or creating Videos."
Spotify,wonderful music by spotify,Cassandra j,10-Mar-17,5,I have enjoyed listening to Spotfiy music. I listen to it day and night. Everyone should listen and sing along.
Spotify,Five Stars,gary schmieding,4-Jul-14,5,Great
Spotify,"Great depending on genre, not for me",Amazon Customer,26-Jan-16,4,"Spotify if you're familiar with &#34;Americas top 40 hits&#34; u can keep up easily with pop songs, it's perfect for that. Also great for relaxed order of songs and if you're ok with limits to skips.I myself have grown tired of pop songs and needed more remixes and smaller songs that never find their way to the top 40.In summary, Compared to apps like rdio and Pandora it's a big one up for pop songs, but if you're after smaller artists sound cloud is the way to go."
Spotify,Internal error,LGjr,12-Aug-17,2,The app would not work on my Samsung S6 edge +.It loaded with no problem but when I tried to start it it gave me an internal error and wouldn't run. I would like to use it but can't.
Spotify,New Update,Kindle Customer,10-Sep-15,2,"This app was probably the best music app until their new update. Before I had probably around one thousand songs and could listen to any of them in whatever order I wanted to, but because of the update you can't take shuffle, play more than one song at a time, or skip songs without buying premium. This is incredibly inconvenient, and there are some songs I simply can't play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle, so it chooses a random song (usually not the one I want) and stays on the song until I get frustrated and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it is a good app; it's just a crappy update."
Spotify,AMAZING but.....,GetDisAppDoe,30-Nov-15,4,"Well, my friend had this app for a little while on her IPhone, and she LOVED it. Sometimes she used it without wifi, and it ate up all of her data. I have a kindle, and it's either me or it makes everything else.... slow. I'm worried it'll use up my data too. Besides that, it's pretty great. So...... overall, I recommend it for extreme music lovers who only want THEIR music played. The ability to create your own playlist (for free) with any music is my kind of heaven. Thank you Spotify!"
Spotify,beautiful,fortefied19,7-Aug-14,5,It works really well when u have  a book and u like music and like me I like all the music that I listen too
Spotify,Amazing app but please fix,Isxmmerlove,1-Apr-17,3,Its an amazing music app but its new upgrade has made it hard for my to even add songs to my playlists! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but nothing helped! Please bring this to your attention and fix this huge bug
Spotify,its okay,Melina medina,20-Dec-15,3,I said I s okay because at first when I got I was so happy because now I could listen to music which is my favorite thing to do so I downloaded it to my iPhone but when I clicked a song it would play another song and I found that very anoyoing and once I was going to show one of my friends a song but it played another very inappropriate song and I tryed to quickly turn it of however when I use spotifiy on my iPad it always plays the  song that I want to hear it always plays that song but then there's an add for the premium and it would all of a sudden glitch now I don't know if its my only my iPhone or its spotifiy but it is so frickin annoying
Spotify,great for lazy Sunday's and parties alike.,Kindle Customer,25-Jun-16,4,"Putting aside the whole ethical debate over artist's royalties+spotify, this app is great. Easy to use and everything comes in crystal clear; it turns my kindle into a jukebox at parties and get-togethers. It even has a great selection of some of the more obscure songs and albums that are next-to-impossible to get physical copies of. Again, judging the app, not the ""musician vs spotify"" debate. That said, definitely recommended!"
Spotify,"Get Premium, its worth it......for some",kd320,20-Aug-16,5,"Spotify has replaced my iTunes.Now, some people may think that paying monthly for a music service is pointless, however, there are benefits to this service.Not only do you get the benefits of skipping as many songs as you want, you are able to control all the music as if it were your ipod/mp3 player. The ability to search for a song you just heard on the radio and add it to your song library at that very moment is awesome. If you keep up with new music and have an extensive love for music this will be worth it.If you're already purchasing and download more than 10+ songs a month you'll save money with this service."
Spotify,Love it!,Dana,4-Jun-16,5,"I honestly love this application so much. In my opinion, it's the best one out there. Although there are a few artists and songs that I can't find on this platform, on the whole it's easy to create playlists, follow your favorite artists, and stream music. Amazing for any music lover."
Spotify,"Decent, but not perfect.",Janet in ND,14-Sep-15,3,"I really like the idea, and I have a wonderful playlist of songs I like, but there is so much repetition and so many of my songs never get played. A little frustrating."
Spotify,Perfect song app,Monique Ogden,5-Aug-16,5,"You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it's all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it's more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
Spotify,Great for Phone without an FM Tuner!,martialartist,22-Jul-16,5,"Spotify is easy to use and works great when you do not have an FM tuner chip in your phone. I have the Samsung Galaxy S4 and of course I would own the one without the FM tuner chip so radio apps will not work  I like this because I can play an artist, genre or a decade!"
Spotify,spandora,annisboys,14-Sep-15,2,"Will not let you choose what song you want to play. For a little while it will let you get addicted to it, but after that it takes those privileges away. It makes you put it on shuffle and makes you wait for the song you want to come on. Spotify will not even let you listen to just that album, it will insert &#34;suggested&#34; songs every other song. Unless you pay 10.00 a month, Spotify is not much better than Pandora. Spotify will also sometimes get stuck on an add and you will have to shut down your device to restart Spotify and continue to play music. In summary it is just as worth it to get the free version of Pandora as the free version of Spotify."
Spotify,Best Music Streaming Service!,Chris Seljestad,24-Jul-15,5,"Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums (heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to!) from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you're able to listen to your music - commercial free."
Spotify,Absolutely love this app,AAAries,12-Nov-16,5,I've used a lot of music apps over the years but I've never found one as great as Spotify and I loved the app so much I even upgraded to the Student Premium which is even better. And for $4.99 a month you can't beat the price or the quality.
Spotify,awesome,Said Abdullah,2-Oct-16,5,Best music app I have ever gotten better than I heart radio
Spotify,Take off the Restrictions on Skips,Amazon Customer,31-Oct-15,2,"I used to love Spotify so much. It was basically the best and probably one of the most used music app. Lately I noticed that there have been a lot of updates of the app. Now who wouldn't love New updates to one of their favorite app?Now I can't skip songs more than 5 times in a row, if I want to I have to upgrade to premium. I guess a lot of people aren't upgrading to premium, so now they are making less and less features of the app available for free. Now I don't mind listening to ads, and trust me they do play along of ads back to back after listening to about 5-6 songs."
Spotify,Best app,very happy,5-Oct-17,5,Great hit on songs
Spotify,5 star selection,A. Rizzo,9-Dec-16,5,I can always find music I enjoy! Thanks!
Spotify,Great Choice of Music,Vickie Washington,29-Oct-16,4,"gives new music, albums, and singles. Love it. Hate the Mobile version though that's the only thing."
Spotify,No Better Music App!!!,Kristine Johnson,21-May-16,5,"I have been looking for a updated music app which wan't glitchy or not official. (So far) there is no better application to listen to music on. I highly recommend Spotify. It is MUCH better than other musical apps because it has all the music you could ever want. Including letting you make endless amounts of playlists (which I personally LOVE). If you are looking for a good app to play music on, then download this application."
Spotify,Stream vs Storage.,John Harp,14-Sep-16,5,I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them.
Spotify,Could not upload audio CD data,Alan Samuels,18-Jul-16,2,"We were motivated to update our online library when we got our Echo, because songs from our library are available on request with the device.  Unfortunately, it appears that there is no way to upload data from an audio CD (from our physical home library).  It may be that there is a way to do this, but we were unable to figure out how to do so.  In iTunes, it is simply a matter of inserting an audio CD while the application is running.  In addition, there is evidently a 250 song limit on the number of songs you can upload into the Spotify cloud database, unless you are willing to pay ten bucks a month to upgrade the service."
Spotify,okay but it could be better,Sarah Neil,11-May-16,4,"It is actually very useful for listening to music and podcasts. The thing is, although it has many songs you might not always find the song you're looking for. Yet, the format is very neat, organized, and easy to use. But, once again, there is a little problem that I have experienced. Every once and awhile, I will be listening to music, with my volume turned up and my headphones on, but there won't be any sound. It will say that the song is playing, but you can't here it. This has caused me to have to delete and redownload the app many times. Nevertheless, this is a very good app, and hopefully you won't have any glitches."
Spotify,soifily,Love bird,3-Apr-16,5,Bc it's the best in the world you can play music off line it's awesome
Spotify,Let There Be Rock!,JerryP2375,7-Mar-16,5,"Was a Rhapsody customer for years but the playback experience would only get worse & worse until the point of being unbearable when it wouldn't even playback my downloaded songs so I looked for a replacement & came across Spotify when introduced through Sprint and have never looked back. Far superior product, zero playback issues & they had AC/DC songs which Rhapsody did not. How do you not have one of the greatest rock bands of all time??"
Spotify,Get it. Srsly,Gil Franklin,17-Feb-16,5,"Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."

Spotify,Sticking With Pandora,twizzler06,5-Dec-15,2,"My 7-day free trial ended. Once your trial ends, Spotify stinks. When you go to your playlists or radio stations they start playing random stuff! For example: I was on Ariana Grande radio and they started playing Timbaland and Nelly Furtado! You should stick with Pandora."
Spotify,Change it back!!!,Kindle Customer,30-Nov-15,4,"I started out with this app a few months ago. It was the best one I had so far. Soon after I got it though, they updated it to where only &#34;premium subscribers&#34; could listen to any song they want without having to shuffle a playlist. I miss that version and want more for us free subscribers! I get you have to make money a somwhere, but come on! Don't tease us for a bit, then take it away. Other than that, a pretty decent app."
Spotify,It would have been wayyyyy better,Tyeve28,16-Aug-16,3,"Ugh there ok, I got premium for free for three months, but after a couple off weeks I would play about three songs in a row, and the song stops playing and I would constantly have to press play. I asked a friend of mine if he had experienced that problem and he had too. I know it's not my connection because of other music apps I play. Get that fixed and then I'll think about purchasing Premium."
Spotify,Great app!!,Amazon Customer,31-Mar-17,5,Perfect! So easy to personalize and navigate.
Spotify,log-in problems,Reviewer,5-Nov-15,2,"Many times I try logging in and out tells me something like ""this email address is already linked to a Spotify account"". Right! Because it's my account,  and I'm logging in, I'm not trying to set up a new account. Otherwise the app works as it should."
Spotify,Not allowing me to pay for premium,Amanda,22-Feb-15,2,"I would appreciate Spotify Music more if it allowed me to use by Visa Debit card to pay for premium monthly. Can you imagine that I am willing to make a monthly payment for this service and just because I'm in the Caribbean I am restricted, and then it seems that when they noticed that I am not from any of the approved regions, I assume they figured that out after i entered my card info, i got locked out of my account all together, stupse. So I am annoyed. When they get their act together i most likely would give a higher rating....Smh, to think people bout the place pirating and I am willing to pay and here strugglin, stupse."

Seriously my card was stolen & I don't know the last 4 numbers of the card because I don't know which one was stolen. How do I do that if all my cards were stolen? Does this make sense to you? It doesn't make any sense to me? Explain sensai"

Spotify,I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!!,Kelly Crunkleton,8-Nov-16,5,This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!
Spotify,Music Store in your hand!,Tabithia Holman,20-May-17,5,"It has a great selection of music. When paired with Pandora, this app is a great way to discover new artists or music. Some may complain about having to pay for more freedom in playing music. While this is a downside, one can always purchase the soundtrack from Amazon, Google or in a physical store. Or dig deep and apply for premium. _Ÿ˜è"
Spotify,Better than radio,Amazon Customer,1-Apr-17,5,I love Spotify.  I can create my own playlists depending on my mood or what I'm doing.  The ads are short and dfo not take away from the app.  So much better than radio.

Spotify,Everything is great..... It's just the ads,pretty girl rock,18-Apr-17,5,"The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The adsI just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky)The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)-That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic"
Spotify,Uh...,Wiseallek,19-Oct-15,3,"This app was great, we all know it.But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"
Spotify,is the best option. Finally,Charles Anthony,2-Dec-16,5,"Having spent hours utilizing all the streaming music apps, websites, share site...ect - Spotify, is the best option. Finally, someone has it right. Premium option opens doors for work, play, gym and a plethora of other options. Especially, when you can download your playlists and use it offline in those dungeonesqe areas of concrete and steel. Get it. - Cheers, B"
Spotify,omg,alzy1234,12-Jun-16,5,Best app ever I love it u can listen to the music easily and quickly and Iove how u can make ur own play list but I wish it was for free for u to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but I loveee itt !!!!
Spotify,Kristina,Kristina,8-Dec-16,5,Love it...can listen to my music anywhere and everywhere..whether its brand new or from the 90s..!!!!
Spotify,You have to become a Premium Member...It worth it if you really love music.,redex25,7-Jan-17,5,"I am a premium member and love this app. I have several playlist and music is my life so I am always streaming my music and listening to it. I like a lot of Genres of music and this app is perfect for me, it fits my needs. I like that you can just listen to the artist unlike there competitor Pandora which only plays artist similar to the one you picked, Also I like the Offline mode when you are a Premium member, where you can download a song or album and listen to it at anytime even if you have no internet connection like on an airplane in airplane mode."
Spotify,Spot On,crew chief 21,30-Aug-16,5,"I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections.  Very easy to use.  I am 63 years young and still rock in.  Which we had this in my school years, beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
Spotify,Best that I have tried so far...loving Spotify!,Magen Vaughn,5-Mar-17,5,Move over Pandora and iHeart....I have found Spotify and there is no turning back.
Spotify,Amazing,Amanda,16-Feb-17,5,Amazing a lot better than Pandora
Spotify,Well Worth the Price,Kindle Customer,22-Nov-16,5,I  love using Spotify. I play the worship music playlist to help encourage me throughout the day and to edify my faith.  I also liked to play it during the lab courses I taught to make the classes go smoothly and quickly.  Spotify has a huge selection of all genres of music. It is worth the monthly fee to have this selection of music at my fingertips.
Spotify,Best music app and program ever,StarLightning,26-Sep-16,5,This app is awesome! I have been looking for a app that plays songs while I play games etc. Thank you so much!
Spotify,Sweet Little Music App,Dawn Ritts,29-Apr-17,5,Great stations. Great variety! LOVE this app!
Spotify,Try something else,Serry,9-Jan-15,2,"Desktop Spotify is great: nearly every song ever at your fingertips. Mobile Spotify is a different story. 90% of the time, I use Spotify when I'm out and can't access my computer, and the shuffle play function sets my teeth on edge. It's less shuffle and more like radio, since it throws in the occasional recommended artist here and there. The idea of going ad-free, offline functionality, and unlimited skips is plenty of incentive to buy the premium version, but the shuffle feature less makes me want to go premium and more makes me want to delete the app and possibly punch something."
Spotify,wow,fun game so addicted to it.,23-Jul-15,5,OMG I love this app now I can actully listen to music while turning my tab off and has up to date songs I love that I can listen to my fav songs now thank u for making this !!!!!!! Btw u should listen to the song bellas lullaby when u get it it's a beautiful song I think u guys would like it ps. It's from twilight :p I hope this comment was helpful for u if not it's ok ps. Don't forget to listen to the song ;) thanks buh bai
Spotify,used to like it,"The Beckers (Tara,Rudy, Raina,Lorelei, & Adelaide)",15-Sep-15,2,"And one point the app recognised my 7&#34; kindle as a tablet which I mean isn't it??? And I could choose a song,I still had adds bit I didn't have to just shuffle. Then one day the app updated and my kindle was recognised as a mobile device and I can only shuffle. So I just got tired of only getting recommended songs.I just use YouTube or Soundcloud even Pandora."
Spotify,GREAT OLD TIME country music!!!!!!,Amazon Customer,23-Feb-17,5,"I hadn't heard Barbara Mandrel in years! It's GREAT to get to hear her as much as I want now.I love the OLD country music myself.Conway.Merle etc.Thx Spotify,Your're the BEST!  CAROL"
Spotify,4-Stars,AndrewN,4-Sep-16,4,"I gave this 4 stars for one reason - There are times when I'm listening to a song and then out of the blue - it just cuts off. Why does this happen? I can be enjoying a real good song that I added to my up next listen and minutes later, it just shifts songs, without notice. Really annoying! Over all, I love spotify. Fix this problem and I'll be golden. :)"
Spotify,I'm my own DJ!!!,MamaK,11-Oct-16,5,"I have been impressed with Spotify and the choices in songs available to me!  I love creating my playlist to fit my moods and activities.  Sometimes I feel nostalgic and want to hear an all 80's line-up to listen and remember.  But other times I just want to work out to Springsteen,  Billy Joel, Elton John and too many more to list!  With Spotify I can personalize my playlists any way I want.  When you've got a must have song and you want it to appear several times throughout the playlist?  You can make that happen with Spotify!  I can even listen to my Christian music all day long and never run out of song choices.  You can even listen to playlists that have already been put together if you don't want to create your own.  Add songs or remove songs anytime to make a playlist truly your own!  Gotta love it!"
Spotify,Fun,susan patterson,9-Jul-17,5,"Great tunes, easy to use"
Spotify,Game changer for music lovers,Roger E.,2-Sep-16,5,"My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials"
Spotify,Great App!,K. Selby,25-Dec-14,4,"Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion, because you can make your own playlist, with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips, but more, it seems, than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most  unknown to the people around me. Over all, a really fantastic app.Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD, and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them."
Spotify,Best app ever,valeria saltos,27-Jan-17,5,I love this app!!
Spotify,Excellent,Amazon Customer,26-Dec-16,5,This is a lit app. Works well on the Fire tablet.
Spotify,Love Spotify,Charles J Walker,13-May-16,4,"Love Spotify, I pay for the premium sub which lets you save over 3000 tracks for offline play. Commercial radio is dead - Spotify is expanding podcast support making it a great audio choice whatever your preferences."
Spotify,Meh..,Isaac,4-Mar-15,2,"Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."
Spotify,It's great,Brownie,30-Jan-17,5,Great app_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç love it
Spotify,Great !!!!!!,Mark Blair,9-Jul-16,5,It's a great way of listening to music
Spotify,premium is worth the $,sarah lyons,9-Jan-16,5,"We have premium, so no ads, and can play songs in any order we want. My husband, kids and teenager, and I all have our own playlists and can listen on any device, even at the same time, on the same account. We use the 'listen offline' option all the time! No internet, no problem!  However, you can't set parental controls, which means the teenager has to be careful, otherwise the younger kids get explicit music showing up in their feed. I think if we paid $5 more we could have individual accounts for family members? Anyway, its a great app."
Spotify,Spotify App has Limitations,Tracey C. Taylor,3-Mar-15,3,"I love Spotify. I'll say that right now. I have it on my iMac, my iPad, and on my kindle, and I don't even pay for premium. I am, however, very disappointed with the kindle spotify app. I can still make playlists and listen to radio, but I have a limited number of skips and it never plays the song I want it to. It shuffles and suggests songs constantly and also plays songs over again. What I don't understand it why I have these limitations on my kindle but not on my iPad or iMac. Is Apple so superior that I can't have the same update on my kindle??"
Spotify,"Worked great, Now almost unusable",Christin Hobbs,20-Jan-15,2,"At first this app worked great in my office at work for several weeks. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, it can't get through a single song without skipping or dropping the song. I tried adjusting the settings. This did not help. I also tried downloading the songs to my device. This seemed to help slightly, but songs are still skipping or failing to play. It doesn't seem to be a problem with my network as other streaming apps (I.e. Pandora) seem to be working just fine. I'm about to drop my spotlight premium subscription if this issue is not resolved"
Spotify,LOVE Spotify!,PenguinMom,16-Feb-17,5,Wonderful app--better than Google Play or Pandora.  It gives me a lot more listening  options.  I can select the artists or songs I want.
Spotify,Great design,Jeremy Mion,12-Jun-14,5,This app works exactly like the desktop version and allows you to do everthing that you would with the pc version of the software. The offline function works like it should. I would remcomend this app to anybody that needs the spotify app to be abble to login to there spotify acount. I love the prenium option of being able to put music offline. It is like having an MP3 with all the music you can possibly think of. AMAZING service.
Spotify,Solid,Fonz,1-Apr-17,5,Works as advertised
Spotify,um ... well,um...it sometimes never loads,2-Jan-15,2,"Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen .  .  . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
Spotify,Get it if you are picky about songs.,Luv Unicorns,8-Apr-17,5,"I love this app it is the best apps ever it is 1 out of the 7 apps I downloaded on my Tablet but if you are not patient then sorry , every 30 minutes they give you like 2 or 3 adds no biggie.

Spotify,Super,Renee,24-Jun-14,4,Love it!!!  Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it.  Have suggested it to a couple friends that didn't know about it.
Spotify,Great music app,Amazon Customer,28-Apr-17,5,I love this app and it's premium. All in all its easy to use and has most songs! _Ÿ˜ƒ_Ÿ˜ƒ
Spotify,I love it!,Jandroid,18-Jan-17,5,I love streaming music. Every album I've wanted to listen to is there. I get the premium update when I know I'll have more time for music and cancel it easily when I don't. I try all kinds of music because there's no risk. No one likes buying a disc they end up not wanting. Spotify has an excellent variety of music.There's no need to store things. It's great for people who don't have tons of space for CD towers. I am in my mid 50's and find that this is easy to use. It's not just for millennials.
Spotify,Really???!!!,Shadow_Angel,26-Dec-16,3,I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can't get this. I still have it but I'm really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I'll get rid of it and I really don't want to because I like it but if you don't fix it's gonna go :/
Spotify,Eh... but good,Avery,23-Jun-14,4,"Unless you have premium, it kinda sucks because you can't listen to songs on demand; only shuffle. But rather than that, it's a great app! Easy setup,"
Spotify,really?,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-16,2,"You guys are idiots, why allow this app to be used without premium if youre going to make sure it doesnt work after so long without premium, the heck, I have a 3 playlists and what they cant work without premium? This is frickin stupid."
Spotify,Spotify is cool,J.J. Jackson,22-Sep-16,4,"Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I've experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."
Spotify,that's my jam;),Shonda Rife,14-Oct-14,4,This app is so fun.But there is one tiny catch if you are trying to fknd asong and you don't know what the title is its very hard to find.But other than that this app is off the hook.You can listen to certain songs.But  you have to have an account. And that's free to and its so easy to make the a account. This app is so fun. My favorite songs is Birdwalk by soulja boy.Well that's all I'm telling you you can find out the rest when you get this app.You need to get this app. You will be doing me a huge favor.
Spotify,_Ÿ’˜ it!,Tim Brown,30-Jun-17,5,Spotify is amazing and a fantastic app. I love how it's integrated with other devices and I can control em all at the same time.
Spotify,good,Amazon Customer,29-Jun-17,5,Easy to use and doesn't limit music played like other similar apps
Spotify,Spotify is spot on,Shurbelle,11-Apr-16,5,I love spotify.  It's the best music app and I've searched high and low!
Spotify,Best Music App ever.,anonomouso&szlig;s,31-Jul-14,5,"This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. It's beautiful, chic and it has great sound quality.ignore old review of this, it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads, but they're not very common. Also it's has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you'll ever make."
Spotify,Excellent spotify!,two little scallywags,10-Jun-14,5,I can't find fault with this app. It's excellent. I love music and spotify is a dream come true for music lovers. Every artist and every song I look for I find. Keep up the great work spotify
Spotify,"Great, but...",Kurtkahoot,23-Mar-17,3,"Spotify is amazing, except for the fact that every time I open it, it says there's no internet connection, when there CLEARLY is. Because of this, I have had to (for the past two weeks) delete the app almost daily (1-2 times) and redownload it. It frustrates me how slow it is sometimes and I am contemplating on whether I should delete Spotify for good. On the other hand, I use it every time I use my tablet (it's great to use while getting ready!) I enjoy that you can make playlists, follow them, save songs, etc. I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys listening to music frequently, but be aware if it says there's no internet connection. I don't know if it's just my tablet or not, to be honest. âœ¨"
Spotify,A boon to music appreciation and musicianship.,Amazon Customer,14-Jan-17,5,I've found songs I thought I'd never find again. I even discovered a new favorite tune that if not for Spotify would not have. Spotify is a revolutionary development to today's music lover.
Spotify,love love love,NEpixie69,14-Jun-14,5,I love my personalized mood boosting and long drive up beat playlists without commercials. Love spotify because it has shown me new artists and sounds i had forgotten about over the years. Definitely my kind of station.
Spotify,"While the ads are super annoying, more annoying is the constant ""suggested songs""",D,2-Jan-17,2,"I have the free version. While the ads are super annoying, more annoying is the constant ""suggested songs""."
Spotify,"Oh yes, wonderful!",Jonathan Knighton,19-Feb-17,5,Play while playing or working on your tablet etc.  The beauty that is the music via Spotify is right here.
Spotify,I love the app but...,Someone,15-Sep-15,3,"I am in love with Spotify, but ever since there are two problems I with the new update:1) You can no longer choose a certain song, you must always click the shuffle button and skip untill you find the song you want to hear.2) If you are listening your own playlist, the app now adds recommended songs on there too.Honestly, I think this made the app a lot less enjoyable, and I find it annoying.  I think if they want to recommend you songs, they should e-mail you them like the old way."
Spotify,"Love spotify, but app needs work",Hodag Family,25-Sep-15,3,"The app regularity &#34;skips&#34;, similar to like what would happen if you bump a CD player.  It doesn't cause the app to lock up or anything, but is annoying none the less.  This happens in offline mode so it isn't caused by an unreliable network connection.  This is on a fire phone."
Spotify,Crazy Song app,Roberts Family,21-Feb-17,5,Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that.
Spotify,I always use this app!,United States citizen,25-Jun-14,5,I was looking for good music apps and I don't really like pandora...it doesn't have enough skips and u don't know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this 10 stars if I could!
Spotify,Completely blew my mind! { Please read my Review },kstarnes,21-Mar-17,5,"I got Spotify a couple years ago. I do not have Premium, (for those of you who don't know what that is, it is the version of Spotify that you pay for.)  However even without Premium, Spotify is an all around amazing music app! I have never really had any trouble with it, and it plays all of my music like a breeze. I happen to have gotten Spotify when it wasn't really a big music app, and even then it worked great! It updates every now and then and makes it better pretty much every time. I would highly recommend this incredible app, especially to music lovers that just need a good music app. It has a lot of features including, following music artists, creating your own playlists, picking who you want to listen to, and you can also go to the ""Browse"" section and from there pick from a lot of genres and even sleeping sounds to help you sleep. There are radio stations to listen to as well. Great app! I would say the best ages that should get this app are, 11 and up. Depending. I love Spotify and if you get it,  (which you should) then you will too! Thank you for reading this I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to get this amazing app."
Spotify,I love this app,BadBloodNelson,3-Mar-17,5,I love this app. Deleted IHeartRadio and several other less desirable ones after discovering this app! I love Spotify! If only I could afford the subscribtion!
Spotify,If I Could Give It a Perfect 10 I Would,Sunshine South reader,3-May-16,5,"I was reluctant to try this (ironically enough) because it's free and I figured the whole ""you get what you pay for"" adage is an adage for a reason. When Beats Music got bought out I figured I'd give Spotify a go before signing up with another subscription service. It's the best decision I've made in a long time."
Spotify,Bruh ._.,Mushroom Creepers,22-Jun-16,4,"Okay so I update spotify and it says I have NO internet while I'm clearly connected to the internet. I also hate how 3/4 of the options are only for Premium. This makes me an unhappy customer, I'm not going to waste my time buying some Premium when I could easily get my favorite songs from YouTube to mp3."
Spotify,assuming you aren't into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they DON'T have,Joshua,1-Mar-16,4,"It's Spotify....nothing to complain about, assuming you aren't into one of like five obscure Italian punk rap bands they DON'T have.No tricksy hobbitses to be found here, you just drop a $10 every month and you get unlimited access to basically every song out there to download and play whenever. Shuffle is pretty meh (it definitely doesn't cycle through your whole list like it should) but I really can't complain about the 600+ songs I've gotten for pocket change."

Spotify,Great!!,Shanamarie Rushing,12-Oct-16,4,This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome.
Spotify,They pissed  me off!,Lena smith,23-Nov-14,2,"This app is great but my favorite artist was taken down, like all of her good country songs and now they only have her stupid pop songs. I need my Taylor swift back!"

When I'd like to listen to one song in my own playlist, and she wants to listen to a song in hers, my tablet will play the same song she's playing on her separate iphone se, and vice versa, I can't listen to anything without it playing on her phone, I don't like it.

Spotify,Awesome,Jenna,17-Jun-14,5,It's amazing to listen to any song from any artist. I don't have premium and that's not a problem I can listen to the songs I downloaded on my Kindle when I don't have internet. All and all spotify provides something I just cannot find with Pandora.GOOD JOB SPOTIFY
Spotify,Great for Sleeping,Christina C. Bronson,28-Nov-16,5,I used to have pretty bad sleep insomnia but this app solved my problem theThe doctor recommended a sound box for goin to sleep but I made a jazzPlaylist and this app was a gold medalist in my Olympics this app is also theKing of the music jungle
Spotify,This app is awesome,SYDNEY'S review,11-Dec-16,5,"This app is awesome!! You can pick any song you want to listen too. You can listen to new hits or the 50's. One thing is, the songs that have curse words in them say it and they don't block it out, so I wouldn't pick songs that have curse words in it. Good luck!"
Spotify,meh,Ashley S.,2-Oct-15,2,Can only play shuffled. Can't just listen to an album from beginning to end. Ads are way too loud. Much louder than the music. I find myself ripping out my ear phones when an ad starts even though the music itself wasn't very loud.
Spotify,******,John F. Howes,27-Apr-17,5,Great the best
Spotify,Free with a catch,D. Acree,23-Jul-14,2,GREAT if you don't mind NOT choosing your own songs even ones you own.  I find it annoying that you can't play a specific song unless you have a one song playlist and even then you get the crummy suggestion.I like Pandora better personally. I can at least listen to the one song I want to hear or someone else hear without issue. Spotify on the pc is the way to go.$10 a month premium is just too much would rather watch movies for that kind of money.
Spotify,Ughh,Tia McLeMore,22-Nov-15,3,This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It doesn't continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it'll play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it's the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it's a necessary evil.
Spotify,HOW DO I GET PREMIUM?!,S b,17-May-16,3,This app is cool! I got the free trial for spotify premium but it ended. How do I upgrade it to premium?!?! PLEASE HELP! IM NOT ENJOYING IT AS WELL!!!

Spotify,Amazing,Brooke Cornett,16-Jan-17,5,"I've always thought Pandora was a bit stupid, playing music similar to yours instead of the music you like, and soundcloud just didn't have a good selection. Spotify has an enormous selection, minimal ads, and high quality audio, and that's just the base app, you can get premium and have unlimited skips, no ads, and even higher quality music, not that you really need higher quality. Overall one of my favourite apps."
Spotify,Best App I have ever used so far!,Amazon Customer,10-Dec-16,5,I just love the app. I have installed it on my iPad and my BlackBerry as well as on my laptop. It works well on all three. There is always something new to listen to when I am feeling like something different. I have discovered many new artists that otherwise would have remained unknowned to me and bought their songs afterward. Works with or without wifi or internet connection and can be shared. I am really impressed!
Spotify,so in love wit u Spotify!!,khiry,17-Sep-14,5,"I loooove this app. All the music I want , and can create my own playlist too!!....man!!!....I'm in music Heaven"
Spotify,BEST app for music,MacF,17-Mar-17,5,"I can't even express how much I love this app. I've tried iheartradio, the Windows music thing, iTunes, and this, and Spotify is the best out of all of them. I had been using the Windows music thingy (I forget what it's called lol) but I needed an app for my kindle that does the same thing-- Spotify is that app, only its better than what I was using. You don't have to download the music-- it's all there in Spotify's massive library of songs, albums, artists, and more. You can create playlists, listen to songs, save music, and much more. Only on some occasions do you ever search for a song and see its not there-- about 98% of songs you search for are there. I found out about Spotify because my friend recommended it to me and at first I was a little skeptical because you have to sign up for it, but everything (even the deluxe albums) are still FREE. My dad asked me if it was legal because everything is free and yes, Spotify is 100% legit and legal-- they get there money from 30 second ads about every 15 songs or so. The only small error I ever encountered was sometimes it takes a minute to load, but that's probably just my old kindle. This app is also compatible with every single device I've ever used. Overall, I love this app and I hope you get it because it took me a long time to type this"
Spotify,alright but.......,Someone,23-Mar-16,3,I deleted it by mistake and downloaded it again but I could not sign back i n because I had forgotten my password. It did not give me an option to change my password . I could not make a new a count because it said my email was already taken. I would not rament this app for two reasons:One if youndelete it you never get it backTwo they don't have popular artists thet kids now a days loveDO NOT GET THIS APP
Spotify,Where's my song?,LG,22-Jun-17,4,Specific song by Johnny Guitar Watson not in library of his works. I do like that you can download specific songs as opposed to entire album or having to create a station.
Spotify,... to navigate but I am sure it will be better when I learn the ins and outs,Virginia,13-Jun-17,4,Still learning how to navigate but I am sure it will be better when I learn the ins and outs.
Spotify,Spotlight:,Fran W.,21-Nov-16,5,I find the variety of music offered by Spodify to be phenomenal. Such a wide variety of music. The cost for a prime subscription is so reasonable. I thoroughly enjoy searching for music I love and listening to it through this app. FIW of ATL
Spotify,No,Elizabeth Crowder,26-Dec-16,2,"This app does not letme listen to music the way I want to, unless I spend money."
Spotify,m,Angela Sheffield,2-Apr-16,5,Most helpful app
Spotify,Great free music,Kelly McCord -Schneidewent,16-Aug-17,5,Great free music or may pay for specific type of music W/O commercials.
Spotify,Not only is the premium service only worth the money ...,Emily,3-Feb-16,2,Not only is the premium service only worth the money if I'm using it on mobile but the free version is so irritating it basically forces you to upgrade. While it's perfectly reasonable for ads to play when using a free service I noted two things recently after years of using it: 1) an average of three adds ran in between each song - a rate that even Pandora never uses and 2) ads ran when I played my own local files.
Spotify,Great music,Darlene D.,19-Aug-17,5,Great music and I enjoy every minute
Spotify,A must have app for your music,debbie p.,7-Oct-17,5,Love Love it...Every song I have requested has always been available...Thanks for providing us with the best music app out there!!
Spotify,Best app ever!,BK,7-Feb-17,5,"This app is like a best friend that is always there for you.  The music encourages me, comforts me, opens my eyes, cheers me up, makes me happy and more! I just love the music so much! There is ALWAYS more to listen to. And you get to listen to what you like and want when you want to! It is amazing and totally FREE if you don't get premium. Which you already have the full package without premium!"
Spotify,Pretty awesome app.,J.W.,11-Sep-15,4,"I am officially a hooked on Spotify listener/ user. I love the variations in stations, weather it be in genres or moods, Spotify has it ALL! I particularly like the Discovery Weekly playlist which stays in tuned with what you like listening to, keeps you up to speed with fresh music and a lil hint of older hits.Definitely recommend Spotify to others to experience, listen and enjoy its splendor! _Ÿ˜‰_Ÿ™Œ_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ_¶_Ÿ_µ_Ÿ“»_Ÿ_§"
Spotify,It's better on Amazon than android,Kindle Customer,18-May-17,5,It's amazing
Spotify,Spotify is Spot On!,Kindle Customer,19-Jun-14,5,"Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better!  The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch.  Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me.  Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!"
Spotify,Luv it,Siya,29-Jun-17,5,It is such a great APP
Spotify,Issues,Darkfireangel,3-Nov-15,2,"I have been using this on my phone and Kindle. At first, I loved it. Much better than Pandora. But streaming now sucks. I have a perfect internet connection, and it does the same thing on other Wi-Fi and on mobile networks. It stops randomly saying that there is no internet connection. All the time. I've looked it up, called support, and nothing fixes it. If it gets fixed, I'll give it five stars. A shame, really."
Spotify,My First Choice for Music,Catherine Martinique,18-Jun-17,4,It's pretty good. I wish I would have signed up for premium when it first came out.
Spotify,No adds awsome,Works so good,27-Jun-17,5,Omg this is the best app a talking about no adds love this app

Spotify,it great!! Can't do with out my music,Amazon Customer,14-Sep-17,5,"Been with Spotify for a couple of years now, it great!! Can't do with out my music. Get what you want, when you want it! What could be better than that??"

Spotify,Great!,Soniesosavvy,29-Nov-16,5,I love this app it's like..the best it's better then Pandora! Like if your on tablet and computer you get to choose free songs and you can pay for the premium. I recommend this for music lovers! Thank you Spotify!!
Spotify,Take advantage of the 3 month trial!,Elizabeth,15-Jan-16,5,I love Spotify! I am currently taking advantage of the .99 3 month trial. The benefits are wonderful. No commercials and no data usage. It's not worth the higher monthly fee to me once the trial expires so at that point I will be cancelling premium and going back to the free version. It doesn't use a ton of data and I can deal with the commercials to have the ability to choose my favorite music!
Spotify,Great app,Faith Manning,23-Nov-16,5,"Runs great, love how on my tablet I can pick my music and not have to keep it on shuffle like I have to do on my phone. Also customer service was great when I needed help with app one time great app."
Spotify,Recommendable Account of a Spiritual Journey,Amazon Customer,16-Jul-14,4,"Atkinson's account of (presumably) his own spiritual search and awakening experience lends us a first-hand perspective, with which I at least could identify.It presents universal truths in an understandable way, and drives home the message that ""this could be need me, too"".Though a bit antiquated, I enjoyed his style and setting and found it entertaining as well as enlightening."
Spotify,The greatest music app.,Andrew Twork,19-Nov-16,5,This app is great and I have it on all my devices that are compatible
Spotify,Still a few key albums missing,Nichole,27-Oct-16,4,90% of the music I listen to is found on spotify. So it's worth the $5.
Spotify,I like it but,Thais Chapman,27-Jul-16,4,"I like it but the songs skip during playback...EVERY TIME!!! It doesn't seem to matter what device I'm using, wired or wireless. At times, it makes me hesitant to use when I also have Amazon Prime competing for my attention."

Spotify,Love this app,big chief,21-Jun-16,5,Love this app.  I do not pay for music anymore.  You can create playlist.  Listen to them on shuffle.  You occasionally hear a commercial.  But it is free music.  Sometimes you can watch an ad and get a half hour of commercial free music.  Awesome app.

Spotify,Love Spotify,Vicstro,8-May-17,5,"Ever since I got it, I can't get enough.  I use it to work out, I use it for my daughter to fall asleep. I use it for my son."
Spotify,Great mixes too,SEAN M MCHALE,30-Dec-16,5,"Yes you can find pretty much any song on Spotify, but the best part of it is the playlist selection they have, especially the ones based on songs you already listen to."
Spotify,New update :(,liyah,12-Sep-15,2,"I loved spotify until they got their new update. Now it'd similar to pandora and you can't choose what song , you can't listen to a specific song, and there is no longer a queue so you can't know what song your going to listen to. I hate the new update, now you only can use those things if you purchase the premium :( spotlight is a good app but now it's just not as good."
Spotify,"Downloading once again, love it.",M.G,8-Jun-17,5,"Had this for my tv, getting it for my tablet again!"
Spotify,"Good, but buggy on Kindle",Ryan Ramos,13-Apr-17,3,"On any other device, I would probably give this a 5/5, but there are certain bugs on the Kindle that desperately need fixing. For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."
Spotify,at first I saw my cousin have it then I wanted it and I forgot it I did not know what it was called I did not want my,teen catalogs,2-Jul-14,5,At first I saw my cousin have it then I wanted it and forgot it. I did not know what it was called I did not ask my cousin for the name I got the name bye her saying to her mom spotify is great and when I went to find out what the name was by looking for a music app and I am happy now.

Spotify,I heart spotify,Chulo Skylark,4-Jan-17,5,Retired baby boomer with huge music collection. Spotify gives me easy access to hear the artists I like and helps me discover new talent. Like Lorene Scafaria. And Sturgill Simpson.
Spotify,Great with one exception,donna lupton,30-Sep-16,4,I love Spotify! The only thing I wish they would change is making the ads more personalized so there is no chance of seeing offensive ads while enjoying the musical experience
Spotify,Love it!!!,_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜_,6-May-17,5,Such a good music app! I love it!!!
Spotify,What Happened??,kksim1212,17-Nov-15,2,"I have been using this app for almost a year, and I loved it. Now though the stupid thing will not let me chose a song unless I pay for it what the hell I am not dealing with this it I wanted a limited number of skips and to not be able to chose the song I would have use I heart radio or Pandora. This is soo not my favourite app anymore, back to youtube it is."
Spotify,Great free music and podcasts,Julie ODonnell,7-Dec-16,5,"Great free music and podcasts.  Spotify does have a no add premium option for a monthly cost but I don't mind the ads for free music I can choose. Huge variety, categories and specialized mood/activity lists. Good way to keep up on the new and upcoming artists. Also fun to check out unexplored genres and podcasts. Overall great service!"
Spotify,LOVVEEE!!!,Maureen LoPiccolo,29-Jun-17,5,"You have to pay to go ad-free,but the adds don't show up too often! _Ÿ’™_Ÿ’œ_Ÿ’™_Ÿ’œ"
Spotify,Love it,K. L. Santos,11-Oct-16,5,Everything in one app from Metal to ambience!
Spotify,Love my Spotify!,Kindle Customer,20-Nov-16,4,"Sure, I wish Spotify was less expensive or totally free!  Who doesn't?!  Although it stops playing and I can't figure out why.  Sometimes, it won't allow my ""play next/que"" to work properly!  And that makes me very sad!The monthly charge needs to be cheaper!  Play next should Always be free!"
Spotify,Perfect,Bob K,15-Dec-16,5,"The best music library of any service.  Music discovery is very robust, either by searching popular songs by artists or by the Spotify curated playlists."
Spotify,Parker Ouellette,Wendy Ouellette,19-Nov-16,5,THIS IS THE BEST
Spotify,worst update,Great,23-Sep-15,1,Ever since the new update it has disabled you to turn off shuffle. It it gives you ads that are more consistent than before. The app restricts your ability of listening to your music when you want and what you want to play. Overall it has given more ads limited the amounts of skips and only allows you to shuffle play which may play songs that don't fit your mood.
Spotify,I love Spotify! Spotify premium is totally worth it,Amazon Customer,23-Jul-16,3,"I love Spotify! Spotify premium is totally worth it. The only problem I am having is that the app tends to act up. I'll skip a song, and the next song will play but the first song will still be shown in the notification bar. When I click on the song to get to the app, Spotify doesnt respond and I have to close it. It's so frustrating."
Spotify,More Restrictions,Julie,29-Oct-16,2,It used to be great but it's getting more and more restricted.  The app won't let you connect to external speakers without paying which seems unfair.  I'd rather just use Pandora.
Spotify,Billy Blob _Ÿ˜¯_Ÿ˜¯_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜ˆ_Ÿ˜±_Ÿ˜±_Ÿ˜—_Ÿ˜__Ÿ’©_Ÿ™__Ÿ™ˆ,Amazon Customer,1-Apr-17,5,I like this music player beacuse it has so many songs and even some videos  ypou can surck your favorite songs in and make a play list I like it so much.
Spotify,Perfect,Jessi Ruggles,27-Jun-16,5,"Way better than Pandora or any other music app I've tried, its also way cheaper than using iTunes since you don't have to pay for the songs you add. I love the fact that you can make your playlists how you want and if you have premium you can play any song you want whenever you want and play songs in whatever order you want all the time."
Spotify,Spotify Review,Nicholas Taylor,25-Jun-14,4,THIS APP IS AMAZING... I have this also for my computer and Ipod.. The one part I hate about it on my kindle fire is that you cannot pick what song you want to listen to it is just a shuffle play unless you want to pay. You get a certain amount of skips and I didn't know that so I just wasted all of them thinking I had unlimited.
Spotify,loved it! until...,a.awesomeperson,27-Jun-14,4,great app!!!! i loved it but it suddenly started saying that i cant listen to my already downloaded music until i got premium and it wont let me get premium

I had to go a couple months without premium and it seemed as bad as listening to Pandora, but the premium is definitely worth the $9.99 a month in my opinion. Definitely one app I rather not go without."
Spotify,really spotify,hannah josephine shirley,15-Nov-15,1,It was amazing in till they updated it now you don't get to pick what song you listen to......it's stupid and sucks.....if I had a chance I would change it back to the old version

Spotify,Ich finde dies 'hella danmn gut! ya?!?,rick wolf,16-Sep-14,5,"I likes this one real good. It is better than the YouTube for straight music listening. One does not need to sift through 'covers' or sound quality and the tracks are delineated with shuffling, queuing, communities, following and such. Basic one is free, or a monthly fee version with more features that are worth the expense, is the upgrade."

On thepc version you can pick Iif you want to shuffle or not and the android version yoi have no choice. Besides that it is an excellent app and I am keeping it my phone until I upgrade :)
Spotify,AMAZING,MadisonMusic,16-Sep-14,5,I absolutely love this app. I have it on Amazon Kindle and Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. Absolutely the best music app I've found yet!
Spotify,Great Music Streaming,Austin Lasater,30-Jul-16,4,"The app is great because the concept of music streaming is great. The only thing I wish the app did is something the PC does- see what friends are listening to. If the app had a page for keeping up with friends and seeing their current listening, I'd easily consider this a 5 star app."
Spotify,I like the product; I don't know yet whether I like $10 a month worth yet.,Kindle Customer,21-Jun-16,3,"Honestly,it's too early for me to conclude anything about Spotify music except that I definitely don't like the commercials.  I'm already paying for Pandora One, and their price seems more reasonable.  I'm going to give this one a while longer at this time. Maybe I will change my mind."

Spotify,And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man,LuvMyLife,14-Oct-16,1,"This shuts down my new Apple desktop, for some reason! It always has! And it probably always will...It's probably because you're trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man, & passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"
Spotify,The Best,Jayne,4-Jun-17,5,"Love, love Spotify. Premium is a bit pricey at $10/month. Maybe they should consider a hybrid premium. Keep the ads but give premium access for $5/month."

It works better on Passports. The experience I've had with this app is choppiness. Lag. freezes. crashes. unresponsiveness. It's just the worse. Spotify you guys have to make an application especially for Blackberries. Put it up on the BB world. Please. This sucks. And I'm a premium user for this s***? F that.

Spotify,Free app is useless,PunyaReviews,16-Apr-16,1,"Best music streaming app if you're on premium. Worst app imaginable if you're on free subscription and a music lover who loves to listen to specific songs and artists. Someone like me. Even the most basic thing like choosing your own music isn't permitted, even on a limited basis. Not recommended if you aren't ready to spend $10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there's no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. _Ÿ˜”"

Spotify,It's Strength Is Its Library of Music,Kindle Customer,16-May-16,5,"I'm two weeks into the free test drive of the premium website. The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's wasn't available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify.  (Of course, for what amounts to $120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that's not available on Prime.)  Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like.  From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."

I may give it another chance but the initial launch was a fail."
Spotify,Spotify is just what I needed to help with my music obsession,Susan Tomlinson,3-Apr-16,5,"I listen to music for hours (10+) every day from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night. I have a rather large and unwieldy music collection ranging from hundreds of vinyl albums to cassette mix tapes (remember those?) to CDs to untold mp3s. SPOTIFY is a place I can almost always count on to have all my music collection queued and ready to play anywhere I'm online. Then, there's all the music I've yet to discover, old and new. Even listening all the time is not enough to even scratch the surface on new releases. I am frugal, but 9.99 a month is well worth it to me. I love Spotify."
Spotify,Cool,N,25-Jun-17,5,I can control what I am listening to on my Kindle with my iPhone. Pretty cool but not a big deal. I love spotify regardless....nice to see what devices are available when you look at settings.
Spotify,Works great. I use Spotify mobile app on W8 phone ...,burnt toast,19-Oct-14,5,"Works great.  I use Spotify mobile app on W8 phone & Kindle Fire.  No issues.  I heard some reviews complain abut the shuffle play being only play back option.  The Spotify app does make it appear the only playback option is Shuffle Play as button is prominent on top play list, but to bypass just click  on first song to start playing music and the songs will continue to play in descending order as your playlist is built.  Enjoy.  Now for the Amazon Fire HD music app - go back to school or at least try and mimic Spotify if you want to have any success."

When BlackBerry Q10 arrived they stopped supporting this platform, but I managed to find a client that still did the job verry well. Since this week I was forced to move to the latest version in the app store here (old version was 'not supported anymore'). Now my BlackBerry passport crashes all the time, offline mode can't be activated anymore and I need to login everytime I start up Spotify + battery drains... Ones you are addicted they take advantage of you. Make your own playlists with your own music in the device's native client and realize the control you lose when these cloudbased solutions are out of the 'yes we have another customer mode!' and leave you in the dark without access to what feels like your music collection!"

Spotify,Not family-friendly...,lkswimmer525,9-Nov-15,1,"While I do like that Spotify, unlike Pandora, plays what you actually search for right off the bat, I chose to stick with Pandora as it allows you to filter out explicit content. True, Spotify will play edited albums if you search for them,  but there's no telling what else will start playing in that station. I used up all of my skips and still got stuck with a song that swore a lot (that was just on an Angels & Airwaves station. They rarely swear but I was playing an edited album just to be safe). If Pandora's license allows them to give users the option to filter explicit content, surely Spotify should be able to as well."

Spotify,what happened?,Natascha McAninch,8-Oct-15,2,"I've had spotify on my kindle for the almost three years, and its been great to me the whole time: I could find just about any song I wanted, queue up my own playlist in the order I want, and listen to individual songs at my leisure. It must have happened just today because I still had all these freedoms when I was listening to my music last night, but the most recent update is upsetting, to say the least. This once wondrous app which once gave me free access to a complete library all in the order I wanted, is now as crappy as the mobile app for phones. I really loved this app before then, it was the quickest and easiest way to listen to music how I wanted, but now I can only shuffle my playlists. NOTHING ELSE. To the creators of this app, I don't think you fully realize how absolutely frustrating it is when you want nothing more than to listen to certain songs, but because of the recent update on the app you have to pray that you can find the right song in the limited number of skips the app gives you, and when you don't, you feel an empty depression form in your chest. I know the quick and easy way to solve this would be to buy spotify premium, but guess what?? Not everyone can afford to spend $24 a month+ just for music!!!! :D SO glad to see that this app is now more concerned with getting rich than the value of sharing wonderful music with everyone! I'll definitely be looking for other apps now that offer the same wide library but free access to order the songs as you wish.This app WAS great, but overnight I'm assuming some corporate bum took over and decided to rob half the world of music. Good on you, bub. :')"

Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you won't have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded  devices, you don't have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it's no issue for me at all. Besides that, this app is great for all the people who need to listen to music ln a daily basis. On VERY rare occasion does it crash btw."

This is going to get out to people thinking of buying a kindle and once they hear about the spotify changes and if they use spotify religiously this is going to discourage them and that is going to mean way less sales of kindle`s and is going to make them choose a different device so good job Amazon for letting this happen.

Spotify,Horrible... And A Complete Waste.,Dj,24-Aug-14,1,Well I did like the app because of the 7 day trial but afterwards it didn't tell me how to get premium. I searched every part I could of the app and still could find no information on how to get premium. I use my kindle fire for this but I don't think that's the problem. I tried un-installing it and restalling it because it wouldn't fully get an update. It kept saying it couldn't finish installing. So I tried re-installing it only to see that it still couldn't fully get installed. Ive spent days trying to set this up and make it work only to see that I wasted my time. This app is a waste of time so don't install it... its completely worthless.
Spotify,Five Stars,Chris h.,1-Jan-15,5,Good music app
Spotify,I hate this app because though it has a lot of ...,HeirloomCountryFarms,27-Oct-14,1,"I hate this app because though it has a lot of music, it doesn't allow for more than a few skips of disliked songs AND if I don't have enough songs on a playlist like more than five or six, it forcefully adds MORE from other artists it THINKS are similar onto MY playlist. NOPE! I DELETED it and replaced it with Tunein and IHeartRadio, which are much MORE user friendly in MY opinion."
Spotify,One Star,Tracy,20-Nov-14,1,Sad.
Spotify,Could be better.,Katherine Cole,10-Aug-14,1,Can't skip songs.
Spotify,WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME WITH THIS!!!!,Sophia Drake,7-Jun-15,1,"I am very disappointed I thought that I could possibly find something better than Pandora but I was wrong. So for the first few hours Spotify worked, then as I am trying listen to my favorite song it won't play and it will pause on it's own. What's bazzare is that I have a lot of Falling in Reverse and it won't play one single song by the band, but it will work fine on any other song. So basically don't buy the app if you reading this review."
Spotify,One Star,DAVID  FRATICELLI,29-Oct-14,1,NEED TO CANCEL
Spotify,it's so bad...,Robert V.,7-May-15,1,"Unless you pay the premium subscription, this app is nothing but terrible, the same commercial five times in a row every ten minutes, they say they give you 30 minutes ad free if you watch these long videos, but then they force you to listen to whatever garbage they want in order to continue listening to what you want. I only got it because the ps4 got it, but this is horrible."
Spotify,worthless,mshake,12-Feb-15,1,You can't pick any of the songs you want making this pos worthless.

Spotify,One Star,MickeyFan,1-Mar-15,1,I don't appreciate the sneaky ads and unsolicited emails.
Spotify,Not what I'd hoped for,Tracy Rowan,30-Aug-14,3,"I love Spotify.  I don't love the mobile app very much.  Now I understand that a mobile version of the website is going to necessarily be less flexible than the site.  I get that.  But why I'm limited to shuffle play, I don't understand.  Surely that's not a huge memory issue?Here's the thing, I'm a writer..  I put together playlists for each piece I work on and listen to them as I write.  I take a lot of time deciding what the right flow is on my playlists, and hearing them shuffled kind of defeats the whole process.  Yeah, I find it irritating and it's pretty much put paid to the idea of using Spotify on my phone or tablet unless I'm just going to do some random listening."

Spotify,Unhappy Customer,Jansen B.,21-Jun-16,1,I like spotify however I don't like how every option is blocked due to not having premium. I have suggestion that around certain holidays where spotify can be cheaper and have some months free. For example the the months for 99Â¢. I believe that this will ensure more customers and keep some coming back.
Spotify,Awesome!,Kris Milam,29-Jun-16,5,It gives me a bunch of artist that I love and know!Please like if you really like this app._Ÿ˜_
Spotify,A wide range of music.,G Ramsay,25-Jun-14,4,Still learning my way around the site. Great to get the chance to listen to a wide range of music from other countries and broaden the ethnic mix I can appreciate.Brilliant.
Spotify,won't  let you install.,wesley,13-Sep-14,2,At first I liked this app because you could crate your own playlist of your favorite songs but once you delete it you can't get it back. It won't let you install.
Spotify,I love it. But....,Luna_luns,14-May-17,4,"Great app, a lot of songs, easy to find and so easy to use. I love this app. Only one thing bothering me is it's often stop working after using it for five and maybe. And it often happens every single time I use it. I use this app on my fire 8 hd though. It would be great if this problem will be fixed for me me"
Spotify,"Terrible, worthless, useless, clueless and inane.",Captain Neal,12-Nov-15,1,"Garbage. The first thing it did is do away with all my album art. Well, it didn't delete the art because it's part of the MP3 files via a tag editor but for some stupid reason it displayed the art once and then blanks the next time I opened it. My guess is it was going to download its own version of the album and artist art. Phooey on THAT"
Spotify,amazing app,Andrew R.,2-Feb-17,5,Great for music lovers!!
Spotify,Only one problem,Amazon Customer,12-Feb-17,4,"The only problem I have with this app is that Ill get an as saying that if I watch a video then I'll get 30 minutes of as free music, two Songs later I'm getting ads"
Spotify,slow app,Blazz,22-Jun-14,2,"This app is very slow and should be more fluid. UI is not clear too. And I don't understand why mobile spotify plays music in mixed mode, compare to desktop version."
Spotify,used to be good.........,Amazon Customer,10-Sep-15,1,"When I first got this app, it was a dream come true, being able to listen to any song whenever I wanted to (if I had WiFi) and the variety of the radio stations. But a few days ago, the app updated and I have no say in what I listen to unless you have premium and I'm forced to shuffle play but after 5 skips you can't skip anymore. Please fix this and convert back the original version of Spotify where you have the freedom to choose what you listen to and whenever you want to listen to it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you choose if you want the app or not."
Spotify,"Lost important feature then lied, saying they'd make it even better",Tim Sherlock,13-Jan-17,1,"Great until lyrics disappeared, then for months they have strung people along, telling them they're going to fix it. They now use an outside source. You may have to pay extra for the lyrics; I don't know. Seemed like a hassle. I quit them mostly for the way they kept saying it would soon be better than ever. Bull. Felt played, myself."
Spotify,The best ever,this is a great app. you should get this,26-Oct-16,5,Spotify is the nest thing ever. They have almost all artists and music. I would recommend it to anyoneâ˜ºâ˜º
Spotify,Awesome songs,Paula Salsgiver,26-Oct-17,5,Amazing play lists. So many different genres. Finding something different every time I sign in.
Spotify,Sputify,Melon,6-Jun-16,5,"(Yes I intentionally spelled it that way) Its pretty awesome ads are not that often maybe once every 10 songs and they are either 15 or 30 seconds long. Sound quality is amazing! My only wish is I can play music without premium, so when I dont have access (wifi is needed if you dont have premium) I just use my mp3 player when I dont have wifi. Otherwise its awesome I have had playlist with over 300 songs so defiantly a lot of song space in a playlist.  You can even watch the late night show with jimmy fallon so win win over all great app defiantly get it if your looking for music. Sorry for rambling on!"
Spotify,Not kindle friendly,L. A. Rodriguez,19-Jul-15,1,Cannot load on my Kindle
Spotify,Skip City,Jordann Stark,11-Nov-14,1,"Whenever I'm playing music it will stop after every song and won't play until I hit skip song. If anyone knows a fix for this on HDX it would be cool to know. I'm a paying premium user and most the songs are saved to my Kindle, so why? That's my question. Would love to give a 5 star, but until this bug is fixed I cannot rate higher than 1 star :("
Spotify,Sucked,Obake,13-Nov-14,1,"Didn't have the majority of the music I usually listen to and it had trouble launching.  Also, the people that came up with spotify don't think of their listeners. Not everyone is the same. There was a very offensive commercial advertising spotify that kept playing and I got tired of hearing it so now it is uninstalled.  Act professional people."
Spotify,Won't let me play at all,Levi,15-Sep-16,1,"Trying to use spotify on my kindle (it used to work like the desktop version where you could choose any song at any time), but now it won't let me play songs AT ALL, even on shuffle (just keeps popping up with the ""get premium so you can play music anytime, anywhere"" message). If someone could help fix the issue or tell me now to uninstall this update that would be wonderful."
Spotify,Paid premium service required for use with Echo,wrknnwf,2-Apr-16,1,"I was hoping to use this with Amazon Echo, but I see you have to pay for the premium service. I already have several similar free services, so this was not useful to me."

Spotify,I loved this app,Amazon Customer,8-Nov-15,1,"I loved this app! I used it everyday until the recent update locked all my songs and changed it to shuffle only. I have since then stopped using it and returned to youtube because I want to hear my own music. The ads never bothered me, I would deal with them if I could relax to the music I felt like playing at the time. It used to be so simple to use and now it's not. This app is on my kindle and now it just has the phone version of spotify. It's awful."
Spotify,Wants money,Amazon Customer,21-Mar-17,1,Wants money
Spotify,"Terrible, horrible, awefull",Shirley Lawrence,8-Jan-17,1,"I wish I could give this no stars. I tried it on my Alexa app for my Amazon Tap. It won't work on the Alexa without going premium. When I try to delete it from the Alexa app it doesn't show ""unlink account from Alexa"" as instructions says. It only has"" link your account"" I guess the icon and premium connection is stuck on my Alexa app forever. Tried to cancel my account on Spotify website. Can't do that either.  Instructions suck there also. I just want rid of this account and removed from my Alexa app. UGH!!!"

A",Katrina Walker,13-Jun-16,1,"It seemed like there was some popular musicians mixed in with alot more amateur musicians, and I am be nice here.And the worst part Of spotify is the groups and musicans that are popular you could only lesson to one song. But boy you could lesson to the whole ablum by the amateur musicans. The was alot of foreign music. If you are look for some thing likedont even was your free... Try Pandora, its the est and its free to.."

Spotify,and my own library will be just fine.,Dustin Farish,7-Aug-14,1,"I have had the app for three weeks and still can not listen to the songs I want.  Every time I hit play it starts playing the ""recommended"" song which is nothing close to the song I chose.  To top it off I get at least one email a day attempting to sell me a premium membership.  I understand how spotty is supposed to work but my patients attempting to play my selection has worn thin and I will not continue with spotty. Prime music, songza, and my own library will be just fine."
Spotify,Can't login,Cassandra,28-Oct-15,1,"I was told to download this app by a sales rep from my local cell phone provider store. I have tried numerous times to sign up and login but have not been able to. I can't sign up through Facebook because my email is already being used or they are experiencing technical issues, I can't login through email because I have to go through Facebook, I can't contact Spotify because I can't login. I would love to find out why this app has 4.5 stars but I can't even get past the login screen."
Spotify,Horrible,I loved it and it is just great.It feels like real life!,26-Nov-15,1,"This app is falling down the drain. The app once allowed kindle fire users to pick any song on command but now they have took away our ability to do so. We only are capable as working like a mobile device having to click shuffle play in order to play music, even from our play lists. This act they have done is not fair and I vehemently believe we shall be able to freely pick a song on kindle fire tablets."
Spotify,WHY!!!,Silk Touch,24-Sep-14,1,"My brother told me about this and said it was good so I got the app. I had to make a profile, which is acceptable, but then it said I had to confirm it in my email, also acceptable, but I never got an email and it says that my email is already been used and wouldn't let me sign in. Unless you want to go through a bunch of cheap and spend time trying to fix I say NO!!!"

So I'm like OK. So, one three-and-a-half song later, it says: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music and three more ads after that.

I recently sold and bought a new tablet it took a few weeks to come in and of course I wanted spotify! So I logged in and was excited to see everything was still there! Here's where the crap comes in..I noticed I couldn't click on the song I wanted so I thought id just skip through shuffle to find it. Come to find out you can only get 5 skips and you can no longer listen to your songs on demand..This WAS my favorite app but now I see it as a glorified Pandora which angers me.....I suppose ill just use the radio...

Spotify,Worthless,Katrina Johnson,21-Jul-15,1,"I am using the FREE version, and this is what I HATE about it: it dictates the a$$ out of you, not letting you do what you want to do.1.You can't pick and listen to any song you want to at any time. 2.

After complaining to my sister today that the only function I can use on my kindle is the shuffle play (literally EVERYTHING else says it is a premium feature you must pay $10 per month to use), she suggested I look at the PC version... What a difference!! I love the computer version, the kindle app? pretty much  worthless and just  trying to get money. Be wary of the. 5 * reviews... They are either premium users or regarding old versions of this app..."

Spotify,Its really good but one thing,luke walker,2-Feb-17,4,I love it how i can have podcasts and any song i want in one playlist. Just sucks how you need to pay for offline mode.
Spotify,Amazing!,Leah Hoelscher,23-Feb-17,5,One of the best music sites out there! I've been using Spotify for at least 3 weeks and I've loved it ever since I first got it. Definitely recommended!
Spotify,I LOVE IT <3,love bird,18-Dec-16,5,OMG this is the best music app I have ever used they have whatever song u want and u can make ur own play list with the music u would like to hear!!!! I recommend to get this app u will LOVE it soooo much!!!!!

Spotify,Amazing App,Ashley G.,26-Nov-16,5,I love this app it's awesome! I can create my own play lists and make them public to gain followers! Neat! And it has all my favorite music too!
Spotify,Why did you ruin it for us??,Jack's Mom,9-Sep-15,1,"Spotify was great for tablet users. We could listen to any song and only had one ad not too often. Then they added another ad (the most annoying being for Spotify) and started playing them more often. But we put up with it because it was still free and we could still play any song. So much for that. Now we are stuck with shuffle mode. I honestly thought there was something wrong when I tried to play a song but couldn't and was dismayed to realize this was an update. Yes, I am grateful for free music and I still prefer it to Pandora because I can at least choose a playlist but this is an awful change. I have not learned to love Amazon Prime music but I guess it will have to do. Bad move, Spotify. Your service is not worth what you charge for premium and now it is not worth listening to the free service. First world problems, true, but it is a shame to ruin a perfectly good app."
Spotify,"No, just no",Madelyn Frieden,15-Aug-14,1,"I had this app a few months ago and I couldn't stand it because I couldn't access my music. Then, I finally got it again after I deleted it, and I can't even log in. It just freezes after I press the log in button. I do mot recommend this app at all."
Spotify,My Spotify Experience,carol fields,25-Dec-16,5,Spotify is great.  Here you can find so many great songs by many artists.  Spotify definitely is worth every second of great music.
Spotify,Rockin wit the Spotify!,Kindle Lovin' Toni,6-Apr-15,5,"Spotify app is on the money!!!  I use the free version and I love it.  I have found artist and songs that I haven't heard in years.  Spotify is unique in that when you search for an artist you get that artist music only.  If you want similar artist their name and music is to the right side of the page.  No mixing if you don't want to mix.I love being able to listen to a specific entire album(s) of an artist and that's something you can not do on Pandora... And don't get me wrong, I love Pandora."

Spotify,this app is great!,Celina,25-Jan-17,5,"I really like spotify,but there are times when my music stops playing and I have to close and open the app again. Other than that its a good app."
Spotify,useless since Spotify Connect feature updates,Bejan,25-Jan-15,1,"Was absolutely great. Now terrible and useless since the Spotify Connect forced updates. Used to be able to use Spotify app on my receiver by itself. Now HAVE TO use my phone to stream to the home theater receiver or other devices. What's the point of loading your app on my receiver if it will only work from my phone now (as of last week). It wouldn't recognize any devices - after fixing all the bugs and changing my device/receiver settings to get it to work, I realise they've turned a great app to an annoying, useless waste of space. I cancelled my Premium subscription and will uninstall the app. What a shame."

Spotify,Useless if you have an existing account,James Kahn,26-Sep-15,1,It will not let me log into my existing account.  It keeps telling me that I already have an account with that email address (duh) but does not let me log into it even though I tell it to 'log in' as opposed to 'create account.'  The effect is that this ap is broken for me and is useless.  Anyone from customer service reading this?  Respond and help me fix it.
Spotify,DON'T bother- they dictate your content:,Kindle Customer,28-Sep-15,1,"This will NOT give me the option to edit explicit trash content! Why should I be forced to listen to what Spotify sends? I wanted music that I could choose, but I might as well listen to the radio - radio doesn't play the explicit versions. Deleted Spotify and now use i(heart)radio.  There, I can edit my preferences."
Spotify,Piss poor,Amazon Customer,22-Mar-17,1,What's the point of paying PREMIUM SERVICE and getting none! No problems with PLAYLISTS NOT SHOWING UP AND WORKING. I took to YouTube since this issue hasn't been resolved in almost 3 weeks. Glad I switched to GooglePlay! #EffYouSpotify

Spotify,Google play is noticeably better.,E. Boss,19-Oct-16,2,"I'm originally on Google Play, which is great and easy to use. I switched to Spotify for the ease of using it with Alexa. However, Spotify is not as easy to use, frequently cuts songs off somewhere in the middle and just stops playing for no reason. I'm going back to Google Play. Google play is a better value, with YouTube red included in the subscription price."

I've already created 5 or so playlists.Bonus, if you pay for the premium service, you can use Spotify overseas with no restrictions.

Spotify,Unless you pay for it the free version is loaded ...,Walter Dobrzanski,24-Jul-16,1,Unless you pay for it the free version is loaded with commercials. Understand there's a cost to music but at least let people try to use it with a few less commercials.

Best of all, you can take your entire album collection with you anywhere you go without bringing a duffel bag to carry it in. COs are a thing of the past.

Spotify,I love this app! But...,Toni Char,17-Jul-15,4,"Was getting tired of Pandora so I hopped over to Spotify. Overall, I love it! I have the ability to choose the exact songs I want to listen to with the search feature and save them to my music, which, btw, is great. I can easily access songs, artists, and albums through the my music section, and you can also listen to a multitude of set playlists and radio stations. I have hundreds of songs which I can access anytime (as long as I have a WiFi connection) and I'm glad the music continues to play when the screen is off (I use the app on a FireHD)I do, however, have one reoccurring problem with the app which is quite annoying and the reason I am dropping the rating from five stars to four. If I am listening to music and using my kindle at the same time (it's most likely to happen while I'm on the web) the music will sometimes stop playing completely, and I have to go back to to the app and reselect the song. (Which, btw, counts as a &#34;skip&#34; and if you had been listening to the playlist for long enough, will trigger an add) Another similar problem involves the adds themselves: Sometimes an intro to an add will play (fyi I find these intros extremely annoying and useless) and the add itself will not play, even if I choose to play it. Other times the add will just stop playing mid-way through. On both of these occasions I cannot access any music, and the only way to get the app to work again is to dig deep into my options and force stop the program, which, when I reopen the app, I am gifted with another add.However, through all of the pet peeves and all of the glitches, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this app, and I encourage music enthusiasts to give it a try!"

Instead of playing in any chronological order, I have to shuffle my music, so it is bassicaly the same as any other bad music app that ive tried. In order to regain the abillity to listen to songs by clicking on them, I would have to pay for a premium subscription. Just another scam to get people to buy something."

Spotify,Coolio,lovie ken &lt;3,8-Aug-14,5,Spotify is AMAZINGLY AMAZING! I would say it is much better than Pandora and Iheart radio. You can search your favorite song and listen to it and find the almbum it was on. You can see all the music your favorite artist has and listen to all of their songs. You can like the songs and they will save them you can make your own albums and playlists. All the music is updated so they have the newest music thats still on the radio! They have a feature to this app like pandora where they can pick the music for you too!  You have LOTS MORE SKIPS than on Pandora and i heart. You can lots of stations and you can put it as background music! You can just click the song or station you want the exit out of the app and play subway surfers or do what ever you need you can turn it off and the music keeps playing! It helps save battery. You can also follow groups  and singers so you can see when they have new music out! I love spotify!  @loviemonsters!

Spotify,Tremendous!,S. Mondschein,25-Jun-16,5,"I wish I had known of this sooner.  I paid a lot to download Amazon Music not on Prime.  My college son told me about it and he just played a single album and he wasn't familiar with other features.  The radio option is great.  You choose an artist or a song and Spotify will develop a station of similar music. It's instant and doesn't need to learn your preferences like at Pandora,e.g.  My favorite genre of music (other than classical and Blues) is Celtic.  I was disappointed when I didn't see Celtic as one of the radio choices. Then I learned about the search feature and entered a Scottish band (The Tannahil Weavers) and up comes all of the Tannies'albums; All for free!  I've found out some albums that I didn't know existed.  I learned of groups that I didn't known of previously.  Again, all for free!!!  Amazing app."

Spotify,Best app available for music lover's,Dave Dixon,24-Aug-16,5,Absolutely one of the best apps I have downloaded. The music selection is immense. I took the free trial and plan to buy the monthly subscription. I am a big music fan. This gives me the ability to experience all genres.
Spotify,"Oh, so I have to pay to listen to my own music I already own?",A. H.,11-Sep-14,1,"BEST SCAM EVER!!!!  At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service.  Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN.  Where to begin...First, disclaimer:  I'm an audiophile.  I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies.  I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake.  So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.1.  Algorithm.  Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably.  All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock.  In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement.2. GUI.  Not horrible, but certainly not the best.  Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready.  Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!!  If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly.  Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.3. Paying to play owned music.  This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person.  While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly?????  Can someone make sense of this to me?  Why are people paying for this, again????  Ridiculous.  Developers:  The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!!  Otherwise, why even have this feature?  Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service.  Let the people play their owned music for free.4. Equalizer.  Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  Look up Poweramp.5. Cost.  So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good.  Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT.  Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price).  If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify."
Spotify,The things I like about spotify,cools,1-Nov-16,5,I like spotlight but I hate that u need premium and hit shuffle play and choses a random song
Spotify,nothing is free,Sharon E. Thunell,13-Jun-16,1,Free app but then you have to subscribe to the service
Spotify,One Star,Nicole Kunihisa,16-Jun-16,1,Cant get it to register or log in on my Kindle Fire.
Spotify,This app was amazing until....,bro,25-Oct-15,1,"This app was great. It has anything I could want to listen to, which is cool since I like pretty much everything. But now, since the new update doesn't allow you to pick your own songs, I can't listen to it anymore. I've tried using it, but it's frustrating trying to find a specific Misfits song or something, then suddenly, I get stuck on a band I didn't even want to listen to. Until Spotify let's me pick my own stuff again, I'm deleting it"
Spotify,Lost music is back.,clayton campbell,1-Aug-16,5,I really like that I can listen to music that I had  thought was gone forever.

Spotify,It's great but,Jayfeather,22-Dec-16,4,"There are A LOT of artists that they don't have. Missing albums for many of the artists that they do have (for many of the ones I follow and have in my playlists). The ads for their own company will blow out your eardrums. Don't know why they have to have them be so loud. It doesn't really change when you lower the volume on the device you have.The app cuts out shortly after I enter my browser or go to text. It forces me to remain on the app at all times. Can't even browse Facebook.Yeah, you should get it but be prepared for manual updates and a long list of problems."

Spotify,Lots of great playlists set up for working,AnnieK,16-Jan-16,5,"With the change of apple software to focus around their own services, using my enormous collection in iTunes match just got a whole less easy on my phone.  So, I looked at options and thought I'd try spotify. So far I really like it.  I love hearing new stuff and the play lists are great. They have a bunch of playlists focused on work and study. I work for myself and I find myself using their playlists every day. I have an all apple home and office, but I think I'll stick with spotify rather than apple music."
Spotify,_Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–_Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿ‘ŒI LOVE this app,Kindle Customer,26-Jan-17,5,I love this app! it gives you the oppurtunity to listen to any song you want without paying!
Spotify,Can't honestly review this app,B. Barnette,28-Aug-14,1,"It won't install on my Kindle Fire 1st gen. therefore, I can't give it a fair review. I downloaded AccuRadio and am satisfied with that so, to me, it's no big loss that Spotify won't install."
Spotify,the best?,Amazon Customer,20-Feb-17,5,its awesome you can listen to any type of music that you want
Spotify,Update is TERRIBLE.,Shadow Wolf,9-Nov-15,1,"Alright, so I was just going on spotify today and hit a song when the shuffle button like jumps (?) or something. So I click that and it doesn't even give me the song I chose. So I realize what they have done and so being all sneaky like, I create a playlist with one song on it, again, press shuffle, and what do I get? A SONG THAT ISN'T EVEN ON THERE!!!! 'Recommended' they call it. Wow spotify business people, that's all I have to say, just wow. (I WILL NEVER USE AGAIN UNTIL CHANGE)"
Spotify,seriously?,melissab,30-Jun-14,2,it was great at first but then it just turned out to suck because after a while i couldn't choose a song that I wanted to listen to unless i paid..
Spotify,This app is okay,Kindle Customer,3-Feb-17,3,This app is okay but I hate how it sucks on mobile and computer is hard to navigate.
Spotify,Unhappy customer,Thomas Gutman,19-Jun-14,1,I have lost the app on my Surface and it won't let me reload it.  Always love paying for something that is not being provided.
Spotify,Shame,Joseph Tefft,17-Jul-14,1,"Ok, so I want to listen to a specific song right, with good old spotify I can do that right, NOT! If you want to listen to a specific song, you have to get lucky enough for shuffle play to roll onto that song."
Spotify,Garbage,MilkmanDan,4-Jun-17,1,I downloaded this app twice now. The first time it said I wasn't connected to the internet. Second timer it wouldn't even log in. I sent an email to support and an waiting for a reply. Guess I need to find a better music app for my Kindle.
Spotify,LOVE IT,Kenneth D Cole Jr,16-Apr-17,5,I would recommended this to any one

Spotify,Niiiice,James Panton,15-Dec-16,5,"Great selection, if only it was hi-def..."
Spotify,Love it!,Amazon Customer,20-Jun-16,5,"This app works great for my general listening. I do have to search a little deeply for my more obscure songs, but overall I have been able to find what I want.  In the end, if you don't want the clutter of a million discs, this is a decent alternative if you pay for the subscription."
Spotify,could be clearer in terms,Amazon Customer,20-Jul-14,2,It would be an awesome app if 1) it had just normal play which is only included in the paid version. 2) starts off with a free 7 day trial for the premium version then the 30 day free day trial with an attached credit card.  Id recommend other music apps before this one.
Spotify,amazing music,Diana,19-Oct-17,5,Great app for music all your favorite songs right in a search bar and you don't have a limit listen to all your favorite songs get it

Spotify,Great browsing and easy to use,Amazon Customer,3-Jun-16,5,"Huge variety of music and pre-made / random playlist. Great browsing and easy to use. Love how it sync's up to almost all of my devices. Use it daily whether I'm listening to it on my Fire Tablet while reading, going jogging in the morning using it on my phone. Or even playing it on my ps4 through my T.V. while playing a game or just listening to it in the background. Offline playlist are nice for not eating up data with no wifi. Great Music App, its worth full membership for anyone who listens to music all the time in my opinion."
Spotify,Great app!,meyaya01,26-Oct-16,5,"This app is great, there are a few songs I couldn't find but overall its great. The commercials aren't all that bad. They rarely ever bother me"

Spotify,it was good before,realy fun. i recomend. ps dont wast all gold at begining. add rapter123,12-Sep-15,3,"I really love this app. No doubt about it. The thing is, though, they now have limited the features for non premium members. For example, you can't pick the song!!!! I find this super dumb, honestly. Also, you can't take ot off shuffle now. Its sorta dumb."
Spotify,Amazing,good game,29-Jan-17,5,This is the best app I could ever have on my kindle. I hope everyone will like it as much as I do. You can listen to any song you ever imagined.

Spotify,"Best Music App on Appstore, with One Minor Problem...",Amazon Customer,17-Mar-17,4,"This is by far the best app for listening to music. You can listen to anybody, anywhere, any time. It's incredible. One problem I have with the most recent update, however, is that I can't seem to be able to add anything to any of my playlists. I tap the ""add to playlist"" button and nothing happens. Please fix this as soon as possible."
Spotify,Irritating,kim chaffins,23-Apr-17,1,"Idk I only like Spotify because of how much music they have, that's an ok amount.. There's way to many ads and they're too long, this isn't TV, these aren't commercial break..  these ads don't need to be 4 mins long.. For a few 3 minute songs.. That's horrible, Spotify makes me wanna Kermit _Ÿê¸"
Spotify,amazing,Betty Huggett,5-Apr-16,5,"This music app is probably the best music app out there I lidsten to music 24/7 and this one actually stays on the person, band, or whatever instead of going to other things lile  Pandora does"
Spotify,Stops playing real often and hard to restart,P M Jones,19-Apr-16,1,"Stops playing and won't restart without turning off and usually have to wait several minutes before it will start again. Also won't play entire playlist - stops after each album and can't get it to continue same playlist. I always have to go to another playlist.  I am very disappointed in Spotify after reading the good reviews on the app. When I went to the help.section , I saw many others who were having the same problems I have with the player stopping so often and the responses from the help center indicate they have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it. If the problem is not corrected soon I will look for another music, etc app.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
Spotify,Amazing!,Amazing!,2-Apr-17,5,I love Spotify! I can listen to any song I want! I can listen to just one band without other bands playing with it! Spotify is the best!

Spotify,Replace Pandora?,Michelle S.,2-Oct-14,5,"I've only been on Spotify for a week now, but I think this may replace Pandora as my favorite music app.  Like Pandora, you create your own stations.  However, you can pick only the songs you want to hear right from the beginning.  It's not like you ""seed""the station with a song or artist, then watch it go into crazy directions.  Yes, it only shows a certain amount of skips, but if you create your own playlist with the songs you want, then it really isn't a big deal.  In addition, you do have to hear the occasional advertisement, but they are few and far between.The big difference to me is the cost of premium membership.  I believe Pandora charges about $30/year, while Spotify is $10/month.  That is a huge difference, however Spotify let's you not only listen without interruption, but you can skip to your heart's content, and listen to ALL your favorite songs.  AWESOME!Despite the advantages, I think I'll stick to the free version.  Just can't justify $120/year for music."
Spotify,Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music,Kindle Customer,24-Nov-15,5,"I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love.  It has way more than other subscription services I've tried.  The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another.  I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device.  I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials  Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient.  I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly  works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs?  When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."
Spotify,Great App For Kindle,becquilts,9-Nov-17,5,Best music app
Spotify,Works quite well,KENNETH S,8-Dec-16,3,Would give it 5 stars of you could turn on or off spirit connect as it causes my phone app to turn on spotify and use battery life
Spotify,"Great, but takes up too much space too fast",Terry,28-Feb-17,4,"I absolutely love this app. I've tried many others and in my opinion, this is the best.

Spotify,Very disappointed!,Lisa,1-Jan-15,1,It would not download on my Kindle - removed from device and tried reloading 3 or 4 times.  Very disappointed!
Spotify,Spotify as a User selectible music source - FREE version,"Tech Maven, CT",24-Jun-14,3,"Downloading to the Kindle Fire HD did not go well from the Spotify website.  Several attempts were necessary, possibly due to the screen size and location of data entry fields.  After installation I searched for and selected an album to listen to, but could not locate the play button; but a shuffle play button was available.  This started music but switched to a genre' format not allowing the songs from my selected album to be heard in order.  This may be fine at times for some users.  Odd that I did not see this limitation when downloaded to my WINDOWS 7 PC.  Like PANDORA, product adds will be heard after so many songs.  I have not tried the premium version of Spotify for the KINDLE FIRE / ANDROID / TABLET.  I may try downloading again to see if I missed something."
Spotify,Great !,Brulern,29-Apr-16,5,Very good and perfect for music

Spotify,Love it!,Amazon Customer,25-Jan-17,5,Love having my favorite songs nearby
Spotify,Spotify is the go-to music app,CJunie,14-Nov-16,5,"Spotify is the best go-to music app available.  I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed.  I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop.  I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data.  There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists,  which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder.  It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"
Spotify,multitasking fun,Trip1,16-Mar-17,5,Its great how you can pick your favorites then play them and listen while using other apps!
Spotify,Except choices of music.,Rick Koch,11-Dec-16,5,Everything I look for is here.
Spotify,Tashlins Review,David Tashlin,2-Feb-17,5,Awesome app for those who can't live without music!!
Spotify,they changed the app,dianne23USA,9-Nov-15,1,"Originally I loved the app, I could look up songs and listen to them to make sure I found the right version I was looking for, now when I search a song I can't listen to it at all until I add it to my play list and then I have to wait since the app only allows songs to be played in shuffle mode. I liked it much better when I could listen to the songs when I wanted to. I understand with a free app I should expect ads, I don't have a problem with that, but this shuffle mode and not being able to hear a song sample makes this app terrible. I will be looking for a new way to listen to my favorite songs."
Spotify,AMAZING,Mike Coleman,3-Feb-17,5,This is a wonderful appYou can pick any song you want you just type the songs name then it will show different artist who made a song with that title and I bet you 100 percent your song you want wiil pop up
Spotify,AMAZING APP YES THAT'S RIGHT I SAID AMAZING APP,amazing,3-Dec-16,5,"THIS APP IS AN AWESOME APP.YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ANYTIME YOU WANT UNLESS YOU HAVE WIFI ,BUT IF YOU GET SPOTIFIY PREMIUM YOU CAN LISTEN TO ANY SONG ANYTIME.I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING THIS APP OR YOU WILL RETREAT NOT GETTING IT."
Spotify,Love it but.....,my friend  had this game on her iPod and it was fun so now I'm getting it I had a lot of fun on her iPod and I think you will have fun to,7-Nov-14,1,I LOVE spotify it works awesomely on My android and my computer but on my kindle I'm lucky to get it to play one song it freezes up somtimes or it will tell me that the song is unavailable or like right now it's telling me that the song is playing but it's not no sound is coming out I really wish it would work I listen to it all the time with my phone but on my kindle I have to listen to Pandora please fix it
Spotify,In don't know if anyone will see this but....,I,7-Mar-17,3,"This app is half good and half bad,the good part about it is,it's music and its free,but its also bad because it wants you to buy premium for $9.00 or more,which some people dont have (me)so if you have the money than good,you'll like the app,but if you don't have the money than,I don't recommend getting it"
Spotify,Deleted -- free to download and the it,F M Hall,1-Jan-15,1,Deleted --  free to download and the it costs
Spotify,"was good, but then the update came",cheesy9901,2-Nov-15,1,"So I've had spotify for a few months now and I've loved every bit of it. A few days ago though it locked my songs and wouldn't let me click on them, and I could only press shuffle and only skip a certain number of songs. NOT COOL SPOTIFY. If you want to keep your users and keep your ratings high, please go back to the older version, everybody likes that one better. I'm going to delete my profile on Spotify and find a better app. (Spotify is turning into Pandora)"
Spotify,Awesome,zzxASSASINxzz,23-Jun-17,5,Awesome appeared
Spotify,ITS BETTER THAN ANYTHING!,victor uribe,5-Jun-17,5,I actually use spotify un my ps4 to hear music while gaming! This app is awesome because it also has playlists that have the mÃºsica u da music u want so u dont have to change the music everytime! ITS AWESOME!!! _Ÿ˜__Ÿ‘ç
Spotify,SUCKS!!!,rashaadtheamazing,26-Jun-14,1,"Never ever get this spotify for kindle fire hd because it won't let you press the song you want to play. You have to always press shuffle play! If you want a good app to play music, I suggest Pandora. Don't get spotify!"
Spotify,Highly Recommend It,Rebecca Kalbfleisch,10-Jul-16,5,I love spotify. It lets you enjoy music while doing other things and when you go on YouTube/internet or games it will automatically pause. You can pick your own songs by searching them and adding them to playlists and you can listen to other peoples playlists by looking them up. You should definitely check it out.
Spotify,Pretty good,Amazon Customer,28-Jun-17,3,I like it but it keeps putting on songs that aren't on my playlist
Spotify,Really?!,Alexander,6-Nov-15,1,"So this app used to be awesome, you could listen to whatever music you want, except there would be ads, which is fine because I didn't have premium. I still didn't want to get premium because I don't necessarily feel like paying 9 bucks a month just To listen to music. But recently they changed EVERYTHING!!! Now you can't listen to a freaking song without hitting &#34;shuffle play&#34; and after that it gives you other songs that you don't even like and it doesn't let you listen to your own songs. Now you can't skip either, and you can only listen to 1 freaking song on your playlist, then it starts playing the suggested songs which you can't skip. Seriously?! Now it'd just making it so you HAVE to upgrade! What's the freaking point anyway?! You can just use YouTube and make playlists. Don't get spotlight unless you get premium!"
Spotify,A Great Music App.,Barbara Frank,8-Jun-16,4,"I just recently discovered this app. It is great! You can choose any genre that you feel like listening to. You can change your mind; you can go from a station to just one artists songs. There is nothing stopping you from changing your mind as often as you like. Perhaps you'll start out with Taylor Swift, then switch to Blake Shelton, or maybe you just want to listen to RIFF. You can switch back and forth at any time. There is every kind of music you can think of ."
Spotify,Amazing,tom putman jr,21-Sep-16,5,This app is awesome
Spotify,Read This Before Getting App,Kathleen S.J. O'Connor,28-Jul-14,2,"If I could figure out how to get premium, I'd rate it 5 stars. Without premium, it's terrible. When you try to activate a premium feature, it just tells you that you can't activate it. It doesn't even tell you how to get premium, and I can't find the premium option anywhere. Unless you know how to get premium, do not get this app because it will be a waste of time."
Spotify,Good palylists.,KJ,3-May-16,5,Enjoy Spotify and the variety of music.
Spotify,Perfect gift for my grandson!,Colin Bingham,27-Jun-16,5,"He seemed disappointed at first, only downloading the app on his cellular phone, but then I told him about how we only had one very worn record of the Ink Spots, and that changed his tune. More specifically he changed the tune to the Ink Spots, as I told him all about the times I heard these songs durring my youth."
Spotify,Four Stars,jorge,22-Jul-16,4,Love this for work
Spotify,GREAT!!!,Randolph Nelson,26-Oct-17,5,I love the selections and the ease of downloading. The FREE version meets my needs.
Spotify,Rock-solid fan,Kindle Customer,3-Nov-16,5,"Anybody who loves music has to have Spotify. This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe.  I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle.  A seemingly endless supply of music.  I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for.  I'm not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there isn't."
Spotify,Fantastic!!!!!,maladym,4-Apr-16,5,I am so in love with Spotify! I can find anything I am in the mood for! Fantaso!!
Spotify,"Great on laptops, sucks mobile!",Stephanie Lowry,3-Jun-17,3,"Had the app on my phone, wouldn't let me play my playlists at all, only on shuffle play. Like it better on Kindle and on a laptop, no problems there."
Spotify,NO LONGER USING THIS APP!,Sam,29-Oct-15,1,"I used to use spotify all the time. Now since the new update came out I can only listen to music on shuffle. NOT only that but I created an account because it gave you an unlimited amount of skips, and you could choose the song you wanted. Now they are just like Pandora. Unless you pay of course. Seriously disappointed, I thought this music app would be different. I guess not."
Spotify,Don't tell spotify but this app works just like the desktop version and not the mobile version making ...,Joe,12-Oct-16,5,Don't tell spotify but this app works just like the desktop version and not the mobile version making this app f***ing amazing. Don't change how beautiful this is Spotify.
Spotify,Eureka! Where have you been all my life?,BruMan,5-Nov-15,4,"I was introduced to Spotify by my son and immediately fell in love with it. I have a very eclectic taste in music and Spotify allows me to sample, search and/or select whatever suits my fancy at the moment. I particularly like the ""Discover"" function which recommends albums/performers/selections based on my past selections, but does delve into areas I had not previously encountered. That route has introduced me to performers I had never heard of in the past (and my past is pretty extensive). Also Spotify has allowed me to compile personal playlists of albums and/or selections that I particularly like. I use only the free download so I do have to listen to short commercials now and again (and they are repetitious), but since most of my music listening is via radio, that is no biggie. I highly recommend Spotify to music listeners of any genre>"
Spotify,omg it's the best and nothing else is,Theresa Griego,18-Jul-17,5,It works well on a tablet so get it it may ask you for a email
Spotify,Almost got it.  So close.  Mostly perfect.,killermist,8-Feb-16,4,"Very ""manual transmission"" in design.  For some, this is a great thing.  You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save.  I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying,  It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own.  This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying.  This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya.  There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought.  This isn't a criticism of the app itself.  It can only do what it is programmed to do,  But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell.  In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever).  I can live with that."
Spotify,A great service up there with the rest of them.,Bobbo,2-Jul-17,5,Let's me listen to song I haven't heard in years. It's cheap to be able to listen to just about any song or group you can think of  and create your own play list.
Spotify,terrible,Herron123,19-Feb-17,1,This is stupid and you can get the premium!!!!!#this suck
Spotify,Nice Service,J. Morgan,22-Jun-14,5,"I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself. I notice the app plays short ads, where for some reason I don't if I use the web page on my PC, maybe because there is room on a full sized monitor to run visual ads."
Spotify,doesn't work on my samsung gio,mjvn,14-Jun-14,1,The app is not working on a samsung gio smartphone. The message is that it is not supported. Can't use it
Spotify,Spotify,Jolee the first,27-Jul-16,5,I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get this.  You don't even need premium (unless you want more songs).  This app is great for listing to a specific song any time you want.
Spotify,Great love it,Gleches a lot,8-May-17,1,I can't listen with out WiFi because ii don't have data._Ÿ˜•_Ÿ˜_
Spotify,Music,Cappuccino,7-Sep-17,5,"I love this music app, I can listen to my favorite songs any time I want."

Spotify,"Dear spotif,",Eric petersen,23-Jun-17,4,You guys need to add back Dr Dre's album the chronic. The chronic would have a lot of downloads and Spotify would be really popular and probably have more downloads. Or so-Eric PetersenPs- Add the chronic
Spotify,Spotify,Bigjer,5-May-16,5,Works great when others dont
Spotify,was awesome...,OmegaX,22-Nov-15,1,"It was a good music service until they made it like mobile where  you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want.  Especially sucks when you listen to bands who's albums are like books: meant to be listened to from beginning to end, not out of order."
Spotify,Listen to the whole album!,Gabriel J,27-Mar-16,4,"This is a great music app! I love how you can listen to any song on an album and download songs (premium) to listen to without using data! Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button isn't hit and it won't resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc"
Spotify,???????,summysmom,24-Nov-14,1,Was happy for one day with this app...loved it the it decided to only give me the option to shuffle there is no longer a play option for individual songs. I don't want to sit here and wait for the song I want to hear to randomly play!!
Spotify,Great app,J. Sanchez,14-Jul-17,4,Great music app. Love the weekly discovery feature and the daily mixes.
Spotify,Can't use it,Lorraine Powelczyk,30-Jul-16,1,I tried signing up to use this app and I can't it won't let me do Facebook sign up or email :( guess that was aa waste of data to download
Spotify,No hotbar changer.,Cool kid,7-Aug-16,4,It's great for people who have unlimited data.... My main issue is that there is no hotbar player for when the app is open. I don't enjoy having to go back from Silk to Spotify to skip a song.  P.S: I'm using a Gen 2 Kindle Fire that was purchased in 2012.
Spotify,very good,KATA,21-Mar-16,5,The Premium version is very good!

Spotify,Love it,Lover of music,28-Oct-17,5,I love the songs that they put on the app from TV shows\games
Spotify,Awesome,N Sherman,4-Apr-16,5,Great app all good music
Spotify,Its like free.,Charles Hamilton Sr.,4-Aug-14,2,"I tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you. Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice (which probably costs money) you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost.When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, ""we know you have to pay for cable, but we don't tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads.Pandora is the same.....don't want to pay, we interrupt your play. It's all about the money and getting more."
Spotify,From an extremely angry user,Justyce,25-Oct-15,1,"I used to love the Kindle Fire version. I liked how it was basically the same as the computer version. No harm was done. I was fine without premium. The ads didn't bother me too much. Then, the new update happened. Now its the exact same as the phone version. I have always hated the phone version for a reason. There is basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connects to wifi, but now I just don't want to use it. There was no harm in keeping this version the same as the computer. Profit isn't an excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you as a company are crippling artists' profit at the same time. I'd rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price is a lot more reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I'm really encouraging you to change it back because I guarantee that you've lost many users to this and you're just going to lose more. I used to recommend Spotify to people, but now my view has changed. Its just not worth it anymore, so I'll just spent my time warning people off of this half baked app. You're Welcome, Spotify"
Spotify,Perfect,Loverofthelight,27-Jul-17,5,"I love spotify, it lets me listen to all of my songs legit anywhere I go. It makes playlists for me judging by my music and I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Five stars for Spotify!!!"
Spotify,Was awesome,Teri B,13-Jun-16,3,This app sucks. When I installed it the app wouldn't respond. It was maybe the lack of internet in my house but the app is awful.
Spotify,"Worth it, free or premium",Cosmo Kepler,18-Feb-15,5,"Spotify has an amazing selection, no doubt. The ability to create your own playlists, surf from one related artist or group to another (in other words, discover new music economically) by listening to the entire track, and to listen offline (Premium only (it's a coded special file, so don't think you get to keep it permanently) is truly great for the listener. However, the artists are severely underpaid. Services like this one are a slap in the face for the creative geniuses that move you emotionally. If you want to do them justice, be more than a complacent consumer and tell Spotify that you demand more support to the artists they profit from. Hold Premium hostage! Only get the free version until they change their ways!"
Spotify,I love it,Zuly,17-Jun-16,5,Excellent!
Spotify,The best there is,Cynthia Dagnal-Myron,16-Jun-17,5,"I've been using Spotify for several years now, and I have to say, it's my streaming app of choice. First of all, you can find almost anything on it, from music to even things like guided meditation or audio books. So it's the first place I search when I hear about a new artist or song. Or if I'm looking for an old song or an artist I used to love but lost track of over the years. And lots of people, from celebrities to critics will post special playlists you can choose from as well. I'm constantly reading articles that send you to a new playlist worth checking out. I also love being able to use downloaded playlists offline if I'm driving or flying, too.The app itself is pretty foolproof, though sometimes searching can be a little bit tricky. And you still can't alphabetize your playlists, which gets messy. . Nothing else works as well or has so much to offer yet."
Spotify,Cannot Live Without This!,Margaret A Thurn,21-Jun-16,5,"There is nothing I can say about Spotify that hasn't been said a million times before. This program is simply amazing. For just over $10.00 a month I can listen to any song pretty much ever created. I get the new radio singles, new albums, singles from weird indie bands I've never heard of, customized playlists, Sunday playlists for when I want to chill, the ability to search by song, artist, or album and I can save anything I want to find it later. For how much music I listen to (every day, constantly, non-stop), I simply cannot exist without the variety and ease Spotify provides. If you don't have a membership, get one ASAP. This is how music playing should be! I have it installed on my computer, cellphone, and Kindle so I have access to it from literally anywhere. Please and thank you!"
Spotify,Only one complaint,13,9-Oct-16,4,I hate when I try to make a que and load albums together and it shows up on my currently playing album so I have to drag songs from current album from bottom to top
Spotify,The best free music sight,tim dowdell,28-Jun-17,5,Great selection of great music

Spotify,The BEST music app ever!,Spellbound,27-Jun-15,5,"THE best music app of all! I was a subscriber to a monthly music service for years. Then I found out about Spotify. I had several gigabytes of music files on my computer and in the cloud. When I found Spotify, I made the decisione to get rid of all that and save space on my hard drive.You don't actually BUY the music, so you can't burn CDs or make other copies, but you CAN have the app on all your devices, so the music goes with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system, so I can listen to what I want....and no commercials!  You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want...not 'sounds like' the music you like And the best part is that you can make your playlists available offline, so you don't have to have an Internet connection to listen to your music.Another nifty feature of Spotify is the ability to view the lyrics of what you're listening to if you want. All the information about the artist is also available if you want to know more about the artists you're listening to.And for those people who are devoted to social media, Spotify also allows you to connect with friends and see what they are listening to and you can make your playlists public as well. I don't use those features, but they are available.This is the app I use more than any other on my devices. I just love it."
Spotify,Great app.,Jeff S,14-May-16,5,Glad I downloaded it.
Spotify,Pretty Awesome,Stablegirl,11-May-17,4,"The music is great, they have near everything. Wish you didn't have to pay to play the immediate song you wanted to instead of putting it on shuffle. Otherwise, great app that you should totally get!!"
Spotify,Amazing,jamie,8-Dec-16,5,This music app is so much better than Pandora lol.
Spotify,and I have a favorite playlist on Spotify that I listen to each morning ...,Carol,12-Aug-16,5,"I use Spotifyt all the time, and I have a favorite playlist on Spotify that I listen to each morning when I read the paper.  Spotify doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of iTunes or Amazon Music; but the search feature is easy to use, and it's very easy to create and modify playlists.  I especially like the fact that it plays through my Amazon Echo."
Spotify,I like Spotify a lot...,Dwayne,18-Nov-16,4,"Spotify became my ""GO TO"" app for streaming music.  I like the variety and flexibility. I like Spotify best when it works with my devices.  It does NOT work on my Kindle Fire.  I have gone to the dev sight and they do not provide for feedback which would allow them to discreetly fix issues.  They do have a tab that says FEEDBACK but it is a goat rope.  The app works great on my Samsung devices but it does not work on Amazon devices. Go figure."
Spotify,yass.,Matthew D Williamson,2-Jun-16,5,"I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99Â¢!!! I love Spotify."
Spotify,Best music app,Anthony,14-Jul-17,5,Best music app
Spotify,Nice addition to my music listening,kapster,20-Jun-14,3,"I enjoy the different options offered me and in some cases a listing of songs hard to find elsewhere.  I've only been a sub subscriber for a few days and am continue exploring what Spotify has to offer.  The only regret I have at this point is that this service is not yet available on my windows phone, something I hope will change soon."
Spotify,Spotify Premium makes this the best source for music,KJ,30-Mar-15,5,"I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work!Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great."
Spotify,Great but I'm giving it four stars....,Amazon Customer,26-Jul-16,4,"Spotify is great! It is almost like Pandora only you can search and pick individual songs and make your own playlists. They don't have everything but they do have a lot. Also, the recordings for some of the songs are not good at all ( piano pieces are all I have heard so far with bad recording) but I don't know if Spotify controls that or not."
Spotify,We love Spotify. we have the family account and we ...,shina,3-Oct-16,5,We love Spotify.  we have the family account and we are all always on it.

Spotify,not using because of security warning,Silver Fox,30-Dec-14,1,"I downloaded this app from the Amazon app store for my Kindle Fire HDX. At first it worked fine but then when I accessed it, it displayed a dialog box which said: APP COMPATIBILITY:  Unfortunately, this app has not yet been updated to the latest compatibility or security standards.  We have notified the developer and asked them to provide an updated version of this app. If you have any questions please notify our customer support team using the help app .  Then it gave the options to either close or launch anyway.  Considering the broad array of permissions that this app requires in any event,I chose to close it and will not be using it until it is cleared by Amazon.

Spotify,For All Ages Teenage to Elderly: SPOTIFY,Thomas J Fallon,24-Dec-14,5,"Love the versatility!  Check this out.  I live in Tucson, AZ and have been Care-giving for my 81 y o Father for the past 9 years out of my home.  His health recently hit an all time low placing him into Home Hospice status.  My Sister (49 y o) who lives in Charlotte, NC contacted her two sons (18 & 22 y o - my Fathers Grandsons) requesting they put together a playlist for my Dad including his favorite recording artists including but not limited too Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, & Jethro Tull. They new this was a job to be done best by SPOTIFY.The Playlist was quickly assembled by the Grandsons, they e-mailed me (55 y o) my new created User Name & Password, I followed simple provided download directions. The Playlist appeared upon my Log-in I pressed Scramble Play, and I had one very happy, sick but smiling Father for the following 3.5 hours. Since yesterday he has enjoyed the mixed playlist 7 additional times and can't wait for tomorrow morning to come!Thank You Spotify!!!!!!!"
Spotify,SPOTIFY IS FANTASTC!!!!,Cindy Householder,30-Jan-17,5,"Spotify is absolutely wonderful. I am in my 60's and really hate being exposed to do much of the electronic things. But my daughter thought I should have this and I am so grateful that she did. I have had so much fun getting all the old songs on a playlist (yes, and some new songs). I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
Spotify,Spotify recovered my hacked account and deleted playlists,Draggon,11-Apr-17,5,"Well I have both Spotify and Pandora premiums.  Spotify to me is way better though for several reasons.One, Pandora tends to skip alot and then instead of just pausing the song a second or two till it re-connects, it jumps to the next song.  Gets rather annoying.  Spotify on the other hand will pause, and then in a couple of seconds continue on with the same song.Two, I can choose playlists and download them if I know I'm going to be in a place where connection isn't very good.  Pandora is good for suggesting songs based on your likes.  I often use Pandora for that reason alone.  But when it finds songs for me that I like, I add those songs to my Spotify playlists.Third, and for the kicker.  I haven't used Pandora customer service so I can't judge them.  But Spotify customer service is Aces.  I was looking for a phone number to call them - which they don't have I found out, but that's okay.  I used their contact form on their website and they contacted me back the very next day.  The problem I was having was that my account got hacked and PW changed.  Wouldn't have worried about it too much but I had my payment info, and of course playlists that I had taken lots of time to build.  They immediately locked my account to where no one could access it, and deleted any personal & payment info.  Then restored access to me.  Not only that, they recovered all my playlists that had been deleted by this jackass whoever he/she/it may be (psyilucas@gmail.com).Anyway, several emails back n' forth with a badass rep named Christian over at Spotify, and I'm back to fully operational status!"
Spotify,Love it!,mp216,29-Feb-16,5,"Love spotify. All my favorite songs and albums at my fingertips.  Really nothing bad to say about it. Its free and has ads but the ads dont bother me one ad after every few songs no big deal. Now it also lets you listen to one ad and have 30 minutes of uninterupted listening. I add my fave songs to playlists, organize playlists, and save entire albums. I just put my favorite playlist on shuffle and jam while im getting ready for work. It works great on my kindle fire.  Excellent app."
Spotify,Great appy,Shawn,6-Oct-16,4,"I would honestly give this platform five stars but, the adds are annoying. I don't want to upgrade lol. Great app though. They are always making good quality updates to music and over all stability of this app."
Spotify,Pretty good overall,Rick Sommerfeld,21-Jun-14,4,"I like that there is a huge amount of music available, that seems to make Spotify more likely to have the specific types I am interested in.  I also like being able to search and find entire CDs of music and put them into an easily accessible list.  Kind of like having CDs on my computer.  I do wish that there was info on each CD or artist, or the lyrics, the way that Pandora does."
Spotify,Only One Complaint,Kindle Customer,27-Aug-17,4,My only complaint is that you need to have a membership to pick the order that your songs play on a playlist.
Spotify,"Michael Richards review, PS it is the best app ever",Amazing,20-Apr-17,5,I love it. It is the best music app made. I just don't know how to get premium plz tell me how too
Spotify,"Try it, you'll love !!",Mrs. Mac,3-Nov-17,5,"I absolutely love Slotify. Not only can I create my own playlist of favorite music, but they put together suggested playlists based on my likes. I use Spotify every day to listen to music. Try it, you'll love it!"
Spotify,Newer user...so far so good,Renee E.,19-Apr-16,4,I really like spotify music app. Although I am relatively new to this app and will do a follow-up review once I have been using it longer. What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear!  Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it..
Spotify,Awesome service if you don't mind the subscription fee. Music choice is pretty great,Connor M.,22-Aug-17,4,"Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there's really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you won't find on the other. They're about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations (although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that's something you care about), hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they're pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I've found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you'd like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can't stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it's worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that."
Spotify,Terrible,Amazon Customer,24-Jun-17,2,This app will not let me start a playlist I can't even press the continue button to get started
Spotify,Music,xNinjaCat,6-Aug-16,4,"They have great music and most of my favorite songs, I recently figured out that they don't have all of the panic! at the disco songs, and not all of a lot of other bands songs, I think they should work on getting all of a bands songs and not just half of them. Be sides that it is a great app"
Spotify,itmis OK but_Ÿ˜_,Sara,28-Feb-17,5,it is OK_Ÿ˜_
Spotify,Best music app there is!,Keren Goheen,6-Sep-16,5,"To begin with, I discovered Spotify because I had a PS4 and Spotify apparently has some sort of partnership with Sony.  I created an account through PlayStation for free and used it a few times but didn't realize the extent of its capabilities.  I recently got myself a kindle fire, and have been using Spotify on it more than any other app!  Not only can you stream any song you can think of for free, you can also create and listen to custom playlists, stations (similar to Pandora), and even listen to podcasts and videos!  I use Spotify so much, and I would have to say its better than any other music app I've used by far.  If you don't mind the 30 second ad every 30 minutes, you can pay $10 a month for premium and also get lots of other features.  I would highly reccomend this app to anyone who loves music and wants it anywhere, anytime.  This app absolutely justifies 5 stars!"

Spotify,not working,ginger,4-Sep-14,1,"I downloaded the app originally and it worked,  but then it started leasing up so I reinstalled it but now it won't install on the kindle fire.  hopefully they can fix this bug."
Spotify,ERM MEH GERD SO AMAZING,Applez,2-Sep-16,5,Okay so I highly recommend this is you love music cause like you find all your Fav songs and make a playlist and just.. relax and listen to it all its awesome I read and listen to my playlists on spotify I can't even express how amazing this app is just... download it for yourself and find out!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!! :D also in. 16 so... If your a teen lookin for music and etc. This is soooooo for you!!! :3 :D
Spotify,Loved it from the moment it first came out!,Charlie R.,10-Jul-16,5,"I probably should've known that is was too good to be true.  For those of you who joined spotify early enough you may recall how similar in appearance the desktop app was when compared to itunes, so similar in fact, that you could easily have mistaken it for itunes, except all the music was free!  Free has a cost though and 10$ a month for premium unlimited (when the equivalent will only buy you 10 songs from itunes, which btw has a limited number of downloads before you have to REBUY IT AGAIN) out weighs the competition pretty heavily.Perhaps in a wise move, the Spotify management did away with the Apple itunes-esque design, and replaced it with pretty much the current design that we have today.  Unfortunately, the new design took a few steps backwards from its original functionality, certain key features seem to be missing or lacking, and I personally found the old design to be more aesthetically pleasing if not simply easier to navigate.Pros:-Free with ads, or 10$ monthly membership which is 1000% worth it!-Remarkably large volume of artists and music selection to satisfy the pickiest audiophiles.-Local syncing allows you to easily add any music from your personal collection on your PC onto your phone via wifi almost seamlessly.Cons:-Programming team behind the app grows progressively ""dummer"" with each update, by which I mean they have a tendency for gutting out small quality-of-life features (like controlling title size in the desktop app).-Local syncing may require some ""massaging"" to get working at times, if you're not particularly tech savvy this can be a real dilemma.-Will eat through your phones internal storage in no time, however my provider (Virgin Mobile) offers unlimited music streaming and I get good enough coverage to never worry about buffering.Conclusion:I'm very impressed with the quality of service I get from my 10$/mo premium and can't imagine living without it (throwback to the Limewire days anyone?).  Some of the prior updates smoothed out the layout, but at the cost of functionality in some minor areas, but not enough for me to knock down a star.  Having the ability to quickly and easily sync local mp3s to my phone without the same inclusive barriers that I've come to expect from Apple products feels like a God send!  5 out of 5, I highly recommend it!"
Spotify,Great,greg jones,2-Sep-17,5,Amazing app
Spotify,Good,Amazing Dotcom,16-Sep-17,5,Able to link current devices that has Spotify to use as a remote.
Spotify,Love it,Kindle Customer,20-Mar-17,5,Love the app. All of my music is on it!
Spotify,AMAZING APP,Slim Dunlap,4-Feb-16,5,"Literally nothing wrong with it. Not having premium is not bad at all--I can still listen to all the music spotify provides, if I have wifi. And there's even a bonus, maybe only for my specific kindle: even though I don't have premium, i'm still allowed to select songs I want to play when I want to play them, instead of just playing shuffle and having no control over what's playing all the time.Occasionally, ads come a few seconds before the song is over, which is a little disrupting, but it's not really a problem.Good work, Spotify, keep it up. :)"
Spotify,You will not be disapppointed!,Mrs. Davis,15-Feb-16,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Spotify. Even more so than Pandora. I purchased the commercial-free version and I use this app all the time, with ZERO COMPLAINTS! I get to pick my favorite songs and make my own playlists or I can like another's playlist or I can enjoy songs by only one artist-- the possibilities seem endless. Try the free version first and see if you like it, then upgrade-- that's what I did! :)My playlists are under LEISADAVIS.ERA - check it out, you might like them!"
Spotify,Incredible App,Â§ilverÂ¿Â§t@llion,29-Nov-16,5,"I have tried Pandora...  Jango...  Sound Cloud...  and quite a darn few other music apps...  but Spotify had everything I was looking for...  it is $10 ( ten ) for the premium version...  I do not buy the premium.  And it is still an incredible app...  I absolutely love music, and this app has everything a music lover needs...  Definitely a ""must have"" app."
Spotify,love it,Sk,23-Mar-16,4,"Could use a bit more variety with the ads. I don't mind ads, but I'd rather not hear the same ones over and over again. Lots of great music, and good playlists from Spotify."
Spotify,Amazing,xthewolfwitchx,19-Jun-17,5,I love the app! It's amazing! Doesn't have all the music i listen to but still. Haas almost all of them. Recently helps with music
Spotify,love it,MIKAYLA,23-Jul-16,5,Love it it is amazing
Spotify,A great way to find new and old music and add to my library,MOMSTER,23-May-16,4,"I finally got this app to work on my new phone!!  Previously I was unable to log-in and after repeated requests to reset my password, with the links never working, it seems there may have been some compatibility issue with my old phone.  I've been doing a lot of song/artist searches and this is a bit annoying since I can't immediately tell if a song is legit or a cover till I download it.  So a lot of deleting is going on.  I'm also finding that the search engine is poorly designed since I can input a name or title and I may or may not find what I'm looking for.  Very inconsistent.  But, that being said, I still give this 4 stars since it's a great way to find new and old music and add to my library."
Spotify,"AWESOME Music player!! Try it it's free,you can't go wrong with FREE",T.Ables,22-Sep-14,5,You should take a minute to try this you will love it! It's free and you can save your music for offline play also. You can find your songs and artists easily. The application is SO easy to use that you will really enjoy it. You don't have to do a million things to play music on this site. It's free so give it a try. Enjoy!  Thank you makers of SPOTIFY MUSIC !! You made this APP worth while.
Spotify,I like it.,Livi,25-Aug-17,4,"It's a pretty good app.  The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed.  It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity (to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps), and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again.  But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just ""I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists"", but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites, I couldn't find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like ""Lady of Shallot"", which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."
Spotify,LIT ALL DAY,Mikeesha Watts,19-Oct-17,5,I love Spotify so much. It feels me with joy. My fave playlists would be all the rap ones. I'm addicted to rap and I'm finding new music each and every day. When I'm having a bad day I just listen to music to drown my sorrow away. I definitely recommend spotify.
Spotify,Helped me find new amazing music,Shannon Stock,18-Jan-17,5,"Spotify is an amazing app if you are wanting to listen to music. You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! There's a tiny but. (haha) On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you don't know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it's not when there's one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it's helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite _Ÿ˜_"
Spotify,Reviewed today,Thomas Sadler,28-May-16,5,Nice selections
Spotify,love it,Amber,24-Feb-17,5,I love how I can listen to whatever song or artist I want and still have radio stations that at are based on what I listen too.
Spotify,Good Overall,usaqwerty,24-Dec-14,4,"Very good app with good browsing and discovery of music. The only issue that prevents me from giving 5 stars is that every so often it has trouble opening on the galaxy S5. I have to repeatedly open and close it, and sometimes wait a couple of minutes, for it to work."
Spotify,Spotify Best Music App!,Chloe Taylor,22-Jun-16,5,"As my title indicates, Spotify is the best when it comes to ease of use, as well as, and most importantly, when it comes to the quantity and quality of the music! Also, it is well worth it, but not mandatory, to pay the paltry fee and ditch the commercials. :) Love my Spotify!"
Spotify,"WHY, Amazon, won't you support your own device?",Costello,5-Sep-14,1,"I was excited after a long time of waiting to get a legit version of Spotify on my 1st gen Fire. I had to watch two new models in the line release, and now that Spotify is finally on the Amazon store, you won't support my Fire in running it!? I bought the friggin extended warranty too! How much money do I have to give you before you will uphold your end of the deal?!"
Spotify,Spotify Premium is the best way to stream music!,Jennifer Lee Egan,1-Aug-17,5,"I absolutely love Spotify and I use it all the time. I have Spotify Premium and it definitely worth paying for it. I use it everyday some day and almost all hours of the day. I also love he offline mode so that if your not on wifi you can still listen to the playlist you choose. With Spotify premium, there's not ads, unlimited skips and you can listen to anything you want to. It's definitely the best source for music streaming. Thanks Spotify! _Ÿ˜„_Ÿ‘è_Ÿè»"
Spotify,Needs Fixing,Amazon Customer,16-Oct-16,3,"I'm not able to use the play/pause functionality unless I'm directly in the app, hopefully this gets fixed with the next update."
Spotify,Why Did I Wait So Long,picky buyer,6-Jun-17,5,"My sons have been evangelizing about Spotify Premium for a while now, so I tried the free look and am hooked. I'll play an album and when it's done it will start playing music based on what I've played in the past. I must say their algorithms are pretty good and I've learned about a few new artists along the way. Well worth it."
Spotify,Spotify is the music app you NEED to have!,Jaxon Williams,25-Dec-15,5,"Spotify is the music app you NEED to have! Whether you use the free version or purchase Spotify premium, you will find hours upon hours of enjoyment with this app. You use Facebook to create an account, after which you can share your favorite tracks and playlists with friends. You can add any song you want to by saving the artist, album, or individual track. The music library is seemingly endless. I have found music from everywhere including the Philippines to Germany. I use the free version, which means I am limited to online use and using shuffle when I play playlists or artists. I will encounter ads every 30 minutes, after which I will have 30 minutes of ad-free music. By purchasing Spotify premium, you can save your playlists offline with no ads, higher quality music, and not having to listen on shuffle mode."
Spotify,I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!,carlos lorduy,20-Jul-14,5,"I think SPOTIFY is the best music app in the world!!! Why should I get this though you ask, 1. Its toatally free 2. You can get any song in the whole wide world for free 3. Its partly a socail media so you can get followers and stuff based on how much other people like your playlists and songs 4.You can even listen to your playlist and songs offline!!! 5. Also there is remixs,explicit versions, clean versions, and all of that too! So if you still don't believe me try it for you self for FRRREEEEEE!!!!!!!"

Spotify,Best Music App with Minor Issues,A. Cowher,7-Sep-15,4,"This is a really great Spotify app for Kindle Fire that is even better than the web app in my opinion.  You can easily access all of your options, and it plays clearly with very few issues.  One of the issues is that if you have to pause your song for a little while, you often times come back to the app saying you are not connected online.  I always check and am always connected. Clicking back until it kicks you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track.  Also sometimes when playing for a long period of time, you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffering and will not play.  I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song.  Other than that, I really like the app, and I find it to be the best out of all of the music apps (Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc.) out there."
Spotify,I can listen to music without purchasing it!,Abby Thomason,20-Mar-17,5,I love spotify because you can create your own playlist and you can listen to any music without purchasing it! Totally worth 5 stars!
Spotify,95% perfect! Except......,Ashley Brown,4-Aug-17,4,"I love everything about this app except for the simple fact that you can't play songs that u want to. I don't want to feel like the only way I can listen to a certain song that I want at the moment is that I HAVE to purchase the premium thing. I can understand that I would have to pay to download the songs, but to pick my own songs that I would like to listen to at the moment? That to me doesn't really seem right but I won't argue. Anyways, other than that, this app is amazing! (If anyone who does work behind this app, please update this and if possible make it so that we can choose our songs for free pls? Thanks~)"
Spotify,Amazing!!!!!!!!,Sky,6-Aug-17,5,"If you love a lot of songs and music, well this is the app for you!!!! It has so many songs. You can make ur own music playlist. It has some ads but they barley are on. Lol I suck at reviews. This also has radio. This is so much better than iHeartRadio_Ÿ˜_"
Spotify,Better than Pandora for sure,Astrid,20-Jan-16,5,"I love my spotify.  I have the free version.  I use it primarily when I'm working on my computer for music background or working out or working.  When you get to listen to your own personal selection of music, you don't have to worry about turning the channel, or hoping the next song is better.  They are all great songs, because it's your selection.  You can make different lists too, which makes it even more customized for what you are doing and what you want to listen to while your are doing it."
Spotify,Heaven for music addicts!,Meg Murray O'Keefe,2-May-17,5,"I can safely say that Spotify is the greatest, most joy-inducing invention of the 21st century.  I play music CONSTANTLY and Spotify can satisfy your every need with a mere click of a button, from Yo-Yo Ma and Mozart to 60s folk to modern electronica... The premium version is the best $10 a month I can possibly spend.  I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew... I use this gloriois app, new releases to me within minutes of release, and member all the weeks waiting for CDs from the BMG CD club!!! Modern marvel..."
Spotify,Relevant Solution for Life,MartyO,5-Dec-14,5,"Spotify is the solution for keeping your music selection relevant throughtout you life. Allowing you a full musical experience in a very cost effective manner. Music is the background of life keeping us present. Let me tell you a quick story. When in my car with a nephew one afternoon I realized my music collection was so stale and outdated. An indicator part of me was stuck in the past and holding on to something. Like many of us, I had spent a lot of money on everything from albums, 8 track, cassetts and CD over the years. At some point that investment switched from buying to storing music. The cost of holding on to the past prevented me from experience the present. And takes me back to the beginning of my story. So my solution to keeping life's background revelation in a cost effective manner is SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allows me to stream Spotify thought out the home"
Spotify,ROCK O bye  SPOTIFY!!!,fun4491,14-Oct-14,4,"Been using SPOTIFY for about 2 1/2 years and has always been able to satisfy the only reason I could not give 5 stars is that it seems to lack one thing that a number of other streams provide and that is a sleep timer and/or alarm clock feature ...other than that it's really good at laying out the new releases discovery tracks, mood plays, had used a competitor for a bit of time and was happy with there genre/ subgenre UI layout but after some research on SPOTIFY found that it has its own app that does lay out those choices.  So yeah may not give a wake up call or drift me off into a good slumber but would not choose it over any other....."
Spotify,Spotify Makes Me a Happy Camper :),ALH,14-Feb-17,5,"As someone who grew up wth lovers of music in a house with music always playing, two sngers and even  a tour manager for a great Indie/Folk musician in my family, I am so blessed to have been around every kind of music from every decade of the 20th and now 21st centuries (plus a love of Classical, film scores, Broadway standards, you name it.Spotify helps me access pretty much anything I am in the mood for. I have never searched for an artist or song and not found it in Spotify. It really is the coolest site.The App is great too, very easy to use, and I even discover new music here.Try it, I can't think of an problems or even disappointments, and  have been a happy fan, especially in the lastt few years. IF you tried Spotify when it first was popping up on Facebook, and found it confusing (i did, but can't remember why, it has been been a while),  I encourage you to give it another go. Everything is organized and user friendly, you can follow friends &learn about new - or just new to you- songs.My 78 year old Dad LOVES this App (he has a vinyl collection to die for,  early Rock from the people who truly were the pioneers. And Spotify has it, they have the 1970s stuff my Mom digs and new discoveries she hears in radio.I only wish my music LOVING Grandmothers were around still, they both loved music so much.So yep, 5 stars from me, and my adventures into more than 80s music :( Which they also do have. _Ÿ˜€ the best ""Time Machine"") Sorry to gush, but I'm really happy to write about something positive!

Spotify,"Sorry Spotify, you lost me!",Valerie,24-Jul-17,1,"I've been using Spotify for a few years, both the free version and subscription. I stopped the subscription because it was too expensive for the amount of time I actually used it, and now that I am back to the free version, I cannot play any songs I want when I use it on my phone app. It's always on shuffle, basically no control over my music and the ads are so annoying. I got the same skin disease ad all day over and over while sitting at my work computer - SO EMBARASSING. I downloaded VIBBIDI (free) and it is WAY better, I can actually choose the songs I want to listen to."
Spotify,"Best music app for streaming, discovery, and sharing",Kim,10-Jul-14,5,"Spotify is my favorite music app by far. It's great for playing almost anything you can think of. You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also search playlists that other users have created, or make your own.  The discovery features are pretty ample. Spotify makes it's own suggestions, and there are several add-ons (last.fm, Hype Machine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone Recommends, etc.) that also give great suggestions based on your listening habits or what's new and popular.  The social element is also fun. You can follow other users (including artists) and see what they're listening to, and share songs and playlists.  I pay for Spotify premium because I like having offline access and no ads!"

Spotify,spotify new user,Doughboy,28-Dec-14,5,Well for the longest I would use this app in the free version. On PC its the best program for me even in free version because you create unlimited playlists and skip as many times as you want only there was commercials. I recently upgraded to premium and it's 100x better. No more commercials and some features I don't use. I forgot to mention spotify on mobile only allows several skips a day. With premium it acts just like on the pc. No commercials unlimited skips and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose. I personally liked the free version over Pandora for the simple fact that I could make a playlist on Spotify and play it on my phone but would be on random or &#34;shuffle&#34;. And now I just like the fact that I can now fully listen to my music and not be annoyed with  commercials or no more skips allowed.

Spotify,Spotify is great but has some crazy-making glitches.,feralblue,17-Jul-16,4,"i like Spotify a lot - BUT - it has a lot of glitches.  When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on  - if i stay on it a second too long.  THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before.  This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!!  The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love.  It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's.  i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or  solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately.  i am frustrated over that.Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)"

Spotify,Great but...,Terra Starr,12-Jun-15,4,"I got premium a month or so ago and loved the freedoms that came with it. I bought that month with a card from the store. Now I wish to get another month, but I don't have a credit card and was trying to see if I didn't have to go to the store for a card again. Five stars if it would allow me to pay through Amazon.The free trial is alright. You can get a bunch of music and create playlists. An ad comes up about every half hour. Not too shabby."
Spotify,Incredibly Useful!,Taylor,19-Oct-17,5,"With Spotify, I've been able to customize my listening more than I ever could with Pandora- Creating playlists, listening to your favorite album of that one artist you love, so much more! It aswell has similar channels in some parts to what you would find on Pandora, so trust me when I say you won't be missing much of anything!"
Spotify,Secret Overcharges - Horrible Customer Service,Boxer007,11-Aug-17,1,"First of all, I've been a loyal premium user (student subscription) for the last two years. I thoroughly enjoyed the desktop and mobile versions, as well the other features provided - offline streaming, Discover station etc.However, beware of Spotify's horrible customer service and other difficulties when using internationally. First, I noticed that I was being charged a full price subscription ($9.99) for several months despite still being a student. The automated email response by Spotify's customer service stated that the student subscription is only valid for 12 months/academic year, and must afterwards be manually renewed. There was NO prior warning for this and I was charged $30 more, without the possibility of a refund - DESPITE still being a student. I even suggested that the extra charges be put towards future subscription payments and they refused.Second, good luck using Spotify conveniently abroad. If you wish to change your method of payment while abroad, your credit card MUST match the country you are in - which is incredibly inconvenient for most users and those who frequently travel. Spotify does not offer advance-payments (i.e. 3 months or more) so this problem is difficult to avoid. Customer service is horrendously slow (24+ hours to receive an automated email response) and in most cases my question was not even addressed properly."
Spotify,Amazing,moe,15-Sep-17,5,"I can listen to lit music and make a playlist, but you have two upgrade for downloading music."
Spotify,... using Spotify for years now and I am in love with it,Leia Signs,13-Jul-17,5,"I have been using Spotify for years now and I am in love with it. I used to have problems trying to find all kinds of free music downloader apps and apps like pandora... but Spotify really has it all! It is your one stop shop for endless playback, new music, radio options, while being able to follow artists and your friends. I highly recommend this app if you are an avid music listener, you like finding random music, or for just about anyone else out there. It has something for all!!!"
Spotify,I love this!,nicki,13-Sep-16,5,"I love this!!! I can find almost any song I like and play it whenever I want. So much better that Pandora where you cannot pick the exact song you want. And it's free!!! I just can't listen without internet without paying. That's fine by me. I let this play whenever I'm cleaning. I can skip songs if I'm not in the mood for them, but usually I just let my song list play. I picked the songs, so I like every song that comes up"
Spotify,Best App For Music,4evahazeleyez,16-Mar-17,5,"I love this app so much. I am a premium member and I can create and play my playlists anytime I want. This is the best app I have found yet, and I've tried many! The only downside for me is I couldn't find 2 songs and I'm not sure why. I'm not taking a star off for it tho."
Spotify,Get It,Paul,8-Feb-17,4,"Spotify is new to me and I have found it to be pretty cool.  A nice feature being that you can keep it playing while reading or other apps. are going on your Kindle. Great streaming service and a good way to check out new albums before you purchase them on Amazon or other places.  It is a free app. , so give it a shot!  I find the search feature best."
Spotify,The best choice for music streaming,Kenneth L Muller,9-Nov-16,5,"There are many apps that allow users â€œfreeâ€ù access to music but it usually comes at the price of extensive advertisement interruptions or limited streaming capabilities. The Spotify app combines inexpensive buy-in with user-friendly layout to make it worth spending a few dollars a month on a music streaming app.In terms of a free app, the Spotify app limits users in that they cannot stream music without Wi-Fi. Once the user decides to pay for the Premium version of the application, these restrictions no longer apply and the app becomes the perfect suite for music discovery and library curating. For this review, I will be assessing Premium Spotify and not the free version of the app.The cost for students is very affordable with a discount bringing the original price of $9.99 down to $5.99. Although for some this may seem pricey, access to unlimited music means one only needs to add 5 songs a month to reach the price per song threshold that surpasses the value of the iTunes store which charges $1.29 per song. Many will add more than this amount in new music a month and will find that it is much more affordable than other means of purchasing music and is available without Wi-Fi and without using oneâ€™s data plan if saved to a specific playlist.This is more efficient, affordable, and legal than the means available for music streaming in the past. Free applications such as Limewire or its predecessor Frostwire were based on a system of file sharing that was shaky in its legality and often led to viruses being downloaded onto oneâ€™s computer. Many of the songs were incompatible file types for iTunes which made it difficult to access music on cell phones or media players. Spotify makes it easy to access your music library by allowing integration with iTunes libraries and having cross-platform apps that can be installed on a variety of devices.Spotify has over 30 million songs in its catalog and adds around 20,000 songs each day. One still may not be able to find songs that may be readily available on applications like Soundcloud. In comparison to apps like Pandora Spotify also falls short because often times the music it chooses to match songs of your choice are either by the same artist, or are characteristically exactly the same as the selected song and offer no variety. Looking for new music often falls upon the user to search and sort through the vast catalog of music on their own.All in all, Spotify remains my top choice for music streaming based purely on its low price and extensive catalog. Supplementing Spotify with free apps like Soundcloud and Pandora work well to complement Spotify in the areas where it falls a little short. Even with its shortcomings, the price, music catalog, user friendly layout, and compatibility with multiple devices make it the best choice for music streaming."
Spotify,Caters to musical taste,Mayra,10-Oct-17,5,"Music streaming websites offer the basic functions for easily accessing music, and out of  all of them, Spotify is one of the top competitors. The company goes above and beyond to cater to their clientsâ€™ musical needs by providing a wide selection of music, creating personalized playlists and notifying them of recent activities for their favorite artists. These advantages not only allow a user to discover new music based on their personal taste but also gives a quick shortcut to make it convenient for them. With the regular updates on artists recent activities users are able to listen to their newest tracks as soon as they are released or even have the opportunity to attend their latest show. As far as the search goes for the best compatibility between a music streaming service and music lovers, Spotify is a great service to try out, especially since they do offer free trials."
Spotify,Pretty good ^~^,Anonymous,12-May-17,4,"Would be nice to be able to have some offline tracks for free, but I understand why you can't do that. Works really well on Kindle Fire."

Spotify,Spotify beats Pandora,Meglis family,23-Feb-15,5,"Trust me on this one,This is the best music app I ever seen! & you can even make a song playlist and make it so people can look at them and follow the playlist then....YOU! (but that is only when if you make it public)And if your wondering what my profile is it's optical music and my old account is vikame anyways it has alot of song and I mean ALOT!!! You can find over 1,000,000 records/tracks and I'm not lying!You can also share your playlist and you can even save songs that you like by touching a song and then touch the plus sign.There is a lot of different music genres like Rap,Country,Deep Web,R&B, And Emo but emo sucks so dont listen to it or you will kill yourself but I highly Recommend this app.SPOTIFY IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN PANDORA!!"
Spotify,beyond expectations,Snowy Chloe,4-Apr-15,5,"I found this app on a vacation in France, after Pandora told me I couldn't use out in Europe. Unlike leading music apps/radios, you can create playlists, listen to already made playlists, or, my favorite, just search up particular songs, artists, or genres. Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one. It works great, but like all others, needs Wi-Fi or cell service. But it's still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!"
Spotify,More music at your fingertips,E. Yasi,18-Dec-14,5,"If you like the ~1 million track library Prime Music now has you should try out Spotify and its ~30 million tracks of music. It's like trying to drink from a fire hose, but eventually you'll learn how to explore and you'll never have to listen to just a small library of purchased tracks again!The interface is well designed and easy to use. It's almost exactly like it's Android version so no real Fire tablet/phone extras, but still well done. Be sure to go to settings and bump up streaming quality as high as you can with your data plan."
Spotify,Spotify is an awesome music program.,Amazon Customer,13-Oct-16,5,I will never go to another music program. Spotify has me for life wether I have the free program or if I'm fortunate enough to have Premium Spotify has me for life.

Spotify,The best,elecia spann,12-Nov-17,5,"It's better than Pandora to me at least... I love this app. Before, i did have a couple of problems; but most likely because I didn't know how to use it. But now I really love this app!!"
Spotify,SPOT ON  ALL PROs,Mstihkal Safyr,26-Aug-16,5,"Spotify (free version) has all Pros: choice of music, ease of use, dependabilty, availability of current + vintage genres & songs, transportability (downloads across multiple platforms)...to name a few.Cons: none that I have found & at this rate will be surprised if I do.I would get it again & do recommend it to all my music lovers.Thank YOU Spotify for being awesome!"
Spotify,Love this app,dr sunshine,4-Oct-17,5,"Love this app.  I have tried different music apps, but this is user friendly in my book, and can download, so can be offline and listen anywhere.  Has a  huge selection of music, which is great, since I listen a lot to german music, and no problem finding it."
Spotify,Tried again a few weeks back and I'm overjoyed. Now I can stream all my Kansas,FarmWife,28-Nov-14,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for fixing the Spotify app!I uploaded it as soon as I got my Kindle Fire back in January. Unfortunately it didn't work at all. I couldn't access my playlists, it wouldn't play more than one song, and it continued to freeze until I finally deleted it.Tried again a few weeks back and I'm overjoyed. Now I can stream all my Kansas, Vanilla Ice, Neil Diamond, and Miranda Lambert happily."
Spotify,Bee's Knees,Fi!thy Rich,4-Aug-17,5,"This is not only the best music app on the market, it could very well be the best app on the market.Premium is absolutely worth it.As a musician, I cannot live without this.What are you waiting for, download this and improve your life."
Spotify,SPOTIFY IS FANTASTIC,Michael Gilliepie,31-Jul-14,5,"If there were more stars, I would give to SPOTIFY.  Masterworks Broadway got me started with their playlists. I like being able to select an artist, listen to an album, switch to radio for Spotify to make suggestions based on what I was listening to. The fee audio is excellent. I haven't tried the premium, yet. Only because I really like the music ads. I've been introduced to a number of good artists from the ads. Besides, the ads aren't that frequent and only 30 seconds long. Once over, you back listening to your music. I  really can not say e enough good things about SPOTIFY. I've been recommending it to my friends on Facebook."
Spotify,Why waste time with anything else?,Church Watkins IV,8-Oct-17,5,"Spotify is incredible in every way imaginable... Lol, how often does one feel like the they're personally cared about naturally? Spotify gives me that feeling.... Having a premium account is one of the few monthly payments ive ever had in life that I've not had one regret about, and I got three months for free lmbo.Keep it up Spotify... You've got my musical heart... (Discover weekly slays pandora's lame attempts)"
Spotify,Almost five stars,Amazon Customer,14-Aug-17,4,"Spotify is a fantastic service with great music content. I have used it for about 2-3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads (which are always funny and interesting) the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug, and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review."
Spotify,"EVERY KIND OF MUSIC I COULD EVER WANT, WHENEVER I WANT!",lulublu22,7-Apr-16,4,"I love Spotify, any song or CD I want to &#34;own&#34; is mine, just by searching for it and then saving it.  It will always be there.  Same goes with any othe playlists I create.  I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal.  I think $9.99 a month is a little over priced, since I could get Prime with all that comes with it for under $100.  But  I will want to download eventually, so when I'm not so broke, I'll be investing in it."
Spotify,I love Spotify! I have their premium service and I ...,Bryan Shearer,8-Aug-17,5,"I love Spotify! I have their premium service and I can listen to music offline, I don't have any commercials and I can skip around as much as I like. I don't even need to try any of the other streaming services because Spotify has exactly what I need."
Spotify,Would have liked to give four stars ...,Meralyn Swensen,10-Sep-16,4,"I really would have given four stars to this had there been no ads.  This is exactly the reason why I went from ""regular"" TV to Roku.  I'm sick of the commercials. I like that you are able to create playlists on Spotify so have been having fun with that.  Also the ""browse"" feature is nice if you know who the artist is but forget the name of the song.  All in all, it's pretty good and I would recommend to all music lovers."
Spotify,Great,Diane Young,8-Aug-17,5,I love this app. I can pick all of the songs i love unlike pandora that picks songs based on what you like.
Spotify,Just the Best Music App Ever!,Zoev,15-Oct-17,5,"I created a calm jazz playlist last night, and fell asleep to it.  Beautiful!!  My son and daughter used Spotify to create the playlist for their sister's wedding.  We linked it to our Church's PA and voila!  Beautiful wedding.  Great product!"
Spotify,"this is the best music app I've ever used, except for a bug...",I Heart Godzilla,10-Sep-15,4,The bug that has recently happened to me and I'm not sure if it's happened to anyone else or not but I got home one day and was about to start listening to five finger death punch... but it wouldn't let me play any music unless it was on shuffle or I had spotify premium... I'm able to listen to music now because I'm using the 7 days free feature of premium... if they could fix that I'm sure a lot of people would be happier.
Spotify,"Thank you for the music, the song I'm singing...",Yesterdaisy,8-Aug-17,5,"Amazing. Has just about, very nearly every song and album ever recorded. Allows you to create and organize playlists of any type and length. Just phenomenal. Can't live without it, in all honesty! ;) Works well on computer, phone, and tablet."
Spotify,samsung mini 4 sleep machine,K. Denyse,22-Aug-15,5,"Spotify sleeping music choices are amazing, and have a better selection than all of the sound machines I have ever owned. The other music and video shorts are great as well. The navigation setup is easy, and it all interfaces well with my Samsung, whi h is unusual. I am not inthe iworld, and often let down by the &#34;made for android&#34; apps. This was NOT  disappointment. :)"
Spotify,I enjoy the wide variety of music that is available on ...,Christine Hall,12-Jun-17,5,I enjoy the wide variety of music that is available on Spotify. However I do not care for all of the extra phone that they call recommended. When I make a playlist I want it to play those songs not whatever it wants that they think is similar to those songs.
Spotify,Wonderful,Francis A  Dumkwu,12-Jul-17,5,I love this app...I get to listen to my favorite music
Spotify,Great concept with lots of freedom of choice in what you listen to.,LSAnderson40,8-Aug-17,5,"The great thing about Spotify is that you can play it on multiple devices, create playlists, easily find artists you like, or listen to curations / playlists put together by others. One of the best players around if you are an audiophile."
Spotify,"Ok, too expensive for Pro",BlessedOne777,14-Nov-14,3,"Like most of these type of apps the free version is great as long as you have Wi-Fi, but I live in the rurals and am often in areas wIth no connection. Then the app is useless, as well as at work, which is a government secured Wi-Fi, again useless. If I want to use offline I have to pay $10 per month, that's $120 a year. I'm already paying for Prime and I get free movies, t.v., books, and shipping as well as the music for $99 a year. So, why would I pay for this or anyone for that matter?"
Spotify,thanks creaters,don't get bros,6-Dec-16,5,Thank you for the app huge thank you now all I gotta say isLETS GET IT
Spotify,I've had this for so long,Makaila Jade Marshall,26-Oct-15,5,"I have had this for so long and it is amazing. I'm pretty sure everyone likes music so GET THIS! Free songs. If you get spotify premium you can listen ANYWHERE. Premium is only 10 bucks a month! For FREE SONGS! AMZING APP. LOVE IT!!!!!!! I would choose it over any music app other than Pandora they are both in first place. Cause with Pandora, I can find new songs to put on spotify!!! I also really recommend Pandora to spiritual lovers. ;&#62;"
Spotify,Love my Spotify!,js1,18-Jul-17,5,I have been a Spotify premium customer for several years. I love the ability to download albums or songs and play them back without using any data on my phone. Radio stations give you access to similar music to your favorite groups. Best $9.99 I spend monthly!!
Spotify,Awesome music whenever,Gilly Vandagrff,18-Jul-17,5,I love it!! Get to listen to all my music whenever and wherever I want
Spotify,love it but....  Review was by my daughter.  I have not used the app.,J. Thomas,30-Jul-15,5,I love this app but the new update makes the colors look bad they should go back but it is more efficient I guess. but you have to have wifi or you have to pay like 3.00 a month or something. but it's nice for if you have wifi. although the adds get annoying but I guess they have to make money somehow I mean they have to keep going an  it's not like other apps there are song  for all types of music New and old you just have to search.
Spotify,I'll stick with Rhapsody.,Islander,28-Oct-17,2,"I prefer Rhapsody, where the available songs are pretty much the same, but the menus are much better organized and the privacy options seem more private, where Spotify seems designed to encourage you to make your online music experience more public.  Although you can use Spotify for free if you don't mind the ads, while Rhapsody doesn't offer a free version beyond an initial trial period."
Spotify,I'd give it 5 easily please read description.,Philicia,17-Nov-16,3,I love this app and I'd give it 5 easily. Except for the last 6 hours or so I've been unable to use it. Claims its experiencing problems. Ive even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Started when my WiFi cut out.  I don't know what to do but I hope it clears up soon. I'm on a fire tablet and I'm NOT the most tech savy. Is anyone else experiencing this? I love that it creates radio stations based on your tastes. I love making playlists of what I like. And the service is free on my cell phone companies data plan. So all in all this app is awesome. Ive enjoyed its use faithfully for a long while. I only wished it had a alarm or a sleep thing on it. That'd be my only suggestion.
Spotify,Best music streaming service,B. Healy,4-Sep-16,5,"Best streaming service yet.  Like that I can play full albums from bands.  Pandora isn't even in the same category... I like to chose what I'm listening to, and sometimes even want to hear a specific song... imagine that.  Spotify does that, and also has a huge number of 'radio' and playlists available if you don't feel like choosing everything."
Spotify,AWESOME MUSIC APP!!!!!!!!,Clint Landry,29-Nov-16,5,I really like this app and at the moment I am looking at christmas playlists and it is awesome I found some really good ones you should also go on and get several playlists before you start listening bc when I first got it I was listening to the same music over and over again and forgot that I can look for other music! REALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
Spotify,LOVE IT,AmandaBelle,27-Mar-17,5,"I just love it! Beats all other streaming music providers I've tried. I don't mind paying for the quality I get. Especially since I can download my many, many playlists and always have my jams without using my data when in a bad service area or no wifi access."
Spotify,it's a pretty good app,4 stars,26-Feb-17,4,It's a pretty good app I just wish that I could look up a song with the lyrics instead of just the title cause sometimes you can forget the title

Spotify,Likes and dislikes don't ever save or change anything,natalie,29-Oct-15,3,"I'm actually really annoyed that I keep having to thumbs down the same exact songs every couple of days. It only saves about 5 songs that I've thumbs-up or down.  I'm so over hearing Adel.It's also a major bummer that it saves the thumbs down when it's an accident, and there's no way to correct it.The screen when listening to a station on the computer is odd. Way too busy.  I'd rather it looked like it does when I'm on my phone; simple with the album artwork, artist and song title and time elapsed on song."
Spotify,AWSOME!_Ÿ_†,Gregory D.,31-May-17,5,"Spotify let's me go quickly to all my favorite songs and artists. You can create playlists that you can easily get to. You can't listen to music on the go with connection but, you can simply download it on Spotify to let you listen. I enjoy skating and dancing to Spotify. It's simply a great app you must get it."
Spotify,Same Great Design as Spotify on the Internet,Connor Andreasen,20-May-17,5,"I'm glad I can access Spotify on my Fire Tablet, I used to listen to it all the time at my old job. The quality is just like using it on a web browser, maybe with a few more ads here and there but nothing to complain about."
Spotify,great app,Mrs. A. A. Soukup,11-Sep-16,5,"It is a great app.  Has great tunes.  And if you pay the subscription  fee you have as many skips as you like, no commercials and you can download tunes, albums and playlists.  They have a wide variety of albums ."
Spotify,I love Spotify!!!!,Kindle Customer,7-Aug-16,5,"I love Spotify Music. You can pick the tunes you like, unlike Pandora. I just have the free kind, but I am going to pony up to premium so I can listen offline too. Try it, you've got nothing to lose and great music to listen to."
Spotify,App,lovebug,17-Jul-17,5,Love it all I have to say it's amazing
Spotify,Spotify is great. And it's for everyone.,CTNewman,8-Jan-15,5,"Spotify is absolutely amazing. I got tired of my other music apps fast. I was constantly buying songs that I regretted within a few days of listening. But with Spotify, there's plenty of music to choose from and content for everyone. And I loved it so much without premium, but premium is even better. Not only can you skip songs, but you have a bunch of good music available at your fingertips. Get this app, I'd recommend it to anyone, because it suits everyone."
Spotify,Streams smoothly and offers a great selection of bands,Ben A,12-Jul-16,4,"Works well!  Offers offline capabilities. Streams smoothly and offers a great selection of bands, albums and songs to chose from... Just waiting for FREE connect to my Roku.Come out with THAT and you'll get 5 stars from me"
Spotify,Needs updated!,Mark Grago,1-Sep-17,2,"It's quite slow until it 'warms up'! They really need to perform an update on this! It takes a while for your songs, playlists and albums to download and are ready to be played. Amazon apps are not up to MAJOR tasks!"
Spotify,YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!,James J. Farrell IV,30-Nov-15,5,"The very best music appI've ever used! Remember when you listened to exactly what you wanted? I love searching for the perfect song, or that album I haven't heard since I was a teenager. Then there are the times I just select one of countless compilations/artist/playlist and enjoy. The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"
Spotify,AWESOME!,A. Robinson,6-Apr-15,5,"Spotify has revolutionized the exposure to music in my life. I have virtually unlimited access to the music of this world here, can make my own mixes and listen to it on ALL my devices. Perhaps my favorite feature is the recommendations based on what I typically listen to. I have found several artists that I adore and probably would have never known about had not it been for Spotify. Thank you thank you thank you!"
Spotify,Love it so far,Stasey Tackett,23-Nov-14,4,"After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)"
Spotify,So far I love it better than any other music app I have ...,Michael David Carroll,13-Aug-17,5,So far I love it better than any other music app I have downloaded more freedom to pick the bands I love using the free app right now probably worn upgrade still a great app highly recommend
Spotify,Give it time and you will love it,Give it a few days,16-Aug-15,5,Why is spotify better then all of the other music apps? Keep in mind just like every other music app if you want unlimited anything you have to pay a price. Spotify is 99 cents for the first 3 months and then 99 cents for each additional month(cheapest out of them all)â—èoffline listingâ—èmake your own play listsâ—èunlimited skipsâ—èshare play lists with friendsâ—ègood suggestions but not alot (it's not annoyingâ—è if the Playlist says g-eazy they are actually going to play g-eazy. Not iggy isalias.â—èMultiple playlistsâ—èwith premium you can look up a whole library of music by search word (ex: country hits or Katy perry) and you can look through a already made Playlist or albums upon albums of music and you can play whatever you choose.Personally I was a Pandora person but a friend forced me to use it for a week and once you build up your Playlist with the music you like you will forget about Pandora or whatever you currently use. Also spotify graciously gives you a week free of premium use which will help you build your Playlist (although if you want to add a song to your Playlist you can just look it up spacificallly and hit the 3 dots on the right and hit the plus)So my overall advice for this app is try it out for a few days do the free trial and enjoy. You don't need premium to enjoy this app. Ads are reasonable not annoying
Spotify,"ALMOST perfect, BUT!",Dewey R. Myers,29-Jun-15,3,"Very comprehensive app for listening to most all of your favorite artists. The 'free' version works well, with commercials at decent intervals. Sound quality is very good on my Kindle Fire HD, Not the same for PC. Music rarely plays without hesitation and pauses. The premium version has a real plus, off-line listening. That is albums can be downloaded to a phone or tablet and enjoyed without WI-FI or airtime. I understand that music downloads are not transferable to a PC library or other memory. If the $9.99/ mo. premium service is cancelled, so are the downloads. As much as I like Spotfy, it has a real drawback in that the music sampled or listened to stays in a history that loads every time you activate. There is no way to delete music that you don't want to keep. That is annoying and will quickly consume memory on a phone or tablet. So close to perfect, but NOT."
Spotify,Superior app,Bridget Phoenix,8-Jan-16,5,"This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate  I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."
Spotify,Best app for music playing especially with student discount.,The Reviewer Pro,8-Jun-16,5,"Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me."
Spotify,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon ...",Steven Rossellini & Daughters,20-Apr-16,5,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The ""loudness"" is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."
Spotify,The Best Music Player!,Krystal,21-Apr-16,5,"Love Spotify more than any other music player thing out there. It's also way less expensive than other players and I can listen to pretty much anything I want, anytime I want. I love that and I don't have to listen to it in a station or anything like that. I can make my own playlists, which I love even more. I just can't say enough good things about this player. I love it so much!"
Spotify,Great for Music Lovers (Better For Those Subscribed to Spotify Premium!),Alexander Tsui,30-Nov-14,4,"Alongside with the Spotify Premium service ($10/mo.), this app compliments to the smart music lover who subscribes to the Spotify Premium service who loves to take his/her music on the go with synchronisation features for offline play for playlists. I listen to music using Spotify over other music players on my device and my playlists customised with a lot of songs on it have been downloaded so that I can just bring my phone and go listen in my car or just while I'm out there.Great for the music listener and best for those who are also subscribed to Spotify Premium!"

Spotify,THE BEST APP FOR MUSIC STREAMINGâù_,Breanne,16-Jun-17,5,"I love this app for music. You can make playlists with your favorite songs so they are easy to find and you don't even need to buy premium. You can play any song and they constantly update their songs and podcasts. It is easy to use and great if music is your life, like me. _Ÿ˜_"

Spotify,Great for music however there are some problems with it.,Looser97457,27-Jan-16,5,"Overall it is an amazing program. I would say that it is the best of its kind.  The most annoying part of it for me is that I think that they play more advertisements than necessary. I know the advertisements are in part to support all of us who listen for free, but it still seems like they play more than they need too.  Usually I use it on my kindle and this brings me to my biggest problem with it. If you have the program open in the background while reading sometimes the music will just stop after the advertisement plays.  Then use have to open Spotify back up and restart the player this can be incredibly annoying.  Sometimes i will have to do it every 10 minutes.  Now that i gave the bad I will let you in on the good.  Spotify has an incredible library of music to listen to and it spans across all genres.  To go even further though they have full discography's of all sorts of Indie/Underground bands that you may have never heard of.  Spotify is a great program and I truly believe that any music fan would love it so give it a try.  Now i know that this review may seem negative, but I just want to add its only program I will use for music like this.  I wanted to give it 4 in a half stars but since i couldn't I gave it 5 because it is way closer to 5 stars than 4. Please give it a try!"
Spotify,I use it every day,Billy B,10-Jun-17,5,I am probably not your typical Spotify user.  My taste in music is eclectic and focused on classical music.  With Spotify I can find the music I want and suggested playlists for my mood and occasion.  It is well worth the money.
Spotify,I just love my spotify,txbest,7-May-17,5,I am so glad I decided to get spotify.  It is a great addition to my music collection.  I just love it.
Spotify,"Good concept, continued weak execution",Dread,12-Aug-17,2,"Spotty continues to have weak assed limits on downloads and songs you can save. Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."
Spotify,It's pretty awesome!! _Ÿ˜_,mark j. zamora,5-Sep-17,5,"This app is super cool, the only thing that I don't really like about it is that if you have a kindle when ur on a road trip or something, and there's no WiFi, Spotify won't work and u can't playt any songs! \: But other that that this app is amazing!! It loads quick and has any type of song, and it picks songs for you based on what u listen to!! ((:"
Spotify,pc app,NECKLESS,25-Jun-14,5,"I dont like the Kindle Fire app, because the only thing i can do is listen to music in shuffle. So i tried pc version and it's absolutely baller good, you can listen to music every way you want and when you want. Shuffle, repeat or normally. I recommend this for PC (using Windows 7 dont know how world for Mac users)"
Spotify,Spotify is my jam!!!,Christopher Barrett,7-Nov-17,5,"This is currently my favorite app in existence.  Worth the monthly fee for all the music.  Instead of buying a CD per month, I get access to 30 million songs.  Win!"
Spotify,this is such a joy to listen too,Pen Name,11-Aug-17,5,this is such a joy to listen too.  I love how I can make my own station playlist but that they have a playlist of the week as well based off what I like to listen to.
Spotify,Great source of music.,Michelle Dalton,24-Sep-17,5,An amazing way to listen to music.
Spotify,Great!,Amazon Customer,9-Mar-17,5,"Spirit is AWESOME! On the computer. On your phone you are very limited in what you do. Like, you can not choose the song you want. You can only push shuffle play. And some times it chooses a different song that is in your playlist. A positive it is will warn you that the song is explicit. Very nice. Refined it highly because every single song is on it."
Spotify,It is like having an MP3 with all the music you can possibly think of. AMAZING service.,Phyllis Conger,9-Jun-17,5,This app works exactly like the desktop version and allows you to do everthing that you would with the pc version of the software. The offline function works like it should. I would remcomend this app to anybody that needs the spotify app to be abble to login to there spotify acount.

Spotify,would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour,H Ong,23-Mar-17,1,"A few months ago, I subscribed my daughter to Spotify Premium, taking advantage of a $0.99-for-3-month deal. Everthing went through on the website. Spotify then decided that my daughter was not eligible for the deal just because I paid with the same credit card as my own Spotify Premium account. And without telling me, Spotify charges my daughter the full price of AUD11.99 per month for 3 months. I contacted Spotify and they will only offer one month's refund as a ""one-off courtesy"". So, Spotify charged me without my authorisation; would only offer a part refund and make it sounds like they doing me a big favour. So, I told Spotify: give me full refund or else don't bother!Be very careful of these Spotify deals - they are unscrupulous."

Spotify,"Beautiful, but hard to find lesser songs.",M.Weidenhamer,28-Sep-14,4,"This app is incredible, and I highly recommend getting Premium as well. For 10 dollars a month you never need to buy another song again.That being said, I was heartbroken because I could not find my favorite song of all time: ""Starlight"" by Don Diablo and Matt Nash. This crushed me enough to give it a four star review. If you're into ultra-obscure music like me, this might not be the app for you. Give it a try, though. It's free!"

Spotify,Good FREE service,DBosse,12-Jul-17,3,great FREE service.  I withheld two stars as they don't offer any contemporary Christian music selections.  GREAT 70's music available!  The commercials are a bit annoying but for free can put up with them.  I didn't like it well enough to upgrade to the paid version just to get rid of the commercials.

I just keep discovering more on Spotify.  Love it!"
Spotify,"Ok ,so ...",copycat,13-Sep-15,3,"This app has been the top music player up until the newest update , and I would have rated it 5 stars until this update changed my mind very much . You see, everything is mostly the same , except your playlists . It used to be that you could go through your playlist and pick any song you were in the mood for.Now , you have to shuffle your playlist until it comes to the song you want , which is very confusing and difficult , especially if you have quite a few songs on one playlist. I just think that it was perfect before the update , without glitches and very few adds, but this update upset me very much . I expected a lot more from you spotify ."

Spotify,Music you actually want to hear! Great App!,Maria a.,26-Jan-15,5,"I love hearing music, whether I'm relaxing at home or working out,The problem with other music apps:1. You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)With Spotify!1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)!4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it!(You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner!  Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)"
Spotify,good app,Eres Hrris,16-May-17,5,This is the best music app you can have.  If you actually pay for it.  You can use it for free just like Pandora so its still good to those who do not want to pay.  I cant think of any set backs.

Spotify,FANTASTIC,TMS,30-Sep-14,5,What a fantastic app!!! I love everything about jt. I opted for the premium version and the selections and sound quality are 5 star!!!! I also have a headphone amp I connect and the sound quality is superb! I'm listening through Beyerdynamic DT 880's. These have VERY high resistance (ohms) and normally could not be driven by a smart phone(these headphones retail for $550) u can't believe the sound with Spotify ' s equalizer and my homemade amp and the Beyerdynamics!!!???#!#?
Spotify,RECOMMENDED,Michael Richter,28-Dec-16,5,This app is the best music app ever. If you get premium you can skip songs and listen without internet!!! This app is really recommend and you should try it. You could also log in into two devices and connect them and it's amazing. It's ok if you don't have premium cause everything will be free but you have a limit of skipping songs and you would need internet. There are over 1 million songs and it's AWESOME
Spotify,"Great app, questionable ads",Angela Hamele,2-Aug-15,5,"Spotify is wonderful, what would I do without it?  I use it in my art classroom while students work, and I listen to it while I work in my studio.  My only complaint is ads, I just wish they were a bit more edited for content as people of all ages listen to Spotify.  I had to stop using it for a while in class because there were Trojan ads on every hour, I really didn't want parent complaints."
Spotify,Works... nicely,pzuidema,11-Sep-15,5,"What is there to say? Spotify on the Amazon Kindle Fire simply works. And it works as it should be. No problems, no hiccups. I love the way to use it as a remote when playing Spotify also on my computer or television. But most of all, it just has my music where I want it. And this app is simple to use, responsive.It should not trying to do more than that - which is what makes it a great app for me."
Spotify,more like 2. 5,Amazon Customer,9-Nov-17,3,"It doesn't deserve 3 stars, more like 2.5.  Spotify is great for free.  You get what you pay for.  There is an advertisement before the play list is executed and after the second song.  I have several playlists created but for some reason after about 4 songs Spotify inserts artists I never heard of.  Looses internet connection a lot.  Like I said, you get what you pay for."

Spotify,The Mountaintop of Music Apps!,Chris del Valle,26-Jan-17,5,"This is my favorite music app.  From the Your Daily Mix to providing your list of favorite songs of 2016, the app is intutive and valuable.

Spotify,The Service of a New Age.,Christian Hughes,4-Jul-17,4,"I was using this service in its early days when it's had a pretty okay music library and didn't shove Spotify Premium down your throat ever other song.

You can listen to what you want when you want."
Spotify,Find your Faves with Spotify and then BUY THEIR ALBUMS!,Gordon Beesley,25-Sep-17,5,"Great for listening to a whole album!  If you are from the 90s generation or earlier, you remember the significance of the cadence of songs and the intended flow of music.  I find my new bands with Pandora, and establish my favorites with Spotify.  After that,  I DOWNLOAD THE REAL ALBUM!  Music is important, so pay the artist."
Spotify,Yassss I luv it,Patty the Reviewer,5-May-17,5,"I love Spotify actually. Its easy to use, has cute designs and very easy to find new music. You can even create play lists which is cool. The ONLY problem I have with it is that sometimes it says ""Wait 30 min for the next ad"" and then next song I play there's and Ad. But beside that first world problem, Its great!"
Spotify,Things to Improve,Jessica,18-Feb-16,2,"Spotify can be great if on Android devices it didn't pause 10 seconds before the song was over for a few seconds and then continue to play! Also, when you listen to the ad for 30 million minutes of ad free minute I always get 2-4 adds before my 39 minutes are over!"
Spotify,"Greated Music station, from around the world. any song you like, any artist you like.",Ingeborg Coffman,2-Aug-15,5,"Being from Europe and like German, Italian and French music.

Spotify,Nice app ... paid version okay for Classical Music,Amazon Customer,27-Jun-17,3,"I'm a classical music enthusiast and hate most music apps for their inability to treat multi-movment classical works in their entirety. At least the paid version of spotify let's me turn off ""shuffle"" so I can play whole albums in proper track sequence.

Spotify,Almost like commercial radio with the exception of obnoxious disc jockeys.,Rancho DeLuxe,30-Dec-16,3,"It's really obvious Spotify wants you to upgrade to premium, and they certainly make it known ( and make it known, and make it known...ad nauseum)  On the other hand, it's NOT like Pandora:  When you ""OK Google"" an artist, you GET that artist, and not song after song of someone's subjective opinion of what you ALSO might like."
Spotify,Amazing music app,Adam M. Raver,26-Oct-16,5,"Spotify is my favorite music app. the monthly fee is minimal considering the massive music library you get access to. new music consistently added, list features allow you to save you favorites in a detailed way."

Spotify,The app is significantly worse than the website,Some dude,30-May-17,2,"The app is significantly worse than the website.  It will not let you select and play an album; it looks like it allows you to play an album on shuffle, but even that is deceptive, as it will include music that is not part of the album."
Spotify,Okay,Amazon Customer,10-Aug-17,3,I guess it is okay for people who are looking for this type of app but it doesn't fit my needs so that why I only gave it three stars.
Spotify,great radio app,Rockstarmom!!,20-Feb-17,5,I absolutely love this APP. I downloaded right to my home screen so I have easy access to get to it faster . Great tutorials to teach you how to use this app and very easy to use and find out what the title of a song on the radio is.[...]â€_. Many Thanks!I would recommend this product to friends and family.
Spotify,Easy to find your fav artists,Deborah Benson,3-Nov-17,5,Having trouble importing my music on my kindle fire from iPad. Gave up and downloaded Spotify. Easy to find your fav artists.
Spotify,Great subscription service!,Jane,28-May-17,5,Been a pro user for a couple of years and I've never been more satisfied! Having music with me wherever I go (even no service thanks to offline mode) has been a life saver. Highly recommend!
Spotify,Internet Connection,KellyB22,9-Dec-14,4,"The app is great, and I love how you can follow peoples, make your own playlists, have all of your songs in one place.... I love it. However, for some reason my Spotify has a glitch and it won't work for hours or even days at a time! It says I don't have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this isn't. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it's a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you."
Spotify,Five stars!,Melania,18-Aug-15,5,"I have always loved Spotify! It's free and offers the best quality music you can hear, because it only has the album versions. And even if there's advertisements here and there I don't mind, but I honestly plan on getting premium soon so I can have music offline too. Aside from the great music, and easy to use interface, you can also make your own personal playlists to listen to anytime you want! And if making a playlist isn't your thing, you can start a radio station based on one song or artist, and Spotify will play you songs that are similar or related. All in all it is the best free app out there for music. I highly recommend Spotify to anyone!"
Spotify,Excellent App to listen to your favorite tunes on!!,Gloria ,15-May-17,5,"I used to have Pandora and Spotify is so much better.  It's nice to be able to select a specific song to play, Pandora doesn't allow you that option.  And so far Spotify allows me to skip as many songs as I want if I don't want to hear what they suggest. Pandora only allows you to skip so many songs at a time,  then it makes you wait to skip a song after you have met your quota for songs you don't like."
Spotify,Spotify,Kindle Customer,8-Aug-17,5,Spotify is a really good music app. If you get premium you can go advertisement-free. You can create your own playlists and make them public or private. You can even access other playlists created by the Spotify team or other users. The best part is that you czmanb access full music albums from your favorite artists for free. I 100% guarantee that this app will fulfil your needs.
Spotify,BETTER THAN PANDORA AND I HEART RADIO!!,Kindle Customer,9-Dec-14,5,"So much more enjoyable than those other music apps! I like how it's laid out and easy to use. I can find any song and it immediately plays; no waiting for ads! And I love creating my own playlists to fit my mood. If I'm feeling lazy, there's tons of prepared playlists to choose from. Like, those to fit my mood or one to get me pumped up to start doing the laundry.I'm sticking with Spotify and don't use any other music app."

Spotify,No More Facebook Log-in.,Vermeer Brown,5-Jun-16,4,"I love Spotify. I detest being forced to employ Facebook to log in. Myriad attempts, through Spotify, to correct the problem have failed. The software offered to eliminate Facebook adamantly 'thinks' my desire is to change my password, part of the process, but not the goal."
Spotify,Best music app ever,Rs2sroke,23-Aug-17,5,"Best music app ever! I finally got it, I wish I would have done it a long time ago. I purchased the family plan, so we can all enjoy it."
Spotify,Haven't Yet Started,Cali W. Donaldson,17-Jul-17,5,"I haven't started this app yet, but I'm really excited to do so. I mainly got it to listen to music by Ninety9Lives, if possible. So I can't properly rate Spotify, so I just gave it 5 stars."

Spotify,Love it!,Paula S.,8-Oct-17,5,I use Spotify all the time. Love it!
Spotify,Amazing,Amarina Le Stellar,1-Aug-14,5,"Spotify is an absolutely mind blowing app. I have the version with minimal skips and shuffle play, but my brother has an update where it is completely free and there are unlimited skips, back-skipping, songs on demand, and you can (still free) download the music to your device to listen without WiFi. He also has a kindle fire HD, and we played no money for his. It's a fantastic app, worth even five dollars, but it's an even better deal because it's completely FREE!!!!!!"
Spotify,Good overall. Ads too loud.,Lost Gecko,31-Oct-17,4,"Overall, I like the app.  Wide choice of music.  It plays entire tracks, with noisy ads in between occasional tracks.  The ads are louder than the muic, and not controllable.  Of course, if I were to pay for a premium subscription, the ads would go away."
Spotify,"Hear the music you enjoy, quick, easy and fast!",susan jones,5-Aug-17,5,"I can access the music I enjoy quickly.  Just type the group or song, and it comes right up.  Really nice."
Spotify,Absolutely Amazing......for the most part,Megan,13-Sep-15,5,"I use this app ALL the time, and I love it. But, now I have only one problem. My Spotify updated, and now I have to listen to everything on shuffle. Now, I don't have premium, so when I skip lots of songs, there are lots of ads. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls & Boys (or any song)? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle! Now, aside from this minor difficulty, the app is the best thing. Great work Spotify!"
Spotify,Spotify Recommendations,Renee .M. Gardner,23-Jun-17,5,"I LOVE spotify it has everything for you, it recommends music, to what you've been listening to. You can find different genres of music, if you are wanting to listen to rock, they (spotify) have multiple playlists of that genre, if you like Indie music they have it, pop, rap, love music, acoustics, etc. they have it all. Spotify is the app for you. Spotify also has a 7 day FREE trial. I definitely recommend this to you."
Spotify,THE BEST,Lue,29-May-17,5,"Before Spotify, I'd gone through so many perilous journeys to download free music . But Spotify makes it so easy, and I don't even mind the 10 bucks a month!! The music is unlimited and every song is on there ! No ads, extra fees, and all your favorite songs at your fingertips?? Uhh yes please  !!!"
Spotify,Only got better over the years.,Hamza Benamar,28-Aug-17,5,Has been getting better and better over the years.Great plan for family at the right price.Synching offline to be able to listen to music in planes: works well and offline storage remains on SD card. Not a problem anymore.

Spotify,Great music application!,Arizona Derek,21-Dec-16,5,"Spotify is a great music streaming app, I actually prefer it to Pandora for the reason that I have more control over exactly what artists play on my stations. I would highly recommend this app!"
Spotify,Great for a tablet,Amazon Customer,13-Mar-17,5,"Spotify is great on tablets and computers because you can play whatever you want just for ads, but on a phone its still good but not free for everything (which is understandable. I love it more than amazon music because it has a larger variety of songs AND talk shows."
Spotify,literally to the point where it is painful. I understand the need to have ads for ...,Jacob Meyer,11-Sep-17,4,"I am enjoying the free version of Spotify and considering the premium version.  If I could express one concern/issue, it is the fact that every time an ad comes on the volume is dramatically increased....literally to the point where it is painful.  I understand the need to have ads for the free version, and I'd be OK with a slight increase in the volume, but what I experience for a volume increase with each ad is far beyond what is required or what reasonable customers should be asked to tolerate.  Any chance you can throttle it back into the reasonable range?"
Spotify,i like it but...,Amazon Customer,9-Aug-14,4,"I am still in the the ""honeymoon phase"" , having fun picking out the wide variety of  music I love. There isn't anything that I haven't found and some I forgot about.I had not read any reviews prior to picking them out, my aim was to listen as I drive, I see I need premium. I don't want to pay but do I really think its going to be free? Nothing ever really is but someone has to get paid for all this. For now I'll enjoy it as is."
Spotify,Love it!,Kathy S,23-Aug-17,5,I listen to my 70's tunes all day at the office with my run bluetooth speaker in my desk drawer! No need to my playlist Hadassah  just pick your station!

Spotify,SPOTIFY is Number 1!!!!!,Dinah Nielsen,4-Feb-15,5,"The Spotify premium subscription is well worth $10.67 a month, can't live without Spotify, I use it everyday at work and when working out.  So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized.  Spotify is the new ITunes, in my opinion.**"
Spotify,epic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Kindle Customer,16-Jan-16,5,It has the best songs in the universe plus the songs are free!All you do is search for a song/singer and add it to your play list!!

Spotify,Music lover,Sonia Deckert,23-Dec-16,5,"I've been with Spotify since 2014 and turned Pandora fans into Spotify lovers. However this past spring, I thought hmmmm let's check out Google Play's music app,  and after 2 months returned to Spotify. Your app, and the new lay out and updated features are AWESOME! _Ÿ™‹ Your team has always been helpful when I had ?'s and promptly with responses. I'll continue to be a long time listener and supporter of Spotify!!! Thank you"
Spotify,best music app ever!,Cody Corder,4-Jun-16,5,"Has millions of songs! Also it only shows adds every 30 minutes, and the adds are only 14 seconds long! Also I can play a good song on and hop over to Minecraft and listen while I play! It plays songs on most of the games I have, even Fnaf!"
Spotify,Great except....,urrn4life,28-Dec-14,4,"I was a faithful Pandora listener both at home and work then I discovered Spotify. What's not to love? ad free, music available offline and they have every artist I look for. So why only four stars? Spotify has to do what Pandora manages seamlessly-allow me to block explicit content. I cannot stream radio at work for fear of the f-bomb emitting from my speakers. Fix that and you will have hit the sweet spot!"
Spotify,I absolutely love this app,PersonX,5-Jun-17,5,I. Just got a kindle and the first thing I wanted to download was  an app that I could playbmy music on. Spotify did just that. One thing I would change though is that there is no clean version of songs. I have a younger brother that cannot listen to my music because of some words said. Now I can inky use earbuds. Please fix this
Spotify,Great for Classical Music Lovers,cruisewhiz,10-Nov-17,5,"I love it. As a classical music lover, Spotify has all of the great classical labels."

Spotify,Dancing feet are dancing again,Lee Ann M.,2-Nov-17,5,"It works, has all my music already preset and I am good to go. Yes! Thank you Amazon!"
Spotify,Perfect!,Angela R,30-Nov-14,5,"I used to use Pandora  an  thought I would never use anything else. That is until I was looking for a music downloader and found this. So glad I downloaded it! Basically it's like Pandora and YouTube rolled into one. You can listen to stations, make your own stations, and my favorite part: you can search a specific song an  listen to it right then. You can also save your favorite songs to a playlist that you can listen to whenever! Another plus is that this app has NEVER crashed or malfunctioned in anyway since I've had it. Absolutely beautiful design as well, I love this app!"
Spotify,App needs work,Bryan,27-Jun-17,3,"I like Spotify, but their app needs a lot of work.  The layout is nice, the ads aren't that intrusive, but It's very slow to load and there are little touches that would make it more user friendly, such as placing a pause button on the lock screen of your phone."
Spotify,Is there a song you can't find on Spotify?,Michael Heckenberger,26-Jun-17,5,"Is there a song you can't find on Spotify? I am amazed at the wide variety of music on Spotify. If you love music, you need Spotify."
Spotify,playlist curators make spotlight great,annamt,1-May-16,5,"Enjoying this so far, accessible playlists are great for me as I find I have less time to create my own. Thanks to all the users curating great playlists on here, you are my heroes and you make the platform what it is."
Spotify,"Works perfectly in my Kindle Fire HD 7""",Diego RodrÃ_guez B.,28-Aug-16,5,"I thought this app wasn't going to be as complete as it is for the other platforms but I guess it's taken from the official Android one and it's complete!Everything I expect it to have it does. Can't really complain about anything, doesn't crash, not laggy (Kindle Fire HD 7"").Thank you Spotify!"
Spotify,Beatles and Dylan that you can no longer hear on youtube.,just wondering,31-May-17,5,"I just wish there were some videos. But, the sound is good, it's easy to use, and a good place to hear music that has been removed from youtube."
Spotify,10-Oct,Lizbeth Acucena Avalos Alvarez,13-Jun-16,5,10/10 great
Spotify,Three Stars,Frank O.,29-Jul-17,3,"Full version of the app is great, but the functionality with Apple CarPlay frankly sucks."

Try it & if not for you..you can uninstallâù£No commitmentâù£_Ÿ’‹âù£"
Spotify,Nothing like I Imagined !!!,d. ruff,14-Sep-16,5,This app is really awesome !!!! Nothing like other music apps. I like that you can listen to random music or create your playlists of songs you like !!! Other apps don't give you that option. I love this app !!!
Spotify,One of the best music players you can get for free,Dakota Rorie,1-Feb-15,5,"I use spotify all the time, especially when I'm studying. I always am happy with the music it suggests and I feel that it does a lot better job of guessing what kind of music I like to listen to than Pandora and other music apps. It kinda sucks that you have to get premium which is about twenty bucks a month to turn off ads and to download music off of the app, but that's about the same price other music apps charge and with spotify you get some extra perks for your money. Great app overall."
Spotify,5 stars | needs 1 improvement,Paul Stoddard,12-Nov-16,5,"Very nice idea!_Ÿ˜ƒ I can play my favorite songs anywhere! Pls just fix something... which is the music randomly goes away and off my task bar randomly.. pls fix that but overall, nice job! _Ÿ˜€"
Spotify,I love this app and it's pretty cheap for the monthly ...,Jewpina,15-Mar-17,4,I love this app and it's pretty cheap for the monthly premium subscription. There are times when a song or two are not available but I'm sure it has to do with licensing issues that come with artists and streaming services. Otherwise I think it's worth the $10
Spotify,great,Amazon Customer,28-Jul-17,5,It amazing
Spotify,Customer Service is Miserable,Amazon Customer,18-Aug-17,1,"Love their music service but clearly don't understand customer service! I understood that i had student premium plan for 12 months, when it was coming close to 12 months i talked to customer service and asked to renew again. They said they did it and i got charged for 9 months without student premium. My fault for not noticing right away, and its not about the money. But the amount of attitude i got for even showing a concern that i never got an email confirmation or an email stating that i must renew. Complete lies and honestly sad that Apple music has better customer service that Spotify. That more highly of them."
Spotify,This app is super cool!,Kindle Customer,21-Jan-17,5,I like the fact that I can follow my friends' playlists as well as search for new and old music alike. I have been introduced to new music I never knew I'd like and reminded about old bands that I forgot I loved. Highly recommend. Will pay for premium one of these days so I can skip songs but the free app is cool too.
Spotify,Spotify has all the music I like and it's easy to set up your lists,Mara Amazon Customer,30-Apr-17,5,Spotify has all the music I like and it's easy to set up your lists.  You can find whatever you want to listen to.
Spotify,Spotify App,Henrod,25-Dec-16,1,"I have downloaded this app 5 times. When it opens, all it says is ""Internal Error"" that I may not have a strong enough signal, but that does not appear th o be the problem. Heard this is a great app and want to use it, but right now, I'm not impressed."
Spotify,Great App,rnmteach,15-Sep-16,5,Great App.  Have access to my own music and some great playlists.  Even free with the ads isn't bad.

Spotify,Spotify is set up to help you find your own ...,Quin,22-Apr-15,5,"Spotify is set up to help you find your own personalized ""hidden gems"" and ""stumble-upons."" You can choose from lots of genres and sub genres and seemingly concocted styles to form your own playlists. And for 10 bucks a month you can have playlists available offline too. And if I'm not mistaken you can publish your playlists, and share playlists between friends (double check on that feature though). So yeah, Spotify's the bestest."
Spotify,Best music source yet! (besides YouTube),awesome,13-Jun-16,5,"I LOVE IT! This has almost everything! Only song writers who have not put the album's they make like some internet sensations are not on.

Spotify,Great for listening to music,Kathleen Kline,28-May-16,4,"I love using Spotify. It has nearly all the music I want. The free version does have ads, but I don't mind them so much. Although, recently the video ads have not been working, so I get stuck on the ad and can't move on to a different song. Other than that, Spotify is great!"
Spotify,Love it,rogerdl,8-May-17,5,"Great choices in music! I am a jazz aficionado, and this app gives me the best choices of music. I love it!"
Spotify,Excellent,marty,17-Aug-17,5,Money well spent. I just wish Spotify didn't have a download limit for devices.
Spotify,Do You Enjoy Malware?,Cheryl Patton,7-Aug-17,1,"It's never good when your laptop for business is down all day because of malware. I'm having to bust my laptop back to 0 because there is not a malware or antivirus program that can fix the problems of Spotify software. I can't tell you if using spotify is a good or bad thing. I couldn't get past all the garbage that their software downloaded to my computer. And I used the software from their personal website. Then, they wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade and pay for it. This has cost me enough."
Spotify,Excellent,Amazon Customer,9-Aug-17,5,This app is great! It's better than Pandora.Larry
Spotify,Completely the most efficient music app there is.,Swagstroid,13-Aug-17,5,"Within a library of millions of songs, artists, and community playlists, there is something for everyone, and Spotify makes the experience of finding it a joyful one.

Spotify,awesome,Jesper Falborg,22-Dec-15,5,Spotify has all the songs witch is awesome. It has every genre of music that you can think of and has the greatest songs. Also spot if uhh is cheap and has great deals. The moment that I got spotlight I got rid of all my of music apps. It's awesome how when I am on the road I can have downloaded music that I can listen to unlike Pandora. Spotify has songs on there that haven't even come out yet. You can listen to it on different devises when ever you want.
Spotify,Great app for a great platform.,Melissa Mullins,28-Jan-17,5,I'm a Spotify Premium user.  I've been using Spotify for nearly two years now and I love it.

Spotify,amaze-balls,bricks,3-Jan-16,5,"I love Spotify. The app is flawless. I use it every day, whether it be while playing the Xbox or going on a long road trip. Spotify is heaven for people of all music-tastes and I really thing it deserves 10 stars, not just 5. Although there is one problem. Literally, one. When trying to skip a song or two offline (I have premium), the song that I skipped to does not load and I have to wait to connect to WiFi before being able to listen to a different song, really confusing, because it says that I had premium. :|"
Spotify,good music app,dylan ellsworth,23-Feb-15,4,"For some reason the interface bugs me but other than that it works well, reminiscent of grooveshark but with not much of a limit (I think). Some songs are hard to find and I wish that they had an option to filter out clean versions of songs so I didn't have to add a song and go back and find the dirty version like some kind of Neanderthal after I realize this travesty."
Spotify,Piece of trash,Kindle Customer,21-Jul-17,1,"Would give a zero if possible.... It won't let me create an account.... It says that my ""information has changed"".... How has it changed?!?!

Spotify,Spotify.Com App For The Best Music Anywhere,Tygeign,27-Oct-17,5,Spotify perfect for every song you could think of. Spotify.Com is the very best of the best here on Amazon.Com. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great sale here on Amazon.Com Best of the Best

Spotify,The One Stop Music Spot,Philippe A. Lambert,20-Feb-15,5,"Spotlight is the best solution I have found to provide the quality, quantity and user friendliness that I expect from a music player. It is on in my life almost 24 hours a day. It allows me access to New artists as well as my age old favorites. I am a premium paying member which allows me access to my music even when I am off-line. I love my Spotify!"
Spotify,Nice app.,Hasan ALobaidi,16-Aug-17,1,"Nice app., But i can not sign up for the Premium Account, because i live in a non supported country."

Spotify,Spotify Music,Kitten,25-May-16,3,I purchased this so that I could get this program on my tablet and phone.  The down load went quick and I was able to view both on the table and phone that I have.  I would recommend this product.
Spotify,Tidal in this case is better and clearer,Johnny O,17-Feb-16,3,"Less than CD quality streaming. If you have audiophile class equipment, especially headphones. music especially the highs sound granular and perhaps slightly distorted. Tidal in this case is better and clearer. On normal class headphones it is good."
Spotify,It's Got Potential,S. Black,30-Apr-15,3,"Yet another music streaming app. The app's front end is annoying and has interface issues with Facebook. Off and on it took me three months to get it properly working on all my devices. Help is community based, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, I have mixed feelings about this app. However, it does have potential, and because of that I would give it a slight nod over its main rival, Pandora."
Spotify,just awesome,Susan Breen,16-Jul-17,5,"Blows Pandora out of the water. Awesome configurations easy to use, and just awesome."
Spotify,Great app,Michele,27-Sep-17,5,"I really enjoy this app,lots to choose from,not just music, you have poetry,podcasts.

Spotify,pretty good,Lillie,2-Feb-16,4,I love this app I use it everyday my only problem with it is that at first you can only shuffle you can't choose the song and it has to be online or you can't listen to it offline without buying Premium. I don't know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app
Spotify,Get it!,Tegan Shaw,11-Aug-15,5,I recommend Spotify to everyone! This is the best $10 I spend every month. It has almost everything from your local band that has 7 people go to their shows to the big boys. And you can listen to radio (with no ads all the skips you want) to find new music. It's really turned up my music game. I love New music Tuesday s my whole office listens to it then talks about it. Great bonding at the office.
Spotify,almost all I want,Jen Woolsey,2-Nov-15,4,"I used to listen to Pandora quite a bit, which my son introduced me to. Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me &#34;oh, I don't even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better.&#34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application (I haven't upgraded yet) is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."
Spotify,Bad,asleep in Seattle,3-Sep-17,1,Given up on trying to get this app to work...Pandora rules!
Spotify,I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot,Jim,16-Feb-16,4,I just use Spotify Free but I like it a lot . It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site.
Spotify,"No option to play just ""radio"", no explicit content, versions of songs.  Not good for kids or tweens.",Tim,28-May-17,1,"Spotify still doesn't see the need to provide any ability to control content, i.e. no option in settings to choose the ""radio"" version of songs and block explicit content versions.  Not only is this an issue for users under 18, but it's an issue if folks over 18 are want a music app to provide music at a party with kids.  They have a ""family plan"" but the app is not family friendly at all.  Also, all the lyrics are available for any user, no care about age.  As a parent I will not load this on my kids devices, as an adult I will not use it on my devices."
Spotify,Four Stars,MiniRhinks,20-Aug-17,4,"I hate the new update, it use to be good until it updated"
Spotify,Spotify is a very good free app,Shari Mc,3-Dec-15,4,"I'm using Free Spotify andI like it alot. It stays more true to the genre or artist you choose. This was a real problem with iheart, but in all fairness it's been awhile since I used that app. Pandora used to shut down all the time saying something about getting eaten by a bear. So you'd have to keep going back to the computer to let them know you were still listening."
Spotify,Great,Amazon Customer,17-Aug-17,5,I love it because I can listen to my favorite songs.
Spotify,Quality Music Player,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-17,5,"Awesome product to find any music you want, and organize/order it in any way you want. Find a song you like and listen on repeat, collect your favorites and hit shuffle, or set up your queue to play specific songs in the order you like. Download your favorites if you want to listen offline as well. Never regretted buying this product."
Spotify,it is awesome,jamie gregush,31-Mar-16,5,Spotify is awesome because you get to pick your own music and you get a 30 day free trial of all downloads on Spotify just not where you Getzlaf I premiums and it's also really find that means you will have Pandora add every time you skip that means you don't listen to your song so you like not get recommend it sucks
Spotify,good for a phone,Sarah Miller,20-Jan-15,4,If you have 4g lite it would be a lot better. But if you don't you have to upgrade it but it won't let me. I'd say it's good if you have Wi-Fi.
Spotify,Love This App!!,Rowena Winfrey,10-Jun-17,5,"With Spotify, I can create my own playlists, and fit my music to my mood! So glad it was created!"
Spotify,Amazing!,Dave Reed,24-Apr-17,5,"My dad got me premium, and I've been using it for over a year! Works great, took a while to get used to when I first switched from amazon prime, but other then that, it really works!"
Spotify,Best music app ever,Kindle Customer,11-Nov-17,5,I love this app it is such a great app I use it every day
Spotify,Terrible customer service,Steven,30-Sep-17,1,"App is awesome but the customer service is horrid. We cancelled a free trial we set my mom up with but for whatever reason, the cancellation didn't process. We were charged several months for no usage (because we thought it was cancelled). Spotify had no interest in discussing a refund or anything really. Keep in mind, I already have my own premium account and have had it for YEARS."
Spotify,Five Stars,Anthony Janczewski,21-Aug-17,5,Love this and its my #1 music app right now
Spotify,Wonderful!!,Amazon Customer,1-Sep-17,4,"Spotify is a wonderful free music app that I enjoy very much. I can create my own playlists and also listen to others. Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. That's not a ridiculous asking price I'm just too cheap.  I thoroughly enjoy this app!"
Spotify,If you love YOUR music,Chris Parker,23-Aug-16,5,I had heard about this but thought it was like Pandora.  This is not the case.  With Spotify you choose the music that is played.
Spotify,It's Great!,Kindle Customer,4-Sep-17,5,"Spotify is a great program for multiple reasons. One of them, it's free. Another, you don't have to have it open to listen to music. I definitely recommend it, it's a great program."
Spotify,Love it... Can't wait to upgrade!,Minerva P. Fuddles,24-Jun-17,5,"Nothing to smile about. The 9.99 price...per month.  Not worth it.  Would be better off sticking to the non premium version, putting up with the ads and not bothering to download anything.  Just kidding.  Wish I could afford it.  Maybe one day.  Why does the logo look like a... Nevermind."
Spotify,Good but neew momonthle,Silicon,11-Mar-16,4,"This is my own purchase for my sons. I personally is a very shopaholic person. Whever there is a deal , even just few bucks I am still may go fo it, including this current reviewing product. However, even I paid myself, I am still sometime has strong opinions...Like this spotify, everything is good except it is not free! LOL~"
Spotify,Required App,The Professor,17-Jul-17,5,"Spotify's great...but, then again, you already knew that."
Spotify,Five Stars,sara moscrip,19-Aug-17,5,Good variety. easy to find music that I like.
Spotify,Why'd I wait so long?,Scott Leffler,21-Jun-17,5,Why did I wait so long to try Spotify? The current 99 cents for 3 months deal pushed me over the edge. I may not be able to look back. The app works great on my Android phone and Kindle. But where it really shines is on my Echo.
Spotify,love it,Brian P.,18-Jul-17,5,"This is the greatest thing ever.i don't buy music any more. I use it at work home and in my car. I use premium, no commercial,plays what ever I feel like and when my selection is over it continues playing based on what I was listening to."
Spotify,Awesome,GlitterPrincess,1-Aug-14,5,This worked so well. At first I had no hope and thought that computer would be better but I was wrong. Even has Minecraft songs. You can even listen with your tablet and or android off. And to what I see on kindle fire HD it doesn't drain the battery. All you song fans out there who have a favourite song that they just love listening to sell you can listen to your fave song over and over again. I love this app
Spotify,I love it! Better them pAndora,Elizabeth Goodnough,16-Aug-17,5,Way better then pandora! Ha!
Spotify,Amazing!,minecraft 101,16-Jun-17,5,"I can listen to anyone I want for free! Plus, there's not that many ads."
Spotify,Best platform to listen to any kind of music,Kindle Customer,6-Aug-16,5,"Love Love LOVE Spotify!  Easily the best, most user friendly way to listen to music.  I love the wide variety of playlists to choose from- you can search a mood or situation (e.g. ""sad rainy afternoon"" or ""office friendly jams"") and *bam!* there is a whole list of potential new favorite playlists!"
Spotify,Awesome!!!!!!,Coolkid,5-Aug-17,5,Its a great app for free music you have to pay if you want to use it offline but I love how I can connect it to other devices and control it from my kindle.
Spotify,Splenderific,RHosein,4-Nov-17,5,This is the best app to listen to music and does not intrude your privacy
Spotify,Great App,Kindle Customer,23-Sep-16,4,"This is a music app that lets you can make custom music playlists for you to listen to.but there's one issue...you need wifi to use it!you need to get premium membership to download the music and listen to it anywhere.besides that,it's a great app.I highly suggest it."
Spotify,Awesome,The Lees,4-Mar-17,5,"Very good. Unlike many other music apps, you can love sten to what you want when you want to."
Spotify,LOVE THIS APP!#!!!!!!!,It is a fantastic game with cute animals!,18-Jun-15,5,I love this app it is very cool other apps would make you buy the music but in this music app you can just get a artists whole album for free and if you are a kid who is not allowed to have pay for WiFi they can give you three months of premium for just 99 cents get this app it is America axing you can even make your own playlists  and everything just get this app it also works on kindle fires :)
Spotify,_Ÿ‘çThumbs up,Tyler,18-Aug-17,5,"It's great that this app is free! Gives access to pretty much any song you'd want to listen to; with that said I did the free trial with the Premium account and haven't looked back. I use it every day on all my devices and absolutely love it. The ""recommended for you"" and ""discover"" features are also great"
Spotify,Great,Christine Wilson,11-Aug-17,5,I am a fan of spotify and the selection
Spotify,Five Stars,Jim Mc,13-Jul-17,5,I wouldn't listen to any other music app but spotify premium .
Spotify,A musical masterpiece of selection and artists,Marge Holt,30-Apr-17,5,"Always has the exact song or music I want to hear by various artists..even obsolete, rare finds!"
Spotify,Love this music app,D. E. Mendoza,20-Feb-15,5,"Love that I can add all the music I want to a playlist of my own creation, or choose to listen to an already made playlist. Its a great way to be introduced to new music/artists.When listening any where else but your computer, playlist can only be listened to with shuffle. This works perfect for me, its what I end up doing anyway."
Spotify,Like it,Spowers,2-Jun-17,4,I like the ability to play my music how I like to listen to it
Spotify,"Always improving, lots of really great features. (Spotify Premium)",Steven,14-Oct-16,5,"This app just keeps getting better and better, I've used it for 6 months now. Good updates and features that make using it easy and convenient. Good for finding similar bands to what you're listening to in real time, and seeing what your friends are listening to."
Spotify,Get Spotify Now,lakisha roberson,30-Jul-16,5,"Spotify is the ish,I'm so addicted to it.I like how your music is sorted to different playlist and if you haven't played a certain playlist they remind you of the playlist that you can come back to.The sound quality is terrific"
Spotify,really like it,Kindle Customer,26-May-17,5,it's easy to try new music and run across old forgotten favorites
Spotify,LOVE IT!!!,CatSimons,10-Sep-15,5,I absolutely LOVE Spotify. I have not been able to find one fault with it. They have A TON of music and I mean a ton. I pay for the premium version every month and it is completely worth it. There's no need for me to buy music anymore. Yes it's that good.
Spotify,"I love spotify, I switched to spotify over pandora long ...",Christopher Chen,13-Oct-16,5,"I love spotify, I switched to spotify over pandora long ago. I still use it but I do wish the spotify premium was cheaper..."

Plz add some I miss meh JPOP music D:"
Spotify,Spotify,vernon h. doyle,16-Jan-17,5,"For home use, Spotify is hands-down the best service out there. Not so much so on the go because of a lack of selectability of your artist's songs and albums. I it may be asking to much but it would be nice if you could use Alexa to control Spotify without having to pay for the premium upgrade."
Spotify,BEST MUSIC APP IN THE ENTRE WORLD!!!!,Rondell Carson,18-Jun-16,5,"If you're looking for an EPIC music app look no further and download Spotify, I'm the kinda person who listens to music 24/7 and I've tried DOZENS of music apps and none compare to Spotify.

Spotify,Great app,nat,1-Apr-16,4,"Great app. It plays music from many different artists with good audio. The only reason  I didn't rate this five stars is because they don't have certain artists, probably the most popular one Taylor Swift. That's too bad, since this is a great app."
Spotify,Roxx!,James W. Kidwell,17-Aug-17,5,"I went through yahoo music, Google radio, Rhapsodxy (crap!), and being sold around and around until I quit.  I chose Spotify.  I still choose Spotify. I recommend it to everyone."

You can follow a muse and pick an artist you've liked in the past and see the body of their work. I re-discovered  Electric Light Orchestra ELO  lots of fun to listen. And now  to Classical music is  unlimited,  hearing Composers I never heard before. Great."
Spotify,Spot on,TEXASGIRL,3-Nov-17,5,Love the options it provides - I can't get premium now as I lost my job in Aug - but music makes it all ok
Spotify,Love it!,Amazon Customer,5-Aug-17,5,Large music library. Love that it makes daily mix playlists based off of what I listen to. Radio stations are great too. I have premium and I think it's worth it.

Sound quality is great and it includes ads that when watched allow 30 minutes of ad free music _Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜„ Almost all songs available plus acoustic and remix versions.

Spotify,"If you have wide-ranging listening desires, Spotify has it all.",Clark Haberman,31-Oct-14,5,"I have used both the free and upgrade versions. If you do not like commercials the upgrade is the way to go and the cost is not prohibitive.

You can find ""old"" or ""new"" tunes or albums ranging from classical to country with ease. Fill your library and enjoy as I have over the past five years."

Spotify,must have for thoose who like to spend their money wisely.,KaseyLynn,17-Feb-15,5,"Get this, there's offline option. I use no other means to listen to music anymore.And to ""artist"" like Taylor Swift who are not on it (every other artist is on it) your s*** isn't worth listening to anyway. We pay for sporting it may not be much but not everyone wants to spend 13.99 on a s*** pop CD when you can spend 9 on sporting and listen to every other amazing artist to grace this earth haha"
Spotify,I listen to this app everyday,Marguerite Freeman,7-Jul-17,5,I listen to this app everyday. I wish I didn't need premium to listen to spotify offline.
Spotify,So so,Tracy E. Bielaczyc,1-Aug-16,2,I love the millions of music choices I have but I can not play the song I want when I want without buying the full version. I love the songs that have in my library but sometimes I am in the mood for one song and not the other. Also it does not help that I can not listen to music via spotify in a no wifi range. I could Download the song but that will also cost me money. And if you decide to do the one week free trial pressing download will not actually download the songs .
Spotify,I like Spotify as a way to hear my favorite songs ...,David Roebke,12-Jun-15,4,"I like Spotify as a way to hear my favorite songs on a playlist. The only problem I have with the app is there is no ""back"" key to get out of a dialogue link I don't want or accidentally got. Also, it would be a great help if the app had a ""directions for this page"" pull-down menu.  Otherwise, once I learn the ins and outs, I think it will be a great addition."
Spotify,Great Service even at the non-pay level,Linda Elliott,21-Dec-16,5,The basic non-pay service offers quite a selection of music and we're having fun building our own custom playlists.  Great music offered.  We did purchase a blue tooth speaker for the house and are enjoying music that we love without having to change CDs or search for an additional channel since we have already build our playlists.  Great service.

Spotify,Ndhevf,FrenchBiscuts,15-Jan-17,5,Don't mind the title I couldn't think. This app is an amazing use and not a waste of time. Recommended for anyone who loves music. Though Spotify could use a couple of more night core songs. Other than that everything is fine _Ÿ‘Œ
Spotify,I love Spotify.,Amazon Customer,21-Jan-15,5,"I really love the Spotify Music App. because I can pick all the songs I want to hear without the ones i don't want to hear.  I am a huge fan of the 70's hits and you never get to hear the ones you want on a regular radio. Also I love all kinds of Christian music. I don't have to hear a lot of stuff between songs, I can go to the the song I want to. Thanks  Spotlight.Sherry HepnerCalifornia"
Spotify,I absolutely love this app,Robert Kerr,16-Oct-16,5,I absolutely love this app. You will find pretty much find  any kind of music and song title you are looking for. And the fact that if you subscribe to the premium service you can listen to the music offline. In my opinion Spotify is the best music app out there.
Spotify,Forget you Pandora,Jon & Britt,29-Feb-16,5,"WAY better than Pandora! Free music that's actually not too limited without premium but premium is cheap and its really cool. All your favorite songs, albums, and all music that Spotify is able to get their hands on for free. FORGET paying $1.99 per song. For mobile devices, as long ass you have WiFi you have Spotify without using data. And with premium you can be wiout WiFi and without the data loss. I personally that no its amazing."
Spotify,... can think of and this is by far my favorite user friendly app,Mhkfw,4-Mar-17,5,I've used all the music apps you can think of and this is by far my favorite user friendly app. Has everything you could want and great for sharing with friends. I honestly think it's one of the greatest inventions of all time. Thanks Spotify!
Spotify,Awesome.,Katie Baker,13-Dec-16,5,"You have total control of everything you want to listen too, as long as Garth Brooks isnt what you want to hear, lol. Set up your playlist with anything you can think of in a certain order or just hit shuffle and you have listening for hours or days depending on how much you want."
Spotify,Almost Perfect,Michael Brooks,8-Apr-17,4,"Two things keeping this from 5 stars, 1) there's no sleep timer for android. I know there's some work arounds and apps, but it should already be there (use IHeartRadio when going to sleep for this issue) and 2) certain bands/songs missing. If either of these issues ceased (or both), 5 stars."
Spotify,I love it!,vieille_ame58,4-Apr-16,5,When I first heard about Spotify I thought it was just another streaming music service but boy was I wrong.It's just what I been looking for! An avid Jazz fan I cannot tell you how many titles I have found that weren't on many of the other services. Whatever your genre Spotify has it!

With headphones the acoustics is awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. I can locate any song ever played and at it to my play list! The app doesn't drain the battery, user friendly:), and have very little if any commercials. I have tried quite a few music apps but after finding this gem I deleted all of the others. I play one song of my favorite artist/group and Spotify continues on with the songs from the same group/singer.Thanks Spotify!!"

It's a great, carefree app. There are a few ads with the free version, but so far they don't bother me. They do have a service without ads for a monthly fee, for those who prefer it."
Spotify,"Everyday, all day, the soundtrack to my life",Ally M,13-Jan-17,5,"I have found so many playlists that satisfy me, no matter what my mood. Music I want to enjoy, all day with no commercials.

Spotify,my hit station,ariel one,18-Jan-15,5,"I love spotlight very much, the innovation of having music is very attentive to the listener's choices of what type of music to enjoy, only wish that the commercial could be weakened out a little more so that the listener's can enjoy more without signing up for the premium. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get the quality of music and sound they are looking for in music"
Spotify,Amazing!,Michael P Phillips,27-Aug-17,5,This app is so great! You can all the songs you love from Twenty one pilots to Sam Hunt! You can make your own playlist and pick songs that you love! This app is always satisfactory to me._Ÿ‘ç
Spotify,I would give a -100 if I could. Spotify ...,JBH,13-Apr-17,1,I would give a -100 if I could. Spotify has removed your ability to play your playlist on Roku. I can no longer listen to my music through my sound system connected to the television and Roku which is pumped throughout the house. When I contact Spotify and Roku they constantly duck the  issue pointing the finger at each other. I am cancelling after 4 years of membership because Spotify doesn't mind jerking their customers around! No care for customers=No customers!
Spotify,Amazing,Anaya Davis,18-May-16,5,I've been using app for many years and  I LOVE IT  you can add songs to your playlist and unlike pandora giving so much commericials it gives just about 2 commercials in spotfiy but because i bought the premium i can create my own playlist and listen to what ever music i want to listen thank spotify you really saved me

While I'm sure I screwed up that sentence grammatically, it is far and away best on the kindle and it's not even close. On the kindle app, I can add songs to the queue, search much easier, find the artists that I follow and it is just plain easier to use."

Spotify,Spotify Rocks,Jolene Wipf,5-Oct-14,5,I only listen to the free music. I do not purchase the upgrade to listen commerical free. The commercials on the free level can be annoying. Spotify works perfectly. It is easy to search for music. Users can create their own playlists. You can listen to or follow a playlist created by someone else. The variety of available music genres and artists is large enough that everyone can find something they like.
Spotify,Best subscription music service on the market.,Michael,5-Nov-15,5,Best subscription service of all time.  I have not liked a music service this much since the real Napster.  I will say that Apple Music has several artists that spotify is missing(Taylor Swift).  However Apple Music does not currently work with android devices.  No android is a deal breaker for me.  Amazon's Prime music service is missing so many artists it is hardly worth mentioning.
Spotify,Stimulate Mind and Body,In Style with Savings,28-Apr-17,5,"With Spotify, I never hear the same ol' same ol'. I am hearing many songs for the first time by my favorite artist.

Spotify,Better with than without,Happy Gramma,20-Dec-16,4,"Just signed up a few days ago, so can't honestly give it the 5 stars ... yet.  I do like what I've heard so far.  A very extensive range of music and when picking your likes, it offers more within that category, which is a nice feature.  That said, I haven't found all my tastes in music at this point, but again, I haven't had much time to ""play"" with it.  Definitely enjoy my music life better with than without it!!"
Spotify,My favorite app. I can listen to this all day ...,Thomas,1-Mar-17,5,My favorite app. I can listen to this all day and night. You can listen to music with the screen off so it saves battery. I can listen to an 8 hour long playlist and turn the screen back on with battery life left to spare.

Spotify,"So long Beats, hello Spotify",Jerimy,6-Dec-15,5,"Subscribed to Beats for over a year, and I loved it, used it daily, but the transition to Apple Music for Android was less than nominal.  Spotify has an equally massive library, with an interface that is both simple and functional.  I subscribed midway through my 7 day trial. :)"
Spotify,Good,Dulleya Woods,9-Jul-17,4,I love this app! I only give it a four due to the fact that not every song is on here.
Spotify,Update,Stephanie A. Bowman,18-Sep-15,3,Spotify came out with an update that makes it to were everything is shuffle play unless you buy premium. So every time I want to listen to a song I have to hit shuffle play and hope for the best. But I found that the best way to find your song is to either make small playlists or quit the app and go back into it when it's not your song.
Spotify,Spotify,Jetski,6-Nov-15,4,"This app is great for Kindle! I love how when you close the app it still plays music, and it's even better because it is free!

It's not just an app for listening to music but also has audio books, selections to learn different languages, and stories among other stuff. There is something for everyone and it is simple and easy to use. My only complaint is that when listening on my kindle there is no back button in the drop down bar at the top. When you are in another app and want to go back you have to reopen spotify to do so."

It saves ur current artists you have been listening too! Create ur own playlists! At times the serve is down but it's only for short periods! U can do about anything you like! Better then Pandora!! Ads aren't long or bad hardly come on! I haven't upgraded cuz I don't need too!!
Spotify,A Classic App,SamsonCarlMiller,20-Feb-15,5,"I have always been scouting for an app that truly understands my music tastes and preferences, and Spotify is just the app. It is currently free, compared to before when you had to pay (but it was worth the price anyway).Definitely a try, given that it's free and even better in its recommendations of soundtracks that you might not chance upon using other apps or websites such as YouTube.However, as it is a free app (for now), be prepared for ads to be inserted in the midst of your playlist though there is a paid feature to turn off the ads."
Spotify,Spotify is Great!,Aaron,24-May-17,5,Love spotify!  It is everything I wanted in a streaming music app.
Spotify,Great!!,Patti M. Lareau,22-Jan-17,5,"This app is great with bunches and bunches of playlists picked by Spotify and some from other people, tons of artists, and not just the ones that are popular right nowor even in this country. Its especially cool because, at least on my version of one of the newer kindles, music from YouTube won't stay playing in another tab or when in an app, but Spotify will."
Spotify,Used daily,JoeMP,22-Dec-16,5,"I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"

Spotify,"Good Variety In music, but can't listen offline without paying.",Blackford,22-Feb-15,4,"Now, to begin, let me just say that Spotify is nearly as good as Amazon Prime. Nearly. The only downside to it is that you have to pay $9.99 a month if you want to listen to all your favorite tunes offline. Other than that, THIS APP IS AWESOME. The variety of music makes it hard for me to choose what to listen to next, and you can create your own playlists for free."
Spotify,"great price and service, app acts weird",instacat,22-Mar-16,4,"For the relatively small price of a basic subscription, the options of downloading REALLY great music to your phone to stream no matter where you are and unlimited skips, this service is a steal. However, the unexpected stops while streaming data free can be frustrating, though it is more likely a glitch with the app than the service itself. Apart from that, I love it!"

Spotify,Awesome,Jordyn Oines,26-Oct-14,5,This is so nice because you get to choose your songs and not just the artist like Pandora. I recommend this if you want to listen to certain songs. It is very nice when I want to listen to a certain song or songs. And you can add songs when ever you want and there is no limit. I think this is better than Pandora because you get to listen to songs you put on and with Pandora you get to choose the artist not song and it doesn't even stay on that artist.

Spotify,A great app to use every day!,smartest_customer,27-Dec-14,5,"I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."

Spotify,SPODIFI,Deed nuts,5-Jun-17,5,Spotify is a very good app you only have to watch a 20 second add and then you can listen to music for 30 minutes you can listen to any song when you want and there is no max skip like I heart_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜€_Ÿ˜€â˜ºâ˜ºâ˜º_Ÿ˜®_Ÿ˜®_Ÿ˜®
Spotify,The best variety of music,Amazon Customer,31-May-17,5,I like the quality and variety of music you have so I like this app a lot. But I don't buy premium so I deal with a ton of adds but I still like the app anyway.
Spotify,Works great. One of the few apps that work fine ...,Eddie C.,26-Oct-16,5,"Works great. One of the few apps that work fine on Amazon, I did have a problem at first with logging in, but since then I am able to log on with no problems and the sound quality is amazing from my Amazon HD 10."
Spotify,great app I love it but...,d.d,24-Mar-17,4,It has a few bugs to work out. I use this app daily and I love it. The ads are kinda annoying and the 30 minutes with no ads isn't always 30 minutes. Other than that I love it
Spotify,Absolutely Positively Fantastic!!!,Amazon Customer,14-May-17,5,I love it! I have found everything I have looked for from the Beatles to the Lemon Pipers to Scott Joplin and John Coltrane and Itzhak Perlman!!!!
Spotify,great app for music listeners,Vanessa Berlin,7-Aug-16,5,"I really enjoy Spotify. It has an easy to use interface, it is customizable to your tastes, you can create your own playlists, and best of all you can listen to music offline. For all of these reasons Spotify is a win win situation for me."
Spotify,SO I'm ticked.,Kindle Customer,14-Sep-15,2,I just downloaded this onto my kindle to see how it worked and it was really fun. I loved it. But now I can't play anything or skip without downloading prime. I came here for free music. Also the he click the banner thing kind of sucks be cause the banners really big and kind of hard not to hit sometimes.
Spotify,Best music app ever!,Steven,4-Aug-15,5,"This amazon version is way better than the phone version. On the phone version you can only save your favorite songs then have them shuffled. You can't pick what ever song you want. However, on this app, you can choose whatever song you want, shuffle the music, all with just a few ads every 30 minutes."
Spotify,Yes,Kindle Customer,7-Aug-17,5,Awsome i can listen to my favorite songs

Spotify,Great alternative to using Youtube to listen to music--not to mention it's FREE,Nicole,15-Nov-15,5,"It works just as well for Kindle as it does on my laptop and my husband's PS4. I haven't done much aside from saving the songs/albums I like and listening to them. The availability of some of the artists is really nice, compared to other programs that don't have the latest music."
Spotify,I see why everone loves Spotify,Avid reader,18-Jul-16,5,"I see why everyone loves Spotify. The only thing I wish was different is I wish it would let me re-order the items in my playlist. Apparently the songs stay in the order you add them. There's a 'shuffle play' option, but that's it."

Spotify,it's the best,the best,5-Sep-16,5,I can use it on my kindle fire like I'm on my own world I can pick the music I want I can share the device if I want to but I may have ads and stuff but I won't get the premium it too much for music if your gonna download it on your phone just don't cause it's not as the best like on as kindle fire _Ÿ˜¢_Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜„_Ÿ_¶_Ÿ_¶_Ÿ_¶_Ÿ_µ_Ÿ_´_Ÿ_µ
Spotify,Best Free Music App,The Doctor,8-Feb-15,5,"This app allows you to play music/songs. If a WiFi connection you can create and play playlists with almost any music you could want. By purchasing premium you can also download the music from your playlists to listen to at anytime. The free version does occasionally play ads, however two 30 second ads every 30 minutes or so is worth it considering the amount of selection and customization available for free."
Spotify,Five Stars,GPoteat,20-Aug-17,5,I enjoy spotify music
Spotify,My favorite.,Nick C,9-Apr-17,5,Great way for me to listen to music on the go or at home. Has a ton of mainstream and indie music. They keep on adding new features and improvements. Can't complain about the price as I feel like I get my $$$ worth.

I enjoy building my own library, and I've made and shared playlists with a couple of people. I also like that you can add others' playlists to your account. I find this app to be extremely easy to use and plan to continue it as my favorite music app."
Spotify,I love how you can download the songs in high quality ...,RON N.,9-Dec-16,5,"Use Spotify all the time to listen to music. I love how you can download the songs in high quality to listen to them anywhere. Not only that, but I get to be up to date with all the top songs to listen to!"

Spotify,Amazing selection (mostly),MisterMacWaffle,28-Sep-17,5,I really enjoy all the gems on Spotify.  But some of the albums I've saved have disappeared randomly (Motorhead's last album among others).  Would like to know if it's gone forever...but other than occasionally that it's a great system and app

Spotify,OMG THIS IS AMAZING,Robin Stalls,2-Feb-17,4,This is the best music app in the whole world!!!!I think everyone should get this music app if they are a music fan. My only complants are that it needs internet and when I x out of it completely it won't let me listen to music for like five minutes. It deserves a 4 star rating.
Spotify,Amazing,cool,5-Aug-17,5,I can listen to all the songs i love offline and there aren't too many ads
Spotify,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Kindle Customer,15-Jun-16,5,Best music experience! Love all the playlist. I get to hear new music and artist. For $7.99 I get to download music and not have to use my data to listen.  Also has books and poems! No commercials. Come on what's not to love!

Spotify,Five Stars,Matt,14-May-17,5,works as expected!
Spotify,Forget Pandora,SteveV,9-Jul-15,5,"Compared to Pandora better sound, more control of audio quality, and  you choose the songs ..... and it plays them. It doesent throw unexpected songs/artists that they think you will like. I like this feature and the quality of sound much better than  Pandora. I have used pandora since its inception."
Spotify,I absolutely LOVE using Spotify,Dena,24-Aug-17,5,"I absolutely LOVE using Spotify!! Especially the Discovery section...it knows what type of music I love and finds more like it for me to add to my playlist.  It's easy, convenient, and fun to use!"

Spotify,Has almost everything I've ever looked for.,FAZ,25-Oct-16,4,"From early Porgy and Bess, to Amazon Rainforest recordings, to latest Rhyanna, pop,  to Theta brainwave enhancing recordings, have rarely not found what I'm looking for. Would like more world wide multi lingual offerings, and a senior discount! Thanks for a great product."
Spotify,"Highly recommended, dunno what I did before I had this",Mojo,5-Oct-17,5,"Highly recommended, dunno what I did before I had this. It functions much easier on my computer than on my phone."
Spotify,Four Stars,S. J. Pajewski,12-Sep-17,4,Good story.
Spotify,Pretty Great,Denise Ruelle,9-Aug-17,4,Great app.  Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. _Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ_µ_Ÿ_¶
Spotify,Great Service and App,Devin Stephens,20-Aug-15,5,Works great on my kindle fire HDX and HD 6..  I also use it on other android devices but downloaded from google play..  The app itself is easy to navigate and easy to use.. I have no issues with the app or service
Spotify,Great App,Taisiya,14-Sep-16,5,"I love this app! I find it great that you could literally search of almost every song and see it, and how you could go and look at any music for your mood! Although the adds are annoying(not lying, I memorized them), it doesn't come up every 3 or so songs, so I'm happy."
Spotify,Four Stars,Patti Cole,28-Aug-17,4,"Downloaded, new haven't enough plays to comment---later."
Spotify,Give this a go,Kindle Customer,12-Jan-16,5,Great music idea for on the go listening of your favoriat stations and singers. Check to see  if the spotify app is compatable for your android devise.
Spotify,Best. Music. App. Ever!!!!!!!,Amazon Customer,14-Mar-17,4,Spotify is the bomb for music apps because it is gtreat and has basically every song out there!!  I do wish there was a way to get rid of that thing where like if your listening to music while your in the shower and it says click here for no ads you can't click it and then ypou have ads!!!!
Spotify,Cool music app,Amazon Customer,10-Nov-17,5,Great design. Fun. So far all the songsIâ€™ve looked for have been here.
Spotify,Five Stars,ann,24-May-17,5,GOOD
Spotify,It's amazing But...,sfury4,3-Mar-16,4,Its great I love it!!!!! My got to app for music!!!! But I think that it should make an update letting people like me that have a kindle. Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!
Spotify,Great music service,Bill B,21-Aug-17,4,One of the few services that plays the whole album.  Strong signal and few commercials.
Spotify,Good - Could Be Great with a Little Work,Jason Pucel,27-Aug-14,3,"Spotify is the music player of choice for my entire family. Tap into a vast amount of music with this app. We love for the Spotify platform.However:This app really needs to be revisited as tablets, phones, and non-traditional operating systems (i.e. Chromebooks and Linux) become more prevalent and users begin to use these devices as their primary access to the internet. There are features that are unavailable with this app which make playlist management cumbersome at best. It seems that if you are going to fully utilize the amazing Spotify service you need to have a Windows (or maybe Apple? - I am not an apple user) machine and a copy of the local software."
Spotify,your music your way,peter,16-Sep-15,5,"In this century CD is almost obsolete  the new trend is of course digital music online or on a digital device(mp3,mp4,IPhone,IPad,tablet etc)SPOTIFY is a top shelf way of finding your favorite music it doesn't get much easier to use than this !GREAT JOB SPOTIFY  May the music force be with you and I hope you live long and prosper!"
Spotify,Great music,Caroline,22-Dec-16,5,"I love that I can search for specific composers and artists. There are a huge number  of playlists available so I can listen to music I would never have found on my own. Spotify does require a paid subscription, but it's worth it to me. I have found the free services to be limited and I'm sometimes stuck listening to music I don't !ike."
Spotify,Five Stars,Lonnie D. Thornton,15-Mar-17,5,Works well.
Spotify,Nice but one compliant,B. Shilling,3-Feb-17,4,"This is a great app but my one complaint is that when I open it, it says I am offline, but I am in my own house, and,for some reason, I am only nine but I listen to songs like Your Gonna Go Far Kid by The Offspring. :)"
Spotify,Better than my own song library,guy man person dude,8-Nov-17,5,"This app works so well, I'll never pay for another song again."
Spotify,Spot,Laura,10-May-17,5,I was glad that I found this application and all I do is listen to it all the time. Use to listen to pandora but prefer this one
Spotify,Great app but a couple of tweaks could go a long way,Amazon Customer,1-Jan-15,4,"I love this app (and Spotify in general) but I guess the thing that continually drives me crazy is that there is no way to properly sort by album name (the album's tab sorts by artists and then by album). I know it sounds nitpicky, but it's one of things I come across all the time and just grates!"
Spotify,Three Stars,Bob Richardson,9-Aug-17,3,its ok
Spotify,I LOVE IT!!,Molly,8-Jul-15,5,"This app is better than Pandora. For example, you can repeat the song that your listening to, and make play lists. Spotify also has Radios with UNLIMITED skips. You can follow people on Spotify, but there is no messaging other people. So, you can repeat you favorite songs, make play lists, have radios with UNLIMITED skips, and you can follow people but no messages, now that's great deal for free!"
Spotify,Fabulous Music,Kindle Customer,2-Oct-15,5,The music I love is not commonly found on radio. So it is so wonderful to find it on Spotify!
Spotify,I enjoy music probably more than any one I know,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-17,2,I enjoy music probably more than any one I know.  My son put me on to Spotify and I thoroughly enjoy it.  Some time ago I thought I had lost it and I just about panicked since I had so much time invested in building up my lists.  Listen to it almost daily.
Spotify,Just needs free download,I love this game I needed to buy it,28-Oct-17,4,"I love Spotify and its great but I have to pay for download and thought it was free but its not, please make it free."
Spotify,Premium user not worth it.,Lolach444,24-Aug-15,1,"Songs with explicit content are constantly deleted without reason, there's no enough music and the app version does not allow you to choose your song (Shuffle mode), I miss grooveshark so much, spotify sucks big time. :(I hate the fact that the ""offline mode"" is only music stored in your cache memory and you don't actually own the song, so it's not worth it to pay for the premium user because you are not downloading the songs you can't keep them, recomendations are not accurate with what I would like to listen to, and radios have always the same songs.Have been a daily user since grooveshark was closed, actually I think spotify should be free, because you don't get what you pay for."
Spotify,Awesome,Cinderella2300,16-Feb-16,5,"This is an awesome app and I love it! I can use anywhere (when you have premium)  and yopu can search artists and artist radios. Yo can even listyen to 80s or 90s music on it! My first thoughts when I got Spotify were &#34;Whoa, how have I never heard of this before!!?&#34; You van also broadcast it onto other devices and sterile without an aux cord!"
Spotify,A SpotifyER,Ladybugz,17-Sep-16,5,I really enjoy Spotify. I like how it recommends certain music just by what I listen to. The podcasts are also another perk. I upgraded just so I could get the full on benefits. The cost is minimal compared to what Spotify offers. It pays for itself!!!!!
Spotify,Use this daily,Mommato2cuties,3-Apr-16,4,"I wish you could organize your individual playlists in an order you want like you can on desktop. Whenever I create a new playlist, my main starred playlist (which I use most) gets pushed all the way to the bottom. :(Otherwise love this app. It makes my commute so much better and it is a good price."
Spotify,Five Stars,M. Marc,3-Mar-17,5,wish it was free :(
Spotify,Five Stars,SO,28-Apr-17,5,Great
Spotify,"Disappointed, really.",Samantha Toth,4-Nov-15,1,"So yeah, it was nice when I first downloaded it. I got to choose what song I listened to, and I didn't have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can't choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I couldn't care less about, and now I can't even skip it because I've reached my limit, skipping the songs I don't want to listen to.I got an app that wasn't like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it's changed into the equivalent of that.To sum it all up,I can't choose my own musicI couldn't care less about the suggested musicI hate the song-skip limitI just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I'm unable to skip over to the song I want.I'm just disappointed, tbh."
Spotify,Can't do without it.,Ormalou,31-May-17,5,"I listen to it every day. Poor Pandora got left out in the cold. I haven't used the commercial free yet, but plan on it soon."

Spotify,Great Service.,Simon Wojcik,25-Dec-15,5,"Love this service. Used to have rhapsody. Now they suck. Thank god I found Spotify. Amazon Prime Music is starting to suck a bit too. Spotify all the way! Music, Audiobooks, Language courses, famous speeches, Poetry and more. Seriously? It is totally worth the $10/month."
Spotify,Love the whole idea that I can create a playlist,Miss tia,14-Jan-16,3,Love the whole idea that I can create a playlist. Love the fact that I can listen to music that I haven't heard in a while don't like the fact that I can't shuffle my own playlist without the purchase of 10.00 monthly to play my playlist that I've created.
Spotify,Great Music Selection,L. M. Keefer,10-Jun-15,5,My son downloaded Spotify Music for me - it's amazing the selection of music and the sound quality seems great.  Have listened to many of my favorite songs.  It's helpful to see how popular certain songs are for an artist if you want to sample some new songs and see what others like.
Spotify,I do have the paid version and I am happy !!!,Alexandre,9-May-17,5,"Fantastic product, love it. no more CD's, no more dealing with MP3 files, no messy USB devices ... I recommend Spotify, especially if you have a diverse taste for music ..."

I've been collecting music in all formats seemingly forever; but now I realize most times I wanna listen to something in my archives it's easiest just to stream it on Spotify!!!

But lately, when I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it gives me an ad within two songs. All the time. The ads have increased tremendously and I don't know what's changed.  I know I'm using the free app, but it's ridiculous that they tell me I'm getting 30 minutes of ad free music and then they play an ad after the next song or two"

Spotify,"Nice, I guess.",Yan Yang,30-May-16,4,"This is one of my favorite apps. I love/need my music, and the fact that I can play it in the background is great. However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars."

Spotify,DR 'Z',Dennis Zorn,1-Dec-16,5,"Unlike other music venues, I love the way you can listen to an entire album of a particular artist instead of only one song jumbled up among a bunch of other songs and artists. I love this format, I uninstalled the other venues."

Spotify,J,Amazon Customer,23-Aug-17,5,Really enjoy being able to listen to the albums and different artist and enjoying the songs I like the most. Thank you for this app. I get to review songs and be exposed to other songs I would not have heard.
Spotify,Freedom without restrictions,MOANA,19-Mar-17,5,"I love that Spotify suggests other music Artists to match the music genre chosen, and allows you to browse through the suggested Artists' music via Singles, Album, or Collaboration and place it in your own created Playlist or one already generated."
Spotify,It was great..,D. Z. A.,19-Jan-17,3,"It would be nice if it didn't get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there's ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device."

Spotify,YAS,Good app!,18-Jun-17,5,"I only got it today and I love it! I'm really into game music and that's there, and it doesn't only do 10 seconds of the music, like downloadable music. If I don't do downloadable music I do YouTube, but it takes a couple minutes more than this app. So, if you want to save time and listen to music, this app is for you!"

Spotify,Offline,Styx Karamia,17-Dec-14,2,It seems like everyday that I get on this app some time of the day it appears that the app has no internet. I have to go to my wireless settings and turn them on and off to get the app to go online just to listen to my music. Wouldn't mind if this was just once in a while but its every day. Fix it.

Spotify,Awesome alternative for Pandora,Brooksea2K,9-Aug-16,5,"Awesome alternative for Pandora.  Switched because of some company views with which I didn't agree.  Sorry I haven't switched before. The option to listen to one artist or mix with other artists and create your own ""station"" is way better than Pandora's.  I wont be going back to them."
Spotify,Something Different Please?,Ella Brand,14-Dec-16,2,"I simply cannot find my groove with this app. As an artist who has my music on Spotify, it is very frustrating when you can't even find your own music. But sure enough, the same old big names pop up as usual. So sick of it. Will someone please do something different?"
Spotify,Awesome,Bob Marley,13-Aug-17,5,It's a great app this is child appropriate and you can make playlists. The only thing I don't like is if you don't pay for premium you can't pick your songs _Ÿê__Ÿê_

We subscribed to the family package but are rethinking our decision.  We do not like that we can not filter the  music on our kid's tablets.  We also have to be careful when playing music in the house.  I have checked online and there are years worth of complaints about this same thing.  Why hasn't Spotify fixed this?"

Spotify,BEST MUSIC APP EVER,Lex-Skywalker,12-Apr-16,5,"Way better than Pandora. With Pandora, you just listen to ""stations"". However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to "" download"" the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."

It's super easy to search for any song (even the most obscure), curate amazing playlists, and  save songs you Shazam. The radio feature is way better than Pandora and their existing playlists in the Browse section are pretty decent. Also love that I can follow my friend's playlists."

Spotify,Works Great!,Amazon Customer,26-Aug-17,4,"Works great! I have searched over 200 songs on Spotify and I found all but 3. I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can't play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app."

Spotify,Better Than Pandora,Luis,23-Mar-16,5,"I had pandora thinking nothing could be better than this and thought maybe I'll give spotify a try. Believe me I was surprised, spotify had music that pandora didn't have yet! Also there were way more features on the free version that Pandora 's paid version didn't even have like how you can play certain songs on genres, the radios obviously has limits but it gives me way more control."
Spotify,Great but loud ads,Kindle Customer,6-May-16,4,"Great variety of music, love that you can save songs and make playlists. Only negative so far is that the ads are significantly louder than the music at least 2/3 of the time, painfully so especially if you have on headphones."

Spotify,Best Music App!,Amazon Customer,29-Sep-14,5,"Spotify is definitely my new favorite music app. I love how organized it all is and how you are able to create and name your own personal playlists. It is also up to date with some of the newer music, yet still has some of the older, still good music. I love the variety of bands and artists it provides and the organization offered. So if you haven't thought of it yet, Spotify is the app to get for playing music. :)"
Spotify,I give it 5stars,Sarah Stockum,23-Dec-15,5,You can get WiFi  free trial.

Spotify,works seamlessly,Amazon Customer,22-Feb-15,5,"Syncs to all devices easily. Intuitive design makes it easy to create playlists and organize your music.  I like their radio function better than pandora, less repetition of liked songs. Only unable to find a very few artists.

Spotify,Pandora convert,DIANE,26-Aug-17,5,"I am a convert from Pandora.  I listen to new age music to sleep and the constant commercials got to be irritating...and I didn't want to pay extra just for sleep music.  With Spotify and my prime membership I have never had a commercial, listen to the station I like, select tracks I like and download them so I can listen offline in a cabin in the woods or anywhere I want to be lulled back to sleep.  Plus online I hear new stuff on the station I chose to expand my playlist.  Like the fact that it all meshes with my kindle fire so easily."

Spotify,Mostly Amazing App!,Amazon Customer,28-May-17,4,I like this music app! It lets you create your own play lists with any music you want and like. The only thing I don't like about this app is that they make you pay to listen to music without WiFi.

If you purchase premium you can download the music and enjoy ad - free listening. The app runs smoothly. One thing I would suggest doing is stopping the music after a few hours because sometimes I will fall asleep with music on and wake up to it playing
Spotify,Spotify,Dman,19-Apr-17,5,I love this app. It let's me choose what songs or artists I want and I can go to radio and broadcasts.

Spotify,"Potential, but it Sucks",Gary Pollard,11-Feb-17,1,"This service has great potential to be amazing, but streaming music is a nightmare sometimes. Even with an excellent connection and new device, the app is obnoxiously buggy. That, and they get commercial happy if you don't make your payment. They're not even relevant commercials! Just background noise to annoy you into buying their subscription!"
Spotify,Awesome!,Amazon Customer,12-Feb-16,5,"Great! I can get music I could get on Amazon Music and iTunes. The only thing I don't like about it, is you can't choose what song you want to listen to. If you have say, 5 songs on a playlist you created, click shuffle play, you can listen to those 5 songs. Awesome. But it also plays &#34;recommended songs&#34; or songs from the album you got your chosen songs from!"
Spotify,Just as great as the new iPhone version,Yousef A. Reda,30-Oct-14,5,I love the new interface that Spotify has designed with their mobile apps - mostly very intuitive and genuinely beautiful with their use of album art and photos in the backgrounds. The way the now playing panel appears in the notification pull down is gorgeous and rounds out a great music listening experience on my Kindle. I just wish it were caught up to whatever Amazon's security standards are because the pop up warning prior to opening it every time is a tad bit annoying.

Spotify,Great app / significant gaps in available content,David,9-Oct-16,4,"The app is one of the better (both functionally and looking) apps that I've seen and although the available music is huge, there are a surprising number of tracks not available.  I was hoping that Spotify could replace other apps and ripped CDs, but it doesn't for me."

Spotify,sad,anoroc 1,5-Nov-15,2,"I used to love this app  but the new update makes me sad. I can only shuffle to play songs, there are way more commercials and it always tells me I'm not connected to the Internet when I really am. These are all reasons I left pandora and came to spotify."

Spotify,The Best.,Ethan Schaffer,22-Dec-16,5,"Spotify + Amazon Echo = frictionless musical bliss. Spotify is by far the best interface for curation and discovery.

Spotify,Who needs any other music service?,Willoughby,31-Jul-14,5,"To start, I was impressed with the free service. The music quality was pretty good. But the music selection was amazing! Just about everything I want is here. So, I figured &#34;sure, why not go for the premium service?&#34; The quality is even better AND now I can remotely control my tablet (hooked up to my sound system) with my cell phone! The first month is free. Highly recommended, folks. Go for it!"

Spotify,Spotift Music vs.I  heart radio,MILTON M. MORGAN,15-Nov-14,5,This app is a million times better because on I heart radio they dont play music that you want example you want something by Katy Perry the first song that they play is by Katy Perry the second song is by like Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber. With Spotify  is different because you can look by the artist album to know which song you like Spotify is awesome you should really download this app :)
Spotify,WHAT A FANTASTIC APP!,Kindle Customer,18-Mar-15,5,"I read constantly and I always look for the free music and comedy apps that will &#34;follow&#34; me as I jump from one to the other.

Spotify,Okay app,W V S,23-Feb-15,3,"The app is good, but soon after downloading it mysteriously baloons up from the listed 20 MB to 60-100 after downloading, even if you don't download anything, which is annoying if you're trying to save space. Other music apps don't do this."
Spotify,Spotify,Maximum Ride,10-Mar-15,4,"Spotify is an amazing app. It has all the songs I can think of. Even if I forget the title of a song I can just type in a few lyrics of the song, and it'll pop up for me to listen to. Spotify is amazing and without music there isn't life is what I say."
Spotify,Great music app,Meaghan White,11-Jun-15,5,I pay 10$ a month for the premium and I must say it's worth it. I can download music and listen to it whenever and wherever I am. There is no limit to the amount of music I can have or the playlists. I can share my music with friends or keep my playlist hidden for my own personal use. I love this app.
Spotify,Good one,sateesh,17-Jul-17,4,Liked it - use it for kids songs
Spotify,More than good!,Nicole Spencer-Phillips,21-Mar-16,5,Oh my gosh this music app Spotify is so good!

Spotify,"TRY IT, YOU WON'T KNOCK IT!!!",Amazon Customer,5-Jan-17,5,"This is the best, especially for those of us that are computor slow.  I have never requested a song that Spotify could not supply.  It easy to make and arrange music lists..I can't compliment it enough..The perodic up grades simply make it better. I believe I have sold a few subscriptions just as my son sold it to me."
Spotify,it is a good music app,D. Dulin,6-Aug-15,4,"Gave '4' stars only because,  It wont change album artwork anymore  as you listen.But, it is a good music app,  does seem to be periodic skip's in music, That's why I'm a little hesitant to go premium"

Spotify,Awesome for mobile streaming,AmazonCustomer,23-Aug-16,5,I've used Spotify ever since it came out years ago to stream music while in the car or on my motorcycle. I rarely ever even listen to the radio anymore. The ability to custom build playlists or search through other people's playlist is awesome. Being able to follow artists' pages is great for keeping up with new releases. I'd be lost without this app.

There's only one issue that I have and it's so worthless it doesn't even deserve to have a star taken off, but how come on the website it says that Premium's only for the phone and my Kindle should have it automatically? My Kindle is able to skip songs and choose any song but it has ads and I can't play My Songs music offline."
Spotify,Great app but even greater if it had a non-profanity switch,Duran,21-Jul-17,3,Not really with all the cursing in songs when I'm with my kids. Wish there was a switch to turn off the profanity when I'm with them in the car.

Spotify,Very good but one thing.,MY LITTLE PONY LOVER,9-Jan-15,5,I love this app. It's works very well and when I'm bored i just go on this app and listen. There's just one problem. Sometimes when I look at the music that i got it crashes and then I can never get back on app. I keep downloading it over and over and over and over and over again . It gets very frustrating. Is it possible if you can fix that?

Spotify,WAY better than Pandora!,Avalon Iyem,25-Nov-14,4,Only one flaw with this on the kindle version vs. the app on my android tablet is that it will look like you have added a song/saved a song but it does not in fact save at all. I've had to go back and forth from my droid to kindle.This is basically exactly like google play and cost the same to go add free.

Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just don't enjoy lessening to the radio that's just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and don't mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app.

Spotify,Not what I thought it would be...,Sarah,10-Jun-14,2,"When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I'm just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".).You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."

Spotify,Kindle fires are tablets!!!,lovelysmiles,7-Nov-15,1,"I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can't do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the ""tablet"" version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky ""mobile"" version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones. Spotify was great. Please fix this!! I don't understand why kindles are considered different than every other tablet."

After playing around with it for a bit I decided to exit the app and do something else.... but couldn't find a way to exit the app! I ended up having to turn off my kindle fire to make it stop playing music. I think the creators had good intentions but there are a lot of bugs that need fixing."

Spotify,Very good for an Amazon app,AlknightGamer,13-May-16,5,Spotify is a very very well made app to listen to music on. When you turn on Pandora you deal with advertisements and more. With Spotify advertisements are almost non-existent. The only thing that does need to be implemented is a setting to turn off or take out swear words. All in all this app is a very good app and I recommend this app to anyone who wants some music in their day.

I'm using the free premium trial for now, and will probably pay for it when it runs out. Just as an FYI: to make music available offline you MUST have the space in your phone. Don't sign up for premium because of that perk without having the extra space."

Spotify,No need to modify Spotify.,Richard Linyear,9-Jan-17,4,"I've been enjoying this app. What you can't find probably hasn't been created yet. On the downside of not purchasing the premium package is the fact that you can't hear the specific song you've been dying to listen to all day. Nevertheless, It's worth the time and space on your device."
Spotify,Free,amazonian,10-Nov-17,3,If you want to see what sounds like your music.
Spotify,Enjoyable,Ian M.,20-Dec-15,4,"I really love Spotify my choice for any music player. Better than Pandora actually! It's an all around great app. So it's a must get if your really into music. But the Only thing that grinds my gears is the ads like three ads that all last 30 seconds. So you listen to music for around 20 minutes and these ads play, but all you have to do is pay to get premium."
Spotify,Five Stars,Deborah Belcher,9-Mar-17,5,Awesome app
Spotify,Wish I hadn't paid,Jenkypoo,8-Jul-16,2,"I had been using this app for free for a year and finally paid for a subscription so I could listen to my playlists while camping. It worked great for several days, but on the day we went to come home the app logged itself out and required internet to log back in. It took an hour of our 6 hour trip to find WiFi, and then most of my songs were not showing as downloaded anymore. Very frustrating! It's been a month since then, and today all my songs are gone again! I won't be renewing my subscription."

Spotify,Great,Frederic Braun,6-Mar-16,4,"Spotify is far superior to other music apps, it has the radio feature that lets you explore songs similar to those that you like as well as the playlist and album feature that lets you play specific songs.The kindle version does not require you to do shuffle play, but it is still available."
Spotify,Great streaming app,D.Bruce,30-Apr-17,5,"Great streaming app! Better than Pandora. Free is also a great thing. Check it out... Needtobreathe, John Mark McMillan, it's all good."

Spotify,Spotify,starla yost,13-Oct-15,3,"I love being able to listen to anything on Spotify including the latest hits...

Spotify,Better than Pandora!,Manuel Alvarez,15-Mar-16,5,"I (my mom) used to use Pandora but it only played random songs but Spotify only plays the songs that you download(for free) .

Spotify,great app,Sadly,23-Dec-15,5,"I love spotify so much. It works much like pandora in which you can create a radio station of an artist to discover new music. However, you can also find a certain song and save it into 'your music' and play it anytime you want where there's WiFi, for free. Overall, it's a great app and definitely worth the download."
Spotify,Good app for listening to old songs.,Cringe.,4-Apr-17,5,"I mainly downloaded this app to listen to music from the Beatles, the rolling stones, etc.Very good due to the fact that it has the remastered editions, 5/5."
Spotify,good at first,Tyler McDonald,2-Apr-16,1,You have to pay money to actually pick songs to listen too. Otherwise you have to shuffle your playlist and risk having to listen too a random song they recommend. I'm leaving this app alone till I get money. And you should too.
Spotify,Great Spotify,somebody,3-Oct-15,4,"I like this app I don't have premium, but I do still like it. If you just want to listen to music for free it's great. They have a great selection of songs. The ads aren't bad and they aren't that long, so I don't pay for the premium, but I have heard that people say the premium is worth it. All in all its a great app."

Spotify,A great way to get at the music you like.,Amazon Customer,16-Jun-15,5,"This is a great way to not only stay up-to-date with your favourite music stars/groups/composers, but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones.

Spotify,This...app...is...sick.,Matt Anthony Wilson,26-Feb-15,5,"All, I'll say is this is app is amazing beyond belief, I'm in shock that it exists...and for free.  And in addition to practically any song, full album, or artist you can think of...new releases drop the same day as any paid store.Without saying too much, using it on a tablet is EVEN BETTER due to some really nice perks that you usually have to pay for."

Spotify,Having access to anything and everything without the guilt associated with stealing artists' intellectual property is always nic,Jake,28-Dec-14,5,Very thorough collection of music.  Having access to anything and everything without the guilt associated with stealing artists' intellectual property is always nice.

Spotify,Spotify is an awesome music app which allows you to do stuff pandora ...,killroy353,21-Mar-15,5,Spotify is an awesome music app which allows you to do stuff pandora doesn't usually allow you to do. You can make your own playlist and if your using a kindle or a computer you can play any music you want as much as you want.Though the only downside is you can't download it for offline if your not a premium member you can get the best quality if your a premium.
Spotify,Three Stars,Steven J  Podhurst,28-Jan-17,3,ok
Spotify,Four Stars,sandipan,2-Nov-17,4,All performance wise it's perfect. But it would be great if it has Alexa support.
Spotify,Spotify rocks but it has problems,N.B. Jones,21-Nov-15,2,Spotify is wonderful but there's a huge problem. When enabling music to play offline it causes all downloaded music to be stored in your internal storage bank which fills up extremely quickly. The lack of option to move the storage to an SD cards means very minimal download space. I love Spotify but this is just a terrible side of this app. Hopefully they fix it soon.
Spotify,Really amazing,Avery,23-May-17,5,"This app is wonderful. I really love it. Though I don't have premium or any other upgrades, I can say with certainty that even with out those, it's still amazing. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes music."

Spotify,love this app,Amazon Customer,23-Oct-15,4,"So far this has been the best way for me to listen to music. I like that the have the offline mode for premium members, it definitely saves my data when I'm on the go. The only downside that I've found is the lack of songs available for certain artist but that is to be expected."
Spotify,music-lover's heaven!,josephine menorca,3-Apr-16,5,"I've only tried the free version but even with this, you can't go wrong. You'll be listening for a while before you hear any commercials, and then they only last seconds. They are certainly more tolerable than radio commercials. And, I've found just about any type of music that I searched for."
Spotify,Relaxing,Evanator,19-Sep-17,5,"I think this is a great app because I can chill with my friends and listen to all kinds of music. I like queen, beatles, citizen king, and more!"
Spotify,Good,Jared M,6-Jan-15,4,It would be beneficial if the phone had done way to see the music that is local to the device so that it could be used in 3rd party alarm apps. It would also be nice if there was a way to auto play a playlist or resume the playlist/radio on asp open.
Spotify,Nice!,Amazon Customer,29-Jul-17,5,Spotify has all of the old school music and the new school music.
Spotify,Curate your daily soundtrack!,Dawna Wright,24-Jun-17,4,Great platform for curating a play list and discovering new artists!
Spotify,"ok, idk",Nia C. Hall,24-Jul-17,3,"This app is the same as Pandora. I think you can listen free without WiFi, but you need a premium account to do that .& I'm pretty sure that costs MONEY. SO I STILL LIKE IT But u won't get to enjoy it for free. That is the.ONLY reason I downloaded this app because I thought I could listen for the $free.99 (without WiFi).  it is a little tricky at first. It slow too."

I would recommend anyone who loves listening to all types of music and want it just a click away this is for you.
Spotify,The best their is,Amazon Customer,9-Feb-16,5,"I had Pandora and the iHeart radio app, but neither compare to Spotify. Unlimited skips, huge library of music, and great quality sound. But Spotify Premium is even better. Download songs and listen to them without WiFi/cell service. Only have had one problem; a glitch with the app mot letting me sign in, but was fixed. Besides that, best music app there is."
Spotify,I love being able to stream albums and individual songs vs,Austin H,15-May-15,4,"I love being able to stream albums and individual songs vs. just building a radio station around an artist, album, or song."
Spotify,It needs fixed,Amazon Customer,26-Mar-17,3,I like this app but I keep making aPlay list but it transfers to the radio and gives me songs that I don't like in all it is good but if the fix this problem it would be 100times better.

Spotify,Great.,Cara N.,10-Sep-15,4,"I really love Spotify. Great playlists, great variety, reasonable ad interruptions for the free version. I use this over Pandora, Amazon music and several others. My one complaint: occasionally the music won't play on my Kindle fire. I can not figure out an explanation. There seems to be no rhyme or reason that I can identify or that is consistent."
Spotify,A great radio app!!!!!,Amazon Customer,4-Aug-14,5,"This is the very best radio on the web.  You can pick an artist and it will play only music from that artist!!  Therefor, you truly listen to what you want...COOL.....  There was only one thing I don't like, commercials but they are short and spaced nice. So, this app gets a 5 star...... to the app writers and all involved in this app........keep up the good work!!!!  THANK YOU!!!!!"

Spotify,it works,Aimbot,13-Oct-16,3,it works
Spotify,If it worked it would be great,Seraph,17-Mar-15,1,"Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just won't play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50% of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50% of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though.Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."
Spotify,spodify is amazing!,TASHA PHAN,8-Apr-17,5,"Spodify is a really awesome app. It lets you pick from tons of music stations, and you can also make your own. And if you listen to it on your computer you can pick any song you want to listen to. I really recommend it to anyone who loves music!"
Spotify,Love it,Kindle Customer,4-Jun-17,5,"I LOVE IT!!! So many great songs, many great playlists, and.... ITS ALL FREE.  If you get premium thers more great stuff!! GET IT NOW!!"
Spotify,No good on Samsung Galaxy 5,CMcGhee,27-Oct-14,1,"The app will not work on my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone.  Spotify has tried to help me, but this is a known issue on this phone.  They want me to pull my SIM card, but that requires me opening my Otter Box etc. and it is just not worth the trouble.  I do use them on the computer, and it works great.  Really SAD that I cannot use this app on my phone."
Spotify,Good App,Amazon Customer,9-Nov-17,4,Cant go wrong when it comes to music apps. I just wish it were less expensive. $9.99 a month is overpriced.

Spotify,The only music app you need,Mentlegen Trollface,3-Jan-16,5,"Title says it all. Pandora maybe great, but it has nothing on Spotify. The ability to pick and choose your songs is in of itself amazing, but add on the fact they have these custom made playlists with almost all types of genres from Today's Pop to 60s and from Rap to Concentrated Scratch. This app truly is a music lovers choice."
Spotify,"Ok, but . . .",Rp,4-Oct-17,3,"How come when I use the app on my tablet (Kindle Fire) I can play any song I want, but when I use my phone, the songs have to be shuffled? It's great on the tablet, but on the phone I may as well use Pandora, which has an eadier-to-use interface. Make the phone work like the tablet, and you'll get 5 stars."

Pfeiffer,6-Jan-15,5,"The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium."

Spotify,It's free And awesome!,Samuel  Williams,21-Aug-14,5,"As soon as there is room in my budget I'll get Spotify Premium, great service since they added the mobile capabilities. Very easy to listen to a specific artist, unlike other streaming services. Has helped prepare me for many a concert. And for road trips, the sci fi radio dramas are unbeatable!"
Spotify,Now Officially Ruined and Doesn't Even Deserve One Star!!!,Michelle Taylor,10-Sep-15,1,"I dont know if it was the update or not but now the only way you can listen to anything on spotify is by clicking shuffle, you cant pick anything anymore. I wished they wouldn't have screwed with anything!"
Spotify,What else do you want....,JDuh,9-Jun-16,5,Just about any music anytime you want...anywhere you are...and less ads than the radio...
Spotify,Spotify,LibrarianOnTheLoose,22-May-16,5,Best music service ever.
Spotify,I LOVE THIS APP. :),Melinda Baker,2-Jun-16,5,THIS APP HAS ALL THE MUSIC U WANT AND NEED.
Spotify,Premium definitely NOT worth it,Maintenance Guy,31-Mar-16,2,"Don't waste your money on the Premium!!!  Had it for almost a year...- could NEVER get ""My Songs"" to play correctly (using 2 different laptops and three different Android phones in that time).  Some would play, wome would just not and whenever they would come up it would stop the entire shuffle....and then they would play the next time through....- Making play lists and saving things for Offline use is a pain in the ass!!- The ""artists like this"" or ""songs like this"" function is no better than Pandora (and I've never paid for that premium service""I went to Spotify because Itunes is a pain....but honestly it's no worse...plus had I stayed there, I would actually OWN all the songs I've found on Spotify in the last year!"
Spotify,A top notch app,Jocelyne Sol Gonzalez,17-Mar-16,4,Downloading this app was a great idea in my part. The app ( like pandora) had a variety of both music and radio stations. But this one allows the listeners to have a choice on what to pick. So if you wish to have a bit of music in your life than downlaod this app.
Spotify,Totally enjoyed it needed to read a few times then it hits freedom,Kindle Customer,30-Aug-17,5,"Elaine's poetry brings my mind to the peace and healing of the land she shares,with nature.the freedom to see who you areThe old look at your self was there. Before. Mem"
Spotify,Yep. It works.,Dillon Burnett,29-Mar-16,5,This app works just like it does on other platforms. Correctly.
Spotify,Great for discovery,Hayden Hallgren,12-Feb-17,5,Almost all of my favorite music in one place I can take anywhere. Also a powerful tool for discovering new favorites. Unfortunately they've dumbed down the social features and the app can be glitchy. Still deserves 5 stars.
Spotify,"A little better than Pandora Plus, but twice the price.",r. krueger,18-Feb-15,3,"It is great that you can pick your songs and play them over and over (unlike pandora) but $10 a month is bordering expensive if you, like me, like to have 10 apps that have a monthly charge. It all adds up. Even though I like this app, because it is more than twice the price of Pandora Plus, I will likely cancel it in the future. Pandora is easier to use and works for about everything I need it for."
Spotify,So good,Charles R. Willis Jr,19-Jul-17,5,It has lot of song _Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ˜˜
Spotify,Really?!,Shad the Hedgehog,10-Mar-16,1,"Do you seriously have to pay $10 a month just to listen to music?! I mean for premium?! I mean, you could just pay once and not have to pay $10 a month, but that is just impossible!!!!!"

Spotify,Just try it!!!!!,Zachary Derouen,21-May-17,5,Its reputation speaks for itself. Easy to use and customize. Organized in such a way so that you can spend less time researching new music and more time enjoying it. Five stars. Great investment.
Spotify,Good but update ruined it.,SUCKS,10-Sep-15,4,This app was Good and you could make your own playlist and fast forward when you like. But now with the new update everything is pretty much the same except now your not able to fast forward and for certain songs all there is are covers. Which stinks because if you were able to fast forward unlimitedly I would rate this a 5 and more.
Spotify,My favorite music streaming app!,K. Stuckey,12-Sep-14,5,"I love making playlist on my PC and listening to them on my iPhone. I have lists for running, camping, driving, chilling, pretty much anything. Sure there are ads in the free version, but you have to decide for yourself if it is worth ponying up money to skip commercials and listen to music on demand. It is still way fewer breaks than FM radio and I don't mind my playlists shuffled."
Spotify,Lifesaver!,Anastasia Exterovich,6-Nov-15,5,"This is an awesome app!!! When I found out that I couldn't get music on my kindle without paying for it I was bummed but then my friend told me about spotify so I decided to try it,I am so glad I did! You have to put in some personal information, but from then on it is totally free.  THANK YOU SPOTIFY!"

Spotify,Awesome listening Variety,Malik Koates,26-May-17,4,"The app has a lot of genres of music to choose from, but sometimes the ads get to be a bit much. Sometimes the ads will break the flow of the app because it got stuck loading but never loads."
Spotify,the new update,jjrrll,11-Sep-15,2,"This new up date sucks now spotify is like Pandora but you can add all your favorite songs. You have a skip limit unless you pay to be a member, you can't have songs on repeat unless your a member, and you can pick the songs you want to play u must use shuffle unless you are a member. Spotify change back other wise more people might go to Pandora."
Spotify,Best app,Tony,16-Aug-17,5,Awesome love it!!!!!
Spotify,Perfect,Joan M,10-Aug-15,5,This app is the best to listen to your music. Pandora isn't good if you don't have an email. This is the best app you can get to listen to your music when you want.

Spotify,"PC and Android App is fragile, slow, and hangs often. Spotify also does not have a functioning random number generator.",avery,1-Mar-17,2,"PC and android apps are slow, fragile, and hang often. They also do not understand what random play means."
Spotify,It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if ...,Cal M. MacDonald,19-Jul-17,4,It would be far better and I would give it a perfect rating if it had more free use instead of most of it being premium features that have to be paid for. I'm not paying money to use an app.  Sorry ain't happening. What should have been free is the ability to make a playlist and also search for actual songs and play just single songs and that stuff isn't fee.  It's a good app but it's not the best especially for those folks who don't have spare money to waste.
Spotify,Good,Gabriela,25-Sep-17,5,This app is very dependable it always works and you can listen to music whenever you want
Spotify,Free music,Amazon Customer,3-May-17,5,free music.

Spotify,better than pandora?,Christian Barnhart,10-Sep-15,3,"I really like both spotify and pandora, but I love the option of different folders on spotify. Although my spotify seems to freeze a lot and when I restart it the same songs play over again then I get frustrated and turn it off. Annoying when in the shower or working out."

Spotify,Awesome,Michael Lake,19-Aug-15,5,"Normally, with this kind of app you can't put custom songs into one playlist like iheartradio or pandora, so since this app allows you to do that along with what iheartradio and pandora (not mentioning a few others), it is definitely the best music app to have."
Spotify,Love!,Jennifer Jacques,26-Aug-17,5,Love listening to my music. Getting is membership is worth it! Download playlists and listen to them without WiFi.

I was able to cancel sat radio and limit my streaming on my cell with spotify.  I took advantage of the student price for my subscription.  The only issue I have is that I listen to a wide range of music.  One of my favorite genre is kpop.  I am not able to find much to download.

I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month.  That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time.  I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."

Spotify,"good, but not as good as it is on apple devices",sarahwestor,3-Aug-14,3,"While I love spotify, this app has a few glitches. Sometimes when I play a song, it won't have any sound, which gets rather irritating after a while. I also have found that spotify on apple devices (iPad, iPhone) is extremely better to navigate and easier to use. If kindle can make the layout more like that, I would change the rating to 5 stars."
Spotify,I like it but I hate it too,seetangalie,10-Sep-15,1,"I love this app for its wide selection on free music, but I hate the way it works. Why do I have to pay money for me to be able to hear the songs I want to hear when I want to!?! Since the last update for the kindle version, I have to click shuffle to go through EVERY song I saved to find the one I want to hear. Thats just ridiculous. I think i'll find an app that I can listen to music that I want to hear. Ha! Forget it im going back to pandora!"

Spotify,gapless continuation!!!!!,peter,6-Apr-15,5,Finally an app that has an option to take away the gaps between songs. So when you finish one the next one starts right away.  It also has a crossover fade to easily transition between songs as well.  Amazing app.  And not to mention the offline mode... genius!!!!
Spotify,Balancing Positives and Negatives,Alice Burrows,16-Oct-14,4,"I think this app is brilliant , it has a Apple look to it and I use it all the time. That being said I only scored it 4/5 and this is because you have to have  a internet connection to use it luckily I have a kindle and I don't take it out much, but I wouldn't be able to use it on a phone for this reason."
Spotify,really spotify?,Tara Koomen,17-Sep-15,1,"I was amazed with spotify at first, i could skip all the songs i eanted and i could play whatever song i wanted even without permium.Then i got the update... i am highly frustrated with the new update you can only skip a few songs and cant play the songs you want. Spotify WAS better than pandora but not anymore."
Spotify,Amazing!,Aareia,28-Aug-16,5,This app is amazing! I can listen to countless songs that I really like. Its similar to Pandora except you actually choose the song you listen too. I love it!
Spotify,LOVE IT BUT,Terra B.,28-May-16,4,Love it but threads are what's getting the app
Spotify,Simply The BEST...,iPACâ„¢,8-Oct-15,5,I'll make this review easy to read and simply say that Spotify is the best paid for or free with ads music service. It's easy and dark UI is easy to understand and nativate. You'll love the crossfade feature and use it every song. Try out the best money (or no money) can get you. SPOTIFY!
Spotify,Rylee Alexander,Hollee,3-Feb-17,5,I love Spotify. Whether you heard a song yesterday or when you were a kid Spotify has it. _Ÿ_€It is very convenient it has a shuffle feature and you can create albums.

Spotify,Opens a world of new music,jim b,5-Nov-17,5,Introduces lots of artists that are new.So there is music beyond classic rock that is great but i just hadn't been exposed.
Spotify,Love this app,April,19-Dec-16,4,Love this app. Get to listen to all my favorite songs on one list. My only issue is it seems to freeze more often then i'd like. I restart my phone and that doesn't fix it. I use it in my car with bluetooth and after so long it  randomly pauses and i have to open it up while driving just to unpause it. Other then thoes issues. I love that you can just listen to the songs you like and not just the type of music.
Spotify,Turtles,Tammie Gerard,14-Nov-15,4,I like it a lot but the only thing that is bothering me is that I am not able to pick my own songs to listen to. If I click the song the shuffle play box pops out at me so I click it and it plays a whole entire different song. I also can't skip the song when it comes on.
Spotify,Best music app out there!,Charles Irby,5-Jan-15,5,"Wish I could have had this year's ago. I love the discover feature that suggest new albums. Better selection than other apps, and more hard to find artists than I could have ever imagined in an app. Never crashes, and uses very little data."
Spotify,Amazing app,Karen Hopkins,1-Sep-17,5,All of my favorite music whenever wherever it awesome I definitely recommend this app
Spotify,don't update,just an ordinary girl,13-Sep-15,3,"I updated Spotify a few days ago, and now you have limited skips. When I first got this app I liked it because it wasn't like any other music app. You could choose and skip any song you wanted but if you update it takes that away. I hope it turns back to normal soon."

Spotify,Better then iHeart radio!,Hailey,13-Jan-15,5,This is far better then iHeart Radio because if you tap on a certain song in that app then it'll open an album that has mixed music that doesn't even have the same artist's songs. I deleted iHeart Radio right when I played my favourite songs. This is amazing!!!
Spotify,AWESOME!!!!,Athena Dedow,26-Jun-15,5,"This is such a great thing to use for music, better than Pandora in my opinion! Choose your own music from tons of different songs. The only down side is the ads but that is okay! Choose Spotify Music and you can listen to your music all the time."
Spotify,I love spotify!,Beth Brink,2-Apr-15,5,It has all of the music I love plus you can find just about anything just by searching. Falling to sleep to the nature sounds or thunder and rain has made me sleep much better. Waking up to my favorite tunes or discovering new favorites in the morning before work is priceless.

Spotify,Annoying,Chris lyday,28-Jul-17,1,Spotify has tons of great music but when you go to different apps while listening to a song it stops playing and you have to go back to the app. Also those ads that are supposed to give 30 minutes of add free music play almost after every song you listen to.

No instructions given.  And every time that I go to another computer to try and add my five choices all that is provided prompts me to sign up for a trial membership for Spotify Premium well that is what I already purchased and paid for which is Spotify Premium so that leaves us customers in a wicked Loop nowhere are we fine provided instructions on how to load the product onto the five computers and Spotify Keeps Us in a loop referring us constantly to the trial membership which of course if I press that will charge me again which means double the membership price I would really appreciate some help with this dilemma thank you much

Spotify,Five Stars,Stephanie Linden,8-Feb-15,5,Super macht total spass
Spotify,Free is terrible.,Alec,14-Sep-15,1,"The premium is nice but the free version requires you to shuffle songs, which would be fine if it played more than two songs of the album or playlist that you wanted to shuffle before playing nothing but suggested songs for a while, and with only a couple opportunities to &#34;skip&#34;. So now you rarely listen to what you want (which is the point of music streaming), certainly rarely any particular song. You will be alarmed to try listening to Hozier only to instead become bombarded with suggested songs that you skip, so that you're out of skips when &#34;All About that Bass&#34; inexplicably appears to assault you with no escape."

Spotify,"KINDLE FIRE IS A TABLET SO ANY SONG, RIGHT? NOPE!!!! STUCK WITH SHUFFLE",JOE,26-Aug-15,1,"The functionality of this app is fine and I really enjoy Spotify, but how gimmicky is it to offer any song listening on tablets and desktops but exclude Fires as tablets, which was a strong point of me getting this tablet. I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go &#34;premium&#34; or relegate us to &#34;shuffle&#34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE. SPOTIFY IS NOT HONEST IN ADVERTISEMENT."
