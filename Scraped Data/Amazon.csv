Amazon,I like it better than Pandora.,mob,28-Mar-16,5,"love this music app.  great selection.  Better than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone.  Not happy, however, that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App,  (Amazon, if someone could contact me about this, would greatly appreciated)  The Amazon Cloud app does not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app.....Thanks!"
Amazon,In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it's just not worth payhing a year in advance for it.,William Davidson,30-Jun-16,3,Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this.  Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks.  Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again.  The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought.  But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon.
Amazon,"Amazon Music is great, I don't know why I didn't get it ...",Nolan,3-Oct-17,5,"Amazon Music is great , I don't know why I didn't get it sooner. love it."
Amazon,Glad to be able to get the music as a Prime member,L..Gerry,27-Apr-16,4,"Love that you can download music as a Amazon Prime Member.  Just was a little confusing for me when it asked certain questions on where to store songs and also if there was a charge for the songs. That is the only reason I did 4 stars.  I am not quite as tech savy as some of the younger people, so just would have liked a little more explanation.  Love having the music though."
Amazon,Five Stars,jan0019,10-Apr-17,5,works great
Amazon,Not happy,Kirby,17-Aug-15,1,"In addition to the ridiculous list of things it wants access to, this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It kept logging me in under my mother, even when I put my own email and password in multiple times. She doesn't have Amazon Prime or any of my music, so all the music I just saved to my library apparently is now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify.  At least that's a lot easier to use and lets me log in to my own profile."
Amazon,Amazon does it again!,Rebecca Combs,17-Jun-15,5,"This has been a great benefit of being a prime member. Its has almost infinite playlists and music geared towards everyone and everything. I love the thumb up thumbs down options that allow you to make your preferences known, plus the ability to download whole albums or just single songs. It brings up new artists you might like and has stations for whole genres or just specific artists that also play their musical colleagues. Great product or service from amazon. AGAIN!"

Amazon,Loving the selection so far!,Paula Rivers,2-May-16,5,"Just started using Amazon music but so far I am really liking it! I was easily able to find music that I liked and out it where I can listen to only what I want to listen to! Lots to choose from and I have barely begun to look! My only issue is that now my son is asking me non-stop for my phone so he can listen too! As long as he stays in my country world, all will be well!"
Amazon,Not bad considering its free!,Saul Castillo,20-Jun-14,4,Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed.

Amazon,fiddle-y and annoying. Maybe it's better from my Chromebook,Kaye,19-Jun-17,2,"Tweaky, kept having to back out of the app to change stations, fiddle-y and annoying.  Maybe it's better from my Chromebook, but on my phone the app was a PITA and I probably won't use it."

Amazon,BETTER THAN ITUNES!,Amazon Customer,2-Dec-16,5,AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!
Amazon,Avoid this at all costs.,Paulette,20-Dec-16,1,"I gave it one star because I could not give it zero. Nothing works on this system. The help desk is not useful either (although they tried), and the software is anything but user friendly. I would pass this up, along with ECHO which is the worst purchase I ever made. Do not take it even if offered for free."
Amazon,Amazon music for Android,Amazon Customer,2-Jun-17,2,"I plan to work with it a little more, but so far am not impressed. Too complex.

Amazon,It's nice that comes for free but not as good as other music streaming services,Mdobber22,7-Sep-16,3,"It's okay they have a pretty good music selection, that's my expense or at least with the music listen to Spotify it has more options YouTube Red has even more, but YouTube can be annoying because the videos take up a lot of space if you're saving them offline. But its nice that this comes with prime because I would get Prime anyways."
Amazon,Best part of Prime!,ZeldaBarbie99,6-Nov-15,5,"Best thing for my morning walks with a busy baby and wild husky. I download songs at home before I leave so I don't get charged data by my wireless carrier. For the price of FREE the music selection is amazing. I have music for working out, morning walks, putting my baby to bed, studying, calming anxiety attacks, and music to get me though long road trips! As long as Amazon keeps this feature we will keep purchasing Prime!"

I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I don't have a gaming device.

Amazon,Works for me!,Only Grace,15-Nov-16,4,"Works well on my smart phone. Not comparing it to itunes or any other provider As a stand alone  product, I use it with Audio CDs purchased and I can download with prime in 5 seconds.

Amazon,"Bad on a current device, but why would I put this on a current device?",JR,20-Aug-15,1,"I can't give negative stars, or else I would.  There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1.  The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player.  But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android.  Useless app.It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog.  I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."

Amazon,Best streaming music service I've found,David G.,9-Jul-15,5,"It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."

Amazon,"New update is broken **UPDATE** New, new update even more broken!",Jeremy,16-Dec-13,1,"I've used this app for nearly 2 years and it's been great. I love my Amazon cloud drive and have most of my music uploaded to the cloud drive. Unfortunately, the recent update to this app is broken. If you are listening to music and then go use another app (chrome, facebook, a game, etc.) then the music will randomly stop playing at some point. So, this app is great if you are only going to listen to music and not use your device for any other apps. I'm back to using the system music player for now. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.**UPDATE**I tried to create a new review, which doesn't work. Still only 1 star, though, since I can't give the app negative stars.The new Amazon MP3 app is essentially unusable. You've never been able to set the download location to download music to the SD card but at least with the old Amazon MP3 app you could copy downloaded music to the SDCard. This is such a fundamentally flawed design choice that it really makes me question amazon's focus on what customer's want. However, now it's even worse with this new piece of crap app which 1) keeps defaulting to using Prime Music when you open the app (which sucks - I just want to play my music) but, 2) even worse, when you download music and copy it to the SDCard it won't see your music even if it's in the same folder. I've also found, when I did briefly use this new version of the app, that it crashed pretty regularly.I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4.Oh well. At least the Google Music app continues to just work. Can I give that app a 5-star review on Amazon? ;)"

Amazon,Prime Music Needs Work,garrett,23-Jun-14,2,Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection is small and includes mostly older music. While it generally works OK for the music it does have I was unable to find any way to just search the music that is available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I went to listen to a song it was going to charge me.If you were able to limit the search and list of songs to only those available for free I would have given it a higher score but at the moment it was a lot more frustration than listening pleasure.

Amazon,"Great concept, wish it worked better",Amazon Customer,9-Jan-13,3,"I love the Amazon Cloud service, and I store my entire music library on it.  Unfortunately, my experience with it has been inconsistent and disappointing.  I have an iPhone, and if I use the app on there for more than about 5 minutes, it locks up my phone, and it can take a full minute for it to respond.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab, and for some reason, Amazon decided to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre.  That might not seem like a big deal for some people, but it's huge for me.  Really makes the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to.  I realize there are competition issues between Amazon and Apple, and Amazon and Google, but these inconsistencies and poor performance is a real let-down from Amazon."
Amazon,Usually Works Well,Candice,18-Mar-16,3,"This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."

Amazon,"Lacking content, but free",dreid,15-Jun-14,3,"Get free music from a service that you already pay for.  How can you not like it!!  The selection is a little scarce, but it's new, so I'm sure the selection will increase in time.  Seems that Amazon would put more effort in their prime video service (which is still very limited and lacks the selection of their competitors) instead of launching additional services.  Just seems a little backwards to me, but I won't complain about something free!!"
Amazon,"I know you are not listening, BUT",Amazon Customer,3-Jul-14,1,"For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment.  First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality.  This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you.  Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time.  Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want.  I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with.  Very dissapointed.  Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else.  Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy.  Good luck with your new fire products.  Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.  You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them.  You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."
Amazon,Not happy with Android app,Karmen M.,17-Jun-15,1,"I don't know what the core problem is, but I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 (AT&T) and I have another app that can track things like when apps restart multiple times, consuming resources like RAM memory, response time, and temperature, and for whatever reason, this and all the other Amazon apps have periods where they'll restart anywhere from 5 to 47 times in a 5 minute period. Amazon, you gotta fix this, it's not right to be slowing down a competitor's product."

Amazon,No lollipop support,Jason R. Protheroe,15-May-15,1,The app only works once per install on my 2nd Gen Moto X running lollipop. After a reboot the app consistently reports that my library is empty until I uninstall and reinstall. I'm not a novice user. I've checked my authorization limit. I've even reset my phone to factory defaults. Nothing fixes this app. The fact that this problem has existed for months now shows that Amazon is not committed to maintaining this app and therefore not maintaining their music service.

Amazon,Prime time,Ginger coe,25-Jun-16,5,"Amazon music is awesome! Since I am a prime member, I have free access to all kinds of great music. If you don't have amazon prime you should get it. The free shipping and music is definitely worth it!"
Amazon,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, you know the rest.",David,29-Aug-14,1,"Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."

Amazon,"Uninstalled, because it is of no use to me anymore",Pat H,2-Aug-14,1,"Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud'  music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me."

Amazon,no problem,EJB,29-Jan-16,5,I don't understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma :)
Amazon,Awful,Paul,19-Oct-15,1,I wish I could download purchased music directly to my phone. Instead I have to go through this disgusting app Amazon is stuffing down my throat.
Amazon,A great app to use on my android phone and tablet,JACKFORK,5-Dec-15,5,A great app to use on my android phone and tablet! I love that I can upload my personal library to it and listen to it when I'm on other devices then my computer.

Amazon,Great solid app with tons of features,Keith Dotter,25-Sep-16,5,Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps.
Amazon,Awesome music app,Kindle Customer,31-Jan-16,5,It asked me when I first tried to download where I want music stored. I chose sd card and that's where they're being stored. Anyone having difficulties may be using an earlier version. May want to uninstall and reinstall to see if that will help.
Amazon,Blown away!,Ashley Smiith,5-Sep-15,5,Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it's been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I'm stoked on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!
Amazon,Five Stars,Anthony Clark,9-Aug-15,5,I just love Amazon Music w/ Prime Music. Can't wait to see what the future holds.

Amazon,COULD be a 5 star...,Na Deela,30-Apr-15,3,"I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I don't get that. since then, it's happening more and more frequently. Whether I'm home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I'm disappointed I had to go back to Pandora."
Amazon,Nothing to write home about.,Nathan K.,18-Jun-16,2,"Its a decent bonus, but its no replacement for anybof my other music apps. The 1st 3 songs I tried to find werent in the collection, and the app doesn't play well withy android platform. I deleted it."
Amazon,Worst update ever!!!,Melanie Fisher,18-Jun-14,1,"This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely.  I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want.  Too many drop down menus, and too may ads.  And I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want.  Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
Amazon,Five Stars,Amy Mowry,23-Oct-17,5,Great!
Amazon,Best Music App Ever!!!,Amazon Customer,30-Apr-17,5,"This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."

Amazon,I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true,Ms. Chocolate,30-Mar-15,1,"I should have know Amazon Prime (Music/Kindle/Video) was too good to be true! Like Netflix, RedBox and any of the others like it, there are always loopholes/limitations. Every movie, song, book I've tried to download, it wasn't included in the Prime package.  I can just as easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same applies to music/videos.  Looks like the only thing that I'm going to benefit from by purchasing Prime is the free shipping for my Christmas shopping."

Amazon,"Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts.",Symbatine,12-Aug-14,1,"We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device (yes, we know only 1 device at time). However, the shuffle doesn't really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts."

Amazon,"Move Over iTunes, there's a new kid on the block.",M. R. Schulz,26-Oct-16,5,When I started looking at what was available it was like a time machine. There was my musical youth. I've found most of the albums I wore out in the 60's and 70's. All available to download into my tab and they're free with Amazon Prime. Move over iTunes there's a new and better alternative. Can't beat Free.
Amazon,Amazon Music App is the Best In Its Class.,Preston Mitchell,15-Jan-16,5,"I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials.  Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate.  Immense library of music.  Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices.  Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app.  Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!"
Amazon,Can't remove only the duplicate songs.,Reddie Henderson,1-Jan-17,4,"Very cool, but there's no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."

Amazon,... song of every musician out there which kind of sucks. However,Amazon Customer,24-Sep-16,4,"It is doesn't have every song of every musician out there which kind of sucks. However, I do like the prime station and I like that I can add a song to make my own playlist. The other down side to this though is that when you listen to a prime station you can't go back to see what the previous songs and artist are."

Amazon,The Worst Amazon Product Ever,jaydro,13-Apr-16,1,"If I could give this app negative stars, I would.I have been a longtime Amazon customer (since the '90's). When the Amazon MP3 app came out, it was great. There were free daily MP3's, and I bought quite a bit of music from my phone. Then in updates it would become sluggish, but then you'd get a new (Android) phone and it would be okay. But then there was the change to Amazon Music, and the authentication scheme Amazon came up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon apps (Shopping and Kindle). It became unusable on my last phone. When I got my current phone I tried it again, and it worked for maybe a month, before it suddenly decided that my phone had been registered to someone else and I could not access my cloud library or Prime Music.Amazon Customer Support for this is pretty much non-existent--they will only talk to you on the phone, and then they'll tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstalling EVERYTHING, which is ridiculous.I recently tried the app again, and it was miraculously working for no obvious reason (though the Kindle app would then keep asking me to re-login), but with this most recent update it is now once again broken for me--it gives me a network error, so I tried reverting to my backup of the previous version, and guess what, it now says that my phone was registered to someone else and I can't access my cloud library or Prime Music.So, I give up Amazon. I've bought a ton of crap from you, and I would probably buy a lot more music from you if I could buy it on my phone and be an even happier Prime customer if I could listen to Prime Music on my phone, but this app is a total disaster and the biggest black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shopping and Kindle apps work great, Music works great on my iPad (and Kindle Fire and Fire TV), so I don't know what your problem is."
Amazon,Great App and even better with Prime Music,Dawod Albattat,10-Sep-14,5,"It's a great app and with Prime Music it became even better.I really wish if I could get access to Prime Music even when I'm not in the US,that's definitely would make it the best music streaming app ever.I contacted Amazon Customers Service and asked them about playing music through Prime Music outside the US.They told me that I must have a credit card issued in the USA in my Amazon account to be able to listen to Prime Music even when not in the US.I have deleted the US credit card and that what caused the problem."
Amazon,I dislike the updated user interface,Steven Glasser,27-Nov-16,4,I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user.

Amazon,Too much like right,shanea' thomas,24-Aug-17,3,"It's an alright music streaming service. My only issue is that its crazy how for Amazon to have all these options such as kindle, echo, music, prime, etc. they can't seem to keep up with the updated payment information for one Amazon account. It makes no sense to me AT ALL."
Amazon,4/5 Has a lot of music you'd want,Bill,22-Jun-16,4,It's improved now that my phone can control all music and can manage the equalizer without an in app setting but there are still intermittent pauses or breaks in music every so often. But overall I like this app a lot.
Amazon,Fundamental Process Flaws,RealSmartFun,21-Jul-15,1,"1) When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 clicks.  Amazon forces you to load the app, wait for the library to update (which takes some time), find it in the library, then download it.  If the internet were ubiquitous, I would not need to download. But since it isn't I download first. Please don't make this so hard.2) Each time I buy something, I am prompted to download the app (with a pop us that really pushes you to download the app). I already have the app, so quit confusing me."

It also says you can ""download"" music if you are a Prime member but I haven't figured out how to do it without paying for the songs. If it is possible that is fine but it apparently isn't user friendly."

Amazon,Love this perk with prime!,SuperMOM,21-Aug-16,5,I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.I love all the chanel's offered.
Amazon,No artist data,WillPower,29-Jul-14,3,"When I use with Bluetooth in car  the displayed data is missing artist.  I can see track and album but artist data missing.  This only happens with Amazon music.  Google, songza, milk, Pandora, Spotify all display complete data"

Amazon,do not get  this app,Sandra Van,4-Jul-14,1,I am a prime member and  looking forward to listening to Prime music  in addition to the music I  bought. This app crashed and did some bad things to my Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet. This app does not work.i do not recommend this app.
Amazon,Nice perk for prime members,anix,6-Apr-16,4,"For prime members, this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices.  I was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime.  I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists.  Also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card."
Amazon,Animal need MORE MUUUUUSIC!,R.S.G.M.,17-Jan-16,5,"Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that songs I consider my favorites, that really shouldn't be rare or hard to find, are amiss from this app... oh well,  the pros must definitely outweigh the cons."
Amazon,is not that bad,AlexUnboxingChannel,8-Dec-14,4,"The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3."
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads,Greg,4-Oct-14,3,"Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads. The Lady Gaga Artpop album I bought was half the price of Google Play app. I also noticed that Google Play matched the price when I went back to compare their price. However, Amazon Prime gift cards in the stores start at $25. ""Whew"", "" Wow""! It's a high price to pay for one album if that's all you need. I don't have a credit card and am on a limited income. What happened to the days of the $10 iTunes card? Overall though it's quite good!"
Amazon,Best music app!,Stephanie A. Osburn,12-Jan-16,5,"This app gives you access to all of the music that Amazon has. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get accessed to free music that you can even download top you're devices. There are stations recommended for you & playlists you can create by adding music to your library. It's definitely my new go-to for music. It's like combining Pandora & an MP3 player. Best of birth worlds!"

That is one of the main reasons I got my membership.  I like being able to listen to the music I have picked on my phone via bluetooth in my car.  I can switch it to the Offline Library so it does not charge me data to listen to my music.  I would not be without it!

Amazon,Spotify is still a better deal.,Kevin,18-Aug-14,3,"I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce.  Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music.  If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead.  Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems.  Seriously, at  $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product."
Amazon,Five Stars,Kindle Customer,9-Nov-16,5,Love this app. It has so many features.
Amazon,Latest update sucks!,Mickey77cp,29-Dec-16,1,"It was nice having a large selection of free music with my Prime membership, but latest update seems to have taken a lot of that away. As if the Prime membership fee is not enough, you now want me to pay a subscription to listen to music that was once inluded with Prime! Guess you need to be more like the competitors and nickle and dime your customers at every turn!"
Amazon,"Another bad marketing choice by Amazon dumped over the head of its Prime members as a ""bonus""!?!",sPeeDeeBee,7-Sep-14,2,"I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime  Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."
Amazon,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works!",91FXSTS,12-Jul-14,4,"This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download.

Amazon,Amazon is Great!,J. Adams,9-Jul-15,5,"Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I don't have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of 250 songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
Amazon,"Very disappointed, considering looking elsewhere for a cloud service/music player",Mike Foley,10-Nov-14,2,"Regularly crashes and gives errors, I've talked to tech support numerous times, each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy.

Amazon,good quality. Desktop app is nice,A. Bozarth,30-Aug-17,4,"Lot of music,  good quality. Desktop app is nice. But can't cast to chrome cast, and not as user friendly when it comes to offline stuff like Spotify."
Amazon,My Music,Shirley,1-May-17,5,I love my music on my phone while work outside.
Amazon,Good music selection and easy download,Msplumuniq,14-Mar-16,5,Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes.
Amazon,Losses track of library,Amazon Customer,27-May-15,1,"I use this to run with. Only problem is everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out, sign back in, and redownload the songs in my playlist. Then as soon as I disconnect from WiFi it loses my songs again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very updating bug."
Amazon,Beware!!!,ScubaJim,1-Dec-15,1,"I bought 30 songs which can only be downloaded to cloud. Spent hours over many days on the phone with Amazon to try to get it into my library on my Galaxy S6. Told me theyou would call me back. Never did and won't answer my emails. The offered me $4 credit for my next song purchase.  Yes, $4 on $45 worth of songs that I canr hear in my library. No more buying songs from Amazon for me."
Amazon,Another stupid music app,Neil Ellenburg,25-Jun-16,1,Who needs another worthless waste of space & RAM app?
Amazon,"Clunky UI, buggy, and uninformative",JDK,5-Jun-15,3,"CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
Amazon,doesn't always work,P. de Greyt,25-Aug-14,3,"I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
Amazon,This app sucks,Linda Kapovich,12-Dec-16,1,This app sucks.  I read there is not a charge it's free.  Ya right until you try to download a song.  I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance.  It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!!  Gee wiz

Amazon,Super Job with Amazon Prime Music!,Amazon Customer,25-Jan-16,5,"I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music!  I have just started using this service,  but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch!  An endless selection of artists stations as well.  Great job Amazon!"
Amazon,I like it. Wish there were more choices,Douglas from Denver,2-Oct-16,4,I like it.  Wish there were more choices.  The selection is limited
Amazon,Completely Useless - Randomly stops stream.  Way better options to stream music.,Scott L.,2-Jan-15,1,"The absolute worst streaming music app I have ever used.  It constantly stops streaming regardless of the device I am using to listen to music.  This happens on any network when I attempt to use the device.  It even stops on my Kindle.  You would think it if was going to work, the best option would be on the Kindle but nope.  I have no problems with Spotify or Pandora ever stopping.  If I wasn't a Prime member, there is no way I would ever use this completely useless services."

Unfortunately, it can not be used safely while driving.On my Kia Optima it will not change songs by pushing the up or down on the steering wheel.A voice command/ Alexa style function would be nice for searching for songs while driving."
Amazon,Use It Everyday,Kam Domber,24-Jan-17,5,"I really enjoy the Amazon music app. With the auto-rip feature from Amazon, you get free digital copies of your music on Amazon Music.

Amazon,I LOVE BEING AN AMAZON PRIME MEMBER!,Gabriel Millayes,29-Jul-15,5,"When I first started this membership, I was skeptical with the service.  2 day delivery, free prime music, free prime movies.  But boy was I blown away!  My wife and I enjoy the Fast and Speedy delivery! When they say ""Guaranteed in 2 days"" THEY MEAN IT!  The free prime music and movies are better than what I bargained for and for what I paid with that 1 time payment, you will see you get Soo much more!  I'm just regular guy from NY that found this membership to be a great deal!"
Amazon,A nice bonus for Prime customers!,Amazon Customer,29-May-15,5,"A nice bonus to Prime.  Now I not only get priority shipping, I have my favorite music, for any occasion, with me on the go, at home or on the road."
Amazon,Thx for putting fu nction ality back in!,Grzegorz Tokarski,12-Dec-13,4,"I loved it, then there was an ""upgrade"" that broke everything... my main pain was losing lock screen controls, and shuffled lists... Well, finaly in update #3 or #4, the stuff is back! Amazon MP3 on my Android is usable again! I know if I had blue tooth radio, I could do without it, but as I do not - I depend on an easy way to skip a track - without unlocking the phone. I almost wish there were ""hot zones"" active if the phone is dark.. but whayt is there, is better than nothing, as was the case till few weeks ago!Not 5 stars, as the app could be better, and changes break it from time to time.. but certainly back to 4 stars!"
Amazon,"Music buffers, and stalls",Annie48,8-Jan-16,3,"For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it doesn't transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I'm not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
Amazon,And I enjoy working with it thank you,Vincent M. Deluccia,2-Nov-17,5,User-friendly and has all the songs that I and picked out including my oldies my golden oldies! And I enjoy working with it thank you.

Amazon,Needs easier connection to Samsung Multiroom.,GC-ELP,13-Mar-17,3,"Nice to have on the phone, but it doesn't work with the Samsung Multiroom app unless you buy songs for your library - at least so far I didn't find a way to use it with my bluetooth speaker at home."
Amazon,"good, but could be better.",M.P.,9-Jan-16,3,"The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you  ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it."

Amazon,A Grandmother with an MP3 App?,Nannie,12-Apr-13,4,"I listen to music, as I take my daily walk.  I chose this product, because the FM radio app was non-functional, and at times Pandora is unreliable.  The Amazon MP3 app is amazing.  It's always there!  I like that I can create customized playlists--never had one before.  The fact that music I buy from Amazon is downloadable to my electronic devices is truly slick.  I purchasedd an MP3 player for one of my grandchildren, but the whole thing seemed too mysterious and complicated to me.  I'm not too savvy with apps anyway, but I am regularly discovering some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon, for making this free app available to your customers."
Amazon,2 stars,Fred  Wilson,31-Jul-17,2,I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad.
Amazon,great selction,squrrielley,8-Jun-16,5,really great selection & gteat to have all in 1 place.
Amazon,Would be great if it worked...,Andrew Vaillencourt,16-Jun-14,1,"On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play songs from Prime Music. Before the upgrade, I used this app extensively, and liked it. It now either freezes, crashes, or freezes and crashes every time I try to play any of the Prime Music songs. The songs in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially, Prime music has added zero songs for my enjoyment, and the app upgrade has broken the app. Well played!"
Amazon,What a waste of a great idea,Amazon Customer,4-Feb-16,1,"Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non-user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back (again). They need to consolidate some things quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organizations. When you fix it, please call me. Signed: wish I could have spent my $105.00 dollars."
Amazon,never did figure out how to get any of the ...,Christinexoxodillon,4-Nov-15,1,never did figure out how to get any of the benefits of prime to work before my free trial ended. no clue how to play music or watch anything
Amazon,Huge battery suck makes great app suck,Kindle Customer,29-Dec-16,2,"I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25% of the battery drain.  Samsung S7 edge up to date stock.  Fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non-use is collecting data."
Amazon,Another reason to get Amazon Prime!,Seth S.,26-Dec-15,5,Love it. What a wonderful app to have with prime membership. Definitely worth it and makes listening to music and skipping as easy as a button click. Would recommend over other music apps due to music selection and simplicity of usage.
Amazon,Wwaaaayyyyyyyy better than Pandora',Reviewing Queen B #10558#,11-Mar-16,5,"I love this! I listened to Pandora for a long long time. Then I found out that this was a benefit of having an Amazon Prime account. So I went through and added a whole bunch of songs. I found it easiest to look up a song, then go to a playlist it was in, and then add songs like a crazy person from there LOL I now have a very large library and often open up Amazon music and hit Shuffle and go about doing my chores, or cleaning up around the house. Certainly makes it more enjoyable! And it's nice to have ALL songs that I like. And with most of them, I've been able to add to my playlist for free. You can even download for offline play. Not every song is on here but I have only found one that I really wanted that wasn't. And I purchased it for 99 cents. I love this app/ bonus feature of Amazon Prime"

Amazon,Love love love Amazon!,C C,4-Dec-15,5,I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!
Amazon,Great service,Paul Lewis,2-Dec-15,4,A great service and well worth it. You can find most any kind of music with the exception of some older songs. Some great movies to watch though I haven't gotten a chance to watch a lot of them. Orders placed with prime arrived on time and no problems. I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch movies or listen to music and wants to get your orders in a couple of days.
Amazon,Update sucks,Amazon Customer,29-Jun-14,1,"This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card  continue listening to music.Not happy!"
Amazon,Would NOT Work!,Obe,11-Aug-16,2,Would NOT play audio on android. Show that it's playing but NO! audio. Tried everything to no avail. Even reformatted device and still no audio!  DISSAPOINTED!
Amazon,Love my Amazon Music!,Amazon Customer,8-May-17,5,Amazon music is easy to use and I can find anything I want to listen to on it. I'm so much happier since I started my service. Since starting it I've dropped my Sirius account and Pandora. Strictly Amazon music for this girl from now on!
Amazon,I love the idea of one place like prime to do ...,David,15-Aug-15,3,"I have Rhapsody now, so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is, rhapsody is easier and I don't have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/food(way to expensive!)/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
Amazon,Don't Wait - Get This App Today!,Holley Jacobs,13-Aug-15,5,"Amazon Music with Prime MusicåÊAll kinds of music are passions of mine. I am a Prime Amazon member but have to say; next to the two-day shipping that Prime members receive, this is the second best feature offered. I have the app on my phone, my Kindle, and my computers. They ALL work great and I have not had any problems at all with them. The app has ""stations"" that I absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together. I can make my own playlists with east on all devices. You can separate each song by album, singer, or genre. The platform is the same on each device which is great - no further learning on each device. I have over 6,000 songs on my app and have used MANY other similar apps from other companies. They do not come close to this easy to use great app."
Amazon,Lots of new music,kyle wiles,23-Jul-16,4,"The app itself could be easier to navigate, but I'm still going to give it a high rating because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not had a problem also getting to listen to that song on this app for free. Anyway, it's not a perfect interface but they make up for by giving a great selection of music."
Amazon,Can't make it work,Ismore,10-Feb-13,2,"I've used this app in the past without any trouble on my current phone (Motorola Atrix 2) and on a PC and Samsung tablet, but now I cannot get the app to work properly on my Atrix 2.  Logging in just wouldn't happen until I restarted the phone, and after finally logging in, now it won't load my cloud music.  It just cycles with the message ""Loading your cloud music..."".  My connection via wifi is good and everything else works just fine.  I'm assuming this is caused by a recent update."
Amazon,Wide variety of music. Its just ridiculous they want ...,Robert,5-Jul-15,2,Wide variety of music. Its just ridiculous they want $99 up front just to tie you to a contract on something you probably won't use daily.

So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents. I looked through everything with music and it never downloaded and I have no way of getting the songs unless I bought them again. What a rip off !

Amazon,Gotta Love It!,Miketheelder,17-May-16,5,"As an Amazon Prime user I have been able to build a sizable library of music using Amazon Prime songs and albums. This app has allowed me to go back 5,10,20years or more and cherry pick many of my favorite songs from the past, along near current sounds. It is not why I am a member of Prime but it is icing on top of the cake."
Amazon,Crash ONCE and get out of the way...don't make my tablet unusable!,Amazon Customer,20-Nov-14,1,"If an app MUST crash, it should do it once and get it over with. NOT keep bringing up the ""Unfortunately, Amazon Music has stopped"" box over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I couldn't report the crash to Google because the crash box wouldn't stay out of the way long enough to file the report. Couldn't get to the Application Manager to force stop the program because the crash box kept coming up. Deleting this piece of malware NOW."
Amazon,LOVE this app,Foxxen,18-May-15,4,"As a Prime member, this app is pretty much an essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love creating playlists and have found a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora (my previous favorite) any day! I wish that it would recommend music as I love to discover new artists but so far I've made it work by cross referencing a certain song with what others have added in playlists containing it."

Amazon,I like to listen offline,dragon658,31-Jul-15,2,"I like to listen offline. Your service requires me to be online to use it while driving, therefore wasting my valuable data. Music downloaded to my library should be available when and where I want it without having to stream it every time. You can do this by requiring the user to update every week or month like other services do. If they don't update frequently the music deletes or locks until they do."
Amazon,I love having this ap to listen to full albums,AmazonMom,29-Sep-16,4,"I love having this ap to listen to full albums!It's a pain if it won't load sometimes,  but a lot of that is just Internet connection."
Amazon,Got to have Amazon Music,Amazon Customer,5-Jan-15,5,OMG!!!  The BEST thing I ever got! I LOVE being able to get the old music I grew up on and the new artists I discover. I have recommended this to everyone I know. The cost of Amazon Prime with all that I get for the dollars is the best money I spend every year. This music just makes it better. I NEVER have trouble playing the music and being able to download music and have it in the cloud so I can hear it anywhere makes this the best music source I have used.
Amazon,USA issued Credit Card.... seriously?,JosÌ© GarcÌ_a,7-Oct-15,1,"Music Collection under prime could be better, nevertheless i am happy with it because i don't need my spotify subscription--edit--After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i don't have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."

Amazon,I have yet to figure out what is free and ...,Jo M - Tulsa,26-Jan-16,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
Amazon,Love,EmJay,18-Dec-16,5,"Great app! I cannot live without my amazon music. You can shop, create play lists and will show up as apart of your regular music app that's on your phone. Keep in mind you can do most of this but I do have prime which may be allowing me to do all of these things."
Amazon,amazon sucks,Amazon Customer,28-Jan-16,1,Terrible interface. Horrible when driving. Terrible blue tooth compatibility.  Playlists dont always transfer.  Terrible ability to scan for new music. Synching sucks. Slow as hell. A failure and disgrace for amazon.

Amazon,why I need to change phone's language to use this app?,Galina Strizheva,29-Jan-15,1,"Dear Amazon,USA is an international country with people speaking on more than 6 most common languages. Android (thanks to Google folks) kind of thought of this, so Android system is adjustable for any of more than 50 languages. I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems.  Until this will be fixed, I would stay with Google."
Amazon,Disappointed,Amazon Customer,31-Aug-15,1,"I am unable to download purchased music to my phone/tablet.  The only way to access is through the internet. I like to use my purchase music as ringtones and things. However, one can listen to the playlist from one's phone/tablet but not the other way.  They call it offline music. Tried to return for a refund but could not find the option.  I can purchase the album and download it that way."

Amazon,One Star,Monty Miller,2-Nov-17,1,I did not think I would have to give more money to hear the music when I want to.
Amazon,Works good.,K.W.,5-Jul-16,3,Not overly user friendly.  Lacks any serious interactive functions. Your downloaded music for offline listening has to be individually added to Playlist.  There seems to be no way to modify the properties of the individual audio files to identify a song as a genre that you think it more closely resembles.
Amazon,"Music,music,music!!!!!",james mercurio,26-Mar-16,5,"I love music and this is the best I have found. I can't think of any song or artist that I haven't been able to find.

Give them a try, especially the ones with free trials. Simply pick the one that works best for you."

Amazon has a lot.I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free.I am overall happy with it.Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear.
Amazon,mediocre music service,D. J. Nunez,6-Feb-15,3,"I'll vote in the mediocre as ""ok"" because that's all it deserves.  The main drive for purchasing an Amazon Prime account was for the vast variety of books I can purchase and borrow for my Kindle.  Otherwise, the Music app is below par.  Clunky download/upload application and the service doesn't have access to thousands of old songs from certain labels.  It's good for when playing/streaming music from my PC at home and that's about it."
Amazon,Amazing app!,Bruce,30-May-16,5,Love Amazon music. If you have prime there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have this app and shouldn't be using. This works fantastic with Alexa and has a great selection of music.

Amazon,Not user friendly....,Lavivian J. Wicks,25-Oct-16,3,"While this new version of Amazon Music holds mostly all of my music, it's not nearly as user friendly as the previous version."
Amazon,Only use it if you already have prime.,Nick,24-Aug-16,3,"Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this."
Amazon,Music Galore,Jeanne,8-Mar-16,5,I love this addition and listen almost daily.  Variety is marvelous!
Amazon,"Best Music App Available Better Than Pandora, Google Music, iTunes","Your pal, Hal",30-Mar-16,5,The selection is incredible. The quality is top notch. Classical bundle varieties very educational.
Amazon,good- but annowing Prime option screen,C. Ricketts,31-Dec-14,4,my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I don't have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us don't live in a city where it's everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. That's it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen.
Amazon,This app is so bad that I might not renew my Amazon Prime!,OnlyWishie,16-Dec-16,2,"This used to be a great app. Now it sucks to use on a computer. It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
Amazon,I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics,Leti Guerra,3-Nov-16,4,"I'm so glad they brought back the lyrics. I thought they were gone after the most recent update but then there they were.  Although I wish like with Google music, when listening to a station, you could see the list of song as they are about to play to customize better."

Amazon,Good but just top pop,Amazon Customer,29-Sep-16,3,It is a good addition to prime but the music is still just top pop of what they want you to hear. I would like more off beat choices
Amazon,Only USA,Betoma,5-Apr-17,4,Huge number of songs and type of music
Amazon,The best music app I've ever had,Yasmine,14-Nov-17,5,The best music app I've ever had! I have access to everything except for new dropped albulms which is fine because I can either wait or upgrade my subscription. Plus no ads it's straight to the next song and skip as much as you would like !
Amazon,Angry In Idaho,Nick,23-Aug-14,1,"As a long time Amazon Prime customer I cannot think of a time I have been more upset and hindered by a product in my life.  I woke up today to find my cell phone off, once I powered it up I was greeted by rapid fire crash reports showing that prime music had crashed.  My phone had to be put into recovery mode twice before the app could be removed.  I was able to sent the crash reports to Amazon.  I am incredibly upset as I missed several service calls and am setback at least two hours."
Amazon,Love it!,Wild Bill,27-Apr-16,5,"Who can't love this app? I use it more than any other streaming apps. Skip songs as many times as you like with no restrictions. Download songs to device, save it to the cloud or just play from Amazon to see if you like it. I can't say enough about this app. It's great!! Sign up for prime and you'll be loving it too!!"

My only minor issue is that two family members cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However, you can still listen to downloaded music/playlists while another streams from the cloud. Amazing benefit of the Prime Membership."
Amazon,Very impressive,Amanda,24-Mar-16,5,"I have tried many music players like this in the past, and this is by far one of the most impressive ones. It has an easy search function, and is smooth with no ads (if you are prime user I'm assuming). And it saves your recently listened to stations in one easy to find list. All in all I am quite impressed with this product."
Amazon,Five Stars,Jaematt,8-Mar-16,5,Great music. Love listening to it while at work and driving.  love this app.
Amazon,if u want to find music u love and play it on your laptop,fbg,31-Mar-16,3,"i use Roku, and the playlists are hard to sync. if u want to find music u love and play it on your laptop, or phone, its great. if u want to listen to pre made playlists, its not great. if u want to sync to your roku. not so good. and you really cant listen to music downloaded from other sources like u can with google play."
Amazon,Pros & Cons,goodnitesaigon,17-Apr-15,3,"I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it's not unlimited. For the annual fee, I expected to be able to stream any music I wanted. There are limits to the free music. Even older genres must be purchased. The ability to rewind and replay songs is excellent and a definite plus over regular streaming apps like Pandora, Milk, etc., but the complete freedom of free streaming apps is a plus over Amazon music."
Amazon,Thank you Amazon !!!  I received a great gift from you,Amazon Customer,8-Oct-13,5,"I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs.  It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs.  At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!!  I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Thank you Amazon !!"

Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get ""Exception #151"" and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"

Amazon,"This app is great, easy to use",Dr SpaceMan,23-Jun-16,5,"This app is great, easy to use, and does everything I need it to. I just wish I could search through the music store and buy music without having to change apps."
Amazon,"useless, app keep saying i have an issue in my prime account while prime management Web page States there is no issue at all",Amazon Customer,24-Jun-14,2,"Really was excited about this addition but the app keeps asking me to renew my prime subscription and to go to the main prime Webpage to see the problem,  when entering the Webpage there is no problem.  In conclusion I cannot listen to my added music by using the app"
Amazon,"Amazon is the best way to buy music, period.",hruss63,27-Feb-16,5,"I think it's the best way to buy music these days.  You have a selection of what you're looking for,  then you get immediate delivery via download,  house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened,  if you want. Plus no driving,  store lines or tax, if you're lucky enough to live someplace that doesn't make you pay it."

Amazon,OFTEN HAS ERRORS LOADING STORE,Allie Smith,9-Sep-15,2,"It's a bit of a crapshoot whether or not the Amazon Music Store loads. It isn't an internet issue, or a maximum data usage issue. My phone (which is new and has no problems with other apps) sometimes sits trying to load it for 20 mins after which I cancel for data usage issues. It has a wide selection but if I can't load the store half the time, how can I access the selection???"
Amazon,super super happy with Amazon Music.,Chris (New York),26-Apr-17,5,super super happy with Amazon Music.
Amazon,Limited Listening Options,Amazon Customer,9-Jul-14,2,"I'm very unhappy with the shift from Cloud Player t Amazon Music. In most corporate setting employees are not given the choice of browsers they use or what programs they may install, which in this case means I can no longer listen to my purchased music at work. The compatibility with only the latest IE browsers or installing non-IE browsers in an imposibility. I understand Amazon is in the money-making business but some of the recent changes make me think customer service is no longera priority."
Amazon,The best music app out there!,Gallia,26-Jun-17,5,"Greatest app! All your favorite songs, no adds, unlimited skips and replays. Doesn't ask you if you're still listening. Just another awesome addition to your Amazon Prime account"

Amazon,A nice addition to my Prime membership,Thomas Bell,22-Apr-16,4,"A nice addition to my Prime membership. I think overall it is a nice music service but the lack of tracks available has me still using Spotify for most of my music streaming.

Amazon,Music galore.Get rocking.,Amazon Customer,8-Dec-16,5,Excellent choice of music New and old. Definitely recommend it to people of all ages and all types of music.Only recently acquired Amazzon Prime but wish I had got it a long time ago. Can also download music on my phone or tablet to listen offline.
Amazon,The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate,Adar ICT,1-Jun-15,3,"The app itself is pretty good. Easy to navigate, and it does what it should. Performance though is a problem. I've used this on my HTC One M7, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, and a Samsung Galaxy S5.all of them have terrible performance. On wifi, it is just barely acceptable. Over 3g or even 4g, it takes an almost obscene amount of time to start streaming. This may be expected when on lower bandwidth connections, but it isn't just that it is buffering. It takes up 90 percent cpu time, impacting anything else I am doing. Seeing the same behavior on 2 M7s, plus the tablet and the S5,indicates it is an app problem. Initially I thought it was a side effect of the initial synching, but the problem continues days later.On the positive side, being able to download so you can listen offline is great. As I said, the app itself is easy and intuitive for the most part. If the performance can be addressed it will be a great app. As it is, it is relegated to occasional use."
Amazon,Disappointed. Doesn't work on my HTC Rezound. Can't say for other phones.,W. L.,6-Nov-13,1,"I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I."
Amazon,Couldn't get Amazon Prime Music to quickly and conveniently download music to my phone,mboosh,27-Jun-14,1,"After downloading the mobile app, and signing in to my Prime account, I attempted to stream music to my phone (Android).  I was disappointed.  It allowed me to download and play one album for free.  However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time.  So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly.  I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."
Amazon,Love it!,Robert Moore,1-Aug-15,5,Love the service. Had many up to date music and a lot of classics.

Stjames,11-Jan-17,4,"I would have given it 5 stars, however, when my Windows 8 computer crashed, during the transfer to the dreaded and despised Windows 10, I lost the ability to play or rip from Amazon Music.

Amazon,"Great app, but it's got some bugs",Jesus Policarpo,14-Nov-16,3,"Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes doesn't actually ""download"". Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly"
Amazon,"Amazon , release an instant video app for Android",PT Richards,5-Jun-14,1,"I'm ticked.  Amazon refuses to release an Amazon instant video app for other Android devices.  Amazon is more than happy to take and use Android source, but refuses to support those of us that want to use a device that does more than just consume Amazon content.  There are very few choices when it comes to video streaming sites and Amazon needs to get its head straight and start listening."
Amazon,My Favorite Music App,F. Fazio,21-Dec-16,5,I use Amazon Music with my Prime membership.  I'm very happy with all of the ad free music available.  One of the best features is the ability to download music to your device for offline playing.  Amazon Music has a good variety of music available.

Amazon,Glitchy and will not close (Galaxy S5),C. Edwards,22-Dec-14,1,"I have had this app for about 3 weeks and it continues to disappoint. Below are my major complaints.Won't shut off - if I pause the music, ope  my recent apps and click the &#34;x&#34; button to close the app 9/10 times the music player opens itself back up, i have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it to close.Downloading music - it is great that you can download the Prime music, that is an awesome feature, however, if you only want certain songs from an album and you stop the other songs from downloading, the downloadet pops up everytime you use the app. It says the downloads are paused even though i have canceled the dow loads 12 times.  I do not have unlimited data and do not want every song from the albums in question. On the topic of downloading songs, if you search for albums or songs and download them to your phone, often times it will not show them as in your library when you search again, so you can end up downloading several copies of the same song/album. There is not consistency between the music store and your local library.Glitchy - the app will often glitch when opening or closing and will not respond to commands. I have attempted two reinstalls and still no luck.Amazon really needs to get their heads together and fix this app, it has a lot of potential, but sucks the big one right now."
Amazon,Thanks for the memories and the future to come!,MaMaaz,23-Oct-16,5,"I'm listening to ""Hamilton"" the Broadway musical now. What more could I want? My daughters are grown and gone.

Yes, I understand, wholeheartedly, that we are in a new tech era where NO ONE would be caught dead burning, little on, listening to a cd, but Im not one of those sheepish lame ""gotta keep up with everyone"" douche bags... I bought my music. Therefore, I should be able to stream it, burn it, copy it (as long as I don't claim it as my own; youtube). Not all cars are equipped with ipod docking devices. Mine has a good ol fashioned cd player, Thank God, oops, I didnt offend anyone by Thanking my Lord did I? I wouldn't be apologetic anyway. I'm not forcing religion on you.

Amazon,Great music app,ImJoeMan,12-Feb-16,4,I really love this music app. I like that I can search and find almost any song. I hate using the Pandora and other apps because you have to wait forever to hear the song you really want to hear.The app does seem to force close every couple of days. Most of the time it works flawlessly. Another benefit of using prime.

They already know what albums I'm going to like and suggest them so that I can add them to my play list. Best of all I don't have to pay any extra money it's already included with my Prime Membership. I don't even use iTunes or beats what ever they are calling themselves these days
Amazon,Gotta do some searching to get it for BB.,Michael Burgess,3-May-15,4,"I tried to download to my BB via amazon apps and amazon mobile. No luck so, had to use a mirror to download.The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash. Otherwise, the sound quality at the highest level (in a compatible wi-fi environment) is fantastic, and it's better than having to listen to pandora or spotify with their commercials."

Amazon,Prime Music Service Review,Amazon Prime Android User,29-Aug-14,2,"Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for ""offline"" listening.  It seems to me that having more songs streamed to Prime Members wouldn't cost Amazon all that much more money, especially since most of them are VERY old songs!!!  Also, a few more of the newer recordings, or, compilation albums would be nice."
Amazon,A must have,Lori Peterson,22-Jan-16,5,"Great app! I can just listen to music on the run, or I can make playlists and mark favorites as I hear them. My favorite thing is being able to download songs for offline listening. That has to be the best feature."
Amazon,Junk,Q. Public,28-Feb-17,1,"As few features they have for yhis app you might think they would work, unfortunately often they don't. Feels like this app is just a marketing ploy to make people think they are getting more from Amazon prime then they will."

Amazon,Love the music,D. Robinson,29-Mar-16,5,I've been using the Amazon music app for my Samsung Note 4 for about a year now.  I love that there are no commercials.  Choosing the prime music to listen to its easy and there are so many choices!  The prime stations have a good variety of music that the station selects for me to listen. I use it almost every day!
Amazon,"I *LOVE*Amazon Prime Music, BUT...",Father O'Four,14-Aug-15,2,"I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it.  It is a HUGE, space-consuming app!  Let me elaborate:  I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year.  I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l.  APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc.  Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon)  Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data!  Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!!  WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!?  This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed, I was constantly  receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work.  That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed.  This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!!  Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled.  When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"

Amazon,Won't work,Sandra R. Babcock,9-Dec-16,1,Won't work on my phone unless I have internet service and won't play music that is stored on my phone
Amazon,good music!,Amazon Customer,13-Oct-17,5,"I signed up on Prime day for the 4 month 0.99 deal and can access songs that are hard to find on Pandora, etc."
Amazon,Small music selection. Confusing,Steven Blanchard,6-Feb-17,2,"Doesn't seem to be much to offer here that has music in which I am interested. I thought this was free, but then it keeps wanting me to upgrade to another level. Not much value from what I understand, especially compared to what I get on Pandora."
Amazon,Could be slightly improved.,Florence's,7-Jan-17,3,"Only just started to use Music unlimited ( Also have Echo and Dot) by the way is Brill.Previously used Deezer which was Fab, so far Amazon music is fine my kids on the other hand, not so keen, no Now that's  what I call  compilations available ."
Amazon,"best mp3 player, and if it could play drm files it would be perfect",Elizabeth A. Schauble,27-Aug-11,5,"Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."
Amazon,now everybody's happy!,cafeconleche1,7-Aug-17,5,"Downloaded quickly...wide variety of music available. Picked up PRIME Family.package, now everybody's happy!"
Amazon,Good Value,PanFish,28-Dec-14,4,Woeks a little quirky when selecting another album to play but it may just me me learning to use it. Good value with the Prime membership.
Amazon,Hung on install pending,quiet_fan,4-Jun-16,1,"Pops up every day saying it's ready for installation but just hangs with ""install pending"". Can't get it to uninstall to start over. This on top of it being a huge resource hog with no way to adjust. Total disappointment.  Can't wait to get rid of it, even though I pay for Prime."
Amazon,Five Stars,Zo3boyHT,28-Aug-17,5,It's pretty good!
Amazon,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,2-Jun-17,3,"I need a ""how to"" manual.  There is no instruction"
Amazon,But I guess that is also nice to have as a backup,BTj,31-Aug-14,2,My first download was the Beatles - which turned out to be a front band.The music choices are limited - and the phone app is kind of hard to use on android.But since it comes with free with prime - maybe I'll keep prime as long as you don't keep upping the price.I don't really use the video stream as I have Netflix - which the same thing - the netflix app is easier to use and more recent choices.But I guess that is also nice to have as a backup.
Amazon,Terrible customer service!!!!!,zach terzano,6-Jun-16,1,Terrible customer service!!!!!

Amazon,Great way to listen to a wide variety of music,Lee Kraftchick,5-Sep-15,5,"A great service.  Prime Music provides easy and ecomical access to a wide variety of music without commercial interruption. Subscribers are able to choose between listening to individual songs, albums, playlists or stations.  A great deal of the music, including the playlists, stations and vintage albums, are available free to Prime Members.  More recent recordings can be sampled and purchased for immediate download."
Amazon,Create your own playlists,Mrs C.,3-Jan-17,5,I love how easy it is to create your own playlists and then have them played back on the echo dot!
Amazon,Needs Work,Lady in Georgia,17-May-15,2,"I would like to give more stars, but you can't depend on the stream. Tired of having to constantly fix the playback. There are certain playlists that won't play at all. Sure hope Amazon fixes this poor streaming. Plenty other streaming companies to go with that won't disappoint."
Amazon,Five Stars,Hi you,16-Nov-16,5,good
Amazon,Great Service,Annette,4-Dec-16,5,"I enjoy this service- included in Prime membership, great music selection and I can find basically anything. I don't see the need to use any other music service. Plus unlimited skips and I haven't found a song yet that I couldn't download for free."

Amazon,WTF!!,Lauri Robinson,23-May-14,1,"Amazon sent me an offer for $3.00 in free music so I went to the MP3 store and accidently hit the ""buy"" button rather whatever button I was supposed to hit to get the free offer.  Okay, fine, it's only $3.00 but then I couldn't even get the MP3 app to work on my Galaxy 3 Android.  I get error #45, which I tried Googling but got no resolve.  I'll stick with the I Heart Radio app."
Amazon,Greed has cost you a customer.  I will be cancelling all subscriptions.,Dr. Katherine Arenz,24-Apr-17,1,"This has been the worst business decision Amazon.  I used to love the app and buying music through you. Now you have gotten greedy.  I no longer can get any music i download via the mobile app to play on any player but yours.  YOur app is ridiculously inferior to other apps.  It is slow no matter if streaming or not...In fact, usually all i see is the gray circle of death rather than get to listen to music I OWN. i do NOT stream music. I am cancelling my subscription.  IN addition, now when trying to download to my pc...there is NO option to download all.  Instead, i have to click EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY ALMOST 5000 SONGS.  SO DONE."
Amazon,One Star,Ken W.,17-Jun-17,1,Fix this!

Amazon,Perhaps the best,Scott H.,6-Aug-15,5,The music selection is outstanding and the access could not be any easier. Th esuggestions are almost always spot on or very close to what I enjoy and prefer. One more reason that I really enjoy my Prime Membership and plan on being a life long member.
Amazon,One Star,Yellosuit,10-Jun-16,1,Just Nope...... Nuff said.
Amazon,Problems Combining!,Dusty,22-Jan-17,3,I have an audible account in my name and my wife has Amazon Prime in hers. I really wish there was a way to consolidate both accounts. and why the heck cant I listen to music on me echo and my wife is listening in her car? that's just stupid.
Amazon,Good Not Perfect,Karl W.,3-Mar-13,4,"I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet.  Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing.  It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with.  While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices.  An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it.  So far it is working well without too much difficulity."

Amazon,I like it but not as flexible as other music services ...,Orman Beckles,7-Jun-16,3,I like it but not as flexible as other music services in terms of being able to cast to devices...also the amount of my own music I can upload is limited.
Amazon,The other reviews scared me!!,Sherryl,31-May-17,4,"I downloaded one song after downloading Amazon for Kindle Fire (Android). Then, started reading reviews. Should've done it the other way around! Now, I'm worried about getting  screwed over!!!! I sure hope not!"
Amazon,Fantastic. All the music I could ever want,Jacob C. Wiggins,6-Apr-15,4,Fantastic. All the music I could ever want. It crashes a lot though and takes a while to upload from e cloud.
Amazon,"I rarely use Prime Video, but Prime Music was an unexpected surprise!",Hyytekk,25-Apr-16,5,"I've had Prime since it was first offered years ago, simply because it seems I order everything from Amazon and, well, like to receive things as quickly as possible. I appreciated the Video's that came later included for members, but to be perfectly honest, the selection seemed limited and unexciting so I rarely use it. I noticed in passing, this new Prime Music and imagined it would also be woefully deficient so never bothered to try it. Until a friend mentioned it enthusiastically to me, so I just this week put the app on my Android. Who knew! I still haven't done a thorough testing after just a few days, but have been extremely impressed by the artists represented. Considering the price of pay music services, this alone covers the cost of Prime. Now, I would keep Prime and did have it long before any of the added offerings were tacked on due to the volume of things I order every year. But if your hesitating, or think this Music service might be a bare bones lame offering, do not hesitate. Loving it! What a nice added bonus to a service I already loved! (No, I don't work for Amazon! Just an honest and frankly unexpected appraisal.)"
Amazon,Doesn't import everything over very accurately,Adrian Faulkner,7-Apr-14,1,"Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and doesn't import all types of audio files.Also find it a little frustrating to navigate through.The idea is great, but I feel I have wasted my å£21.00 yearly subscription and could have spent it better on another product."

Amazon,Can't Load on LG G3,Adam J Ritchie,10-Aug-16,1,I had it originally on my LG G3 phone. One day I went to use it and it wasn't there. I went to reinstall it and it failwd repeatedly.
Amazon,Needs some kinks worked out,akbopper,21-Jun-15,3,"I'm a loyal Amazon customer, and have been for years. I was really excited when I learned that my Prime subscription included the music service. I was even more excited to use the new Amazon Prime Stations feature. I thought it would be great to no longer use Pandora's ad-laden app. Well, beyond the intrusive nature that Amazon apps have evolved into (seriously, Bezos, what's up with the lack of privacy?) that some others have commented on, the music app needs some help in its basic functionality. It's cumbersome to navigate the search feature (you have to be in just the right sub-area of the app to find what you're looking for). The stations would be great if there were a way at all to search or organize them. As it is now, there are so many stations (100's) and as far as I'm able to tell, they are not really organized in any way, rendering them much less useful. I'm not sure why there isn't a way to search the stations or at least save your favorite ones.Come on, Amazon! Step up your game with your app design!"
Amazon,Yes on Prime Music,Janet Ann Jenson,9-Aug-14,4,"I think adding the free streaming music to the Prime membership is great.  It is not as easy to use for me as the old Napster was, but I like it as a substitute for Rhapsody."
Amazon,Absolutely awesome!!! And free!!,kyle c.,6-Oct-16,5,Absolutely awesome and free! You can listen to all the physical cds that u have purchased on amazons cloud the albums are automatically saved in the cloud after they are purchased and available to stream or download with this free app!!!

Amazon,It chews up your 4G data plan because of their BAD default update settings choice,Thomas Tinney,25-Sep-15,1,"The app is preset to download updates even if you are on your 4G and ignores the regular android settings of no large downloads except over 801 wireless. Chewed up MULTI-MEGABYTES over 4G before I realized what it, and it's companion apps, had done and how to turn it off. Total BS that they don't set the default update setting to ""Only over wireless"""

Amazon,LOVE IT !!!!!,NRA Guy,10-Feb-16,5,"No longer do I have to carry around CD's anymore & haven't done so in years.  Recently, I my music library was just not organized like I wanted it to be.  I have several different categories (rock, classical, country, alternative, comedy, Halloween sounds for trick or treaters, Christmas music for sitting around the house, etc.) and have all of it totally organized in its own category.  If I'm in the mood for country, I'll just scroll to country, hit ""shuffle all"" & hit play & all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order.  Whether it's on my smartphone or on my tablet, it's well worth it !!!"

Amazon,Love It,L Bennett,6-Jul-14,5,"I was seriously impressed with the range and variety of music available. When I read amazon was going to raise the prime cost I thought about dropping the service, the addition of the music has made me reconsider. There are so many benefits to prime now I will probably renew in October.  Did you know prime delivered, for free, a college textbook on Sunday via overnight service,  that my daughter needed on Monday. I liked prime for the price. Now I love it thanks to the music."
Amazon,Four Stars,Mark Fonte,12-Jul-17,4,Good but not competitive with Spotify or Apple Music
Amazon,Needs desktop app,Brian J. Tobias,2-May-17,4,"The only thing that this really needs is just a stand alone desktop app (like Spotify), would rather not fire up a web browser each and every time I want to use it."
Amazon,Careful but good,I Wonder 3902,22-Dec-16,4,Is a well organized app. I would like to give it a 5 star but I just noticed that I bought a song by accident. Makes me paranoid to listen to songs That have the same name by different artists. I will be more careful in the future. Still is a great app.
Amazon,Best Music Selection Anywhere,Victoria Sinclaire,2-Feb-17,5,"Love, love, love my Amazon music.  I listen to it at work, at the gym or at home while working around the house.

Amazon,... my music benefits if I pay as Prime user like everyone else,Amazon Customer,5-Dec-16,1,Amazon is an App used worldwide so why if I have to be in Panama o another country out of USA or Spain etc I can't use my music benefits if I pay as Prime user like everyone else??? Very disappointed with this app cause I'm unable to use it.
Amazon,"Amazon, take a cue from Pandora.",Ben,3-Apr-17,3,"A CLASSIC ROCK station with not ONE song by Led Zeppelin?? A JUAN GABRIEL station with ONE album from the singer and mixed with other genres having NOTHING to do with it. Additionally, songs such as ""Amor Eterno"" listing Juan Gabriel as the singer yet when I play it, it is not Juan Gabriel singing, and there are numerous amounts of songs like that. .An OLDIES station that plays a bunch of basically UNKNOWN songs. When building a play list, we are allowed to add duplicate songs without a warning. Same applies when suggested songs are listed with an option to ""ADD"" to my music when in fact the song is already in my music. I thought Prime Music would be replacing my Pandora, not any time soon. There is not enough room here to list all the issues and suggestions for improvement..."
Amazon,To hard to use.,NEDan,1-Jun-15,1,Too hard to navigate. Unable to figure out how to download as promised. Memory hog remember to shut it down.
Amazon,Love it!,Lia Burres,23-Jul-14,5,This loads perfectly on my phone and I can listen to the music even when I'm not at my desk or at home.  I enjoy being able to keep up with my music that I listen to in one place.
Amazon,I love my Prime Music,Hannah Marie,31-Dec-15,5,I love my Prime Music. The song choices are all that and more. The stations work much like iHeart with the bonus that you can go back to songs already played.  There are so many prime free albums you can download to your offline library and sharing between devices is really easy. I use my app several times a week with no issues.
Amazon,Its ok,Don,15-Jun-16,3,"It's ok. Doesn't have all the songs I like, like Spotify does but it's free with prime so I like it. I cancelled Spotify sometimes I wish I didn't."
Amazon,Good app - as long as you are in a strong wifi zone!,dwm,29-Jun-17,5,"The only real problem I have with this app is more the fault of my smartphone not having adequate wifi coverage where I work, so anything I want to listen to that's in the ""cloud"" is a problem.  Not the apps fault!  Stuff I have saved offline in ""My Music"" that's stored on the phone I can listen to all the time.  So if you have better than good/great wifi signal, this app will make you hAPPy ! :)"
Amazon,Amazon Prime music is awesome,Harry,15-Nov-14,5,I order a lot of stuff from Amazon but the 2day shipping is now a benefit to the music. My wife says that I am stuck in the 70's when it comes to music but I do like 50's and 60's rock and roll too. I have put almost 700 songs in my music library and I ain't done yet. Thanks to my iPhone and my tablet and my awesome Bluetooth speaker I can take my favorite music anywhere. Amazon Prime is worth the cost just for the music and the videos.
Amazon,Three Stars,Amazon Customer,24-Jun-16,3,It's good but not enough music to choose from.
Amazon,This is a great service,Barbara Cole,4-Feb-16,5,"This is a great way to listen to music you already love, and stumble across new music you will grow to love.  It's also a fun way to find those hidden gems from your past that you'd forgotten about.  I can listen in a bunch of places, and even got a lot of nursery rhymes downloaded to play for my twins wherever we are!"
Amazon,Generally good app,Laura Lindle,23-Mar-16,3,"I listen to this app daily. It is lacking some functionality, but creating playlists is super easy. This app would be better of you could select the music folder to pull from (on an sd card). Also, the last patch broke the continuous repeat one song function. The song only repeats once and then app closes."

Amazon,No sign in page,myers86,12-Jan-17,1,With the updates I can no longer access anything through any of the Amazon apps. It will not bring up the sign in page just sits there on a blank white screen.

Amazon,"Nice to not hear ads, but pre-mixed playlists aren't the best.",Jason,3-Jul-15,3,"Should recommend other songs similar to what you're listening to. Also, most radio/playlists suck. Switched to Google Play because they have free playlists (with ads) but a great Gym mix. Step up your game Amazon! I pretty much give them 1/2 my paycheck every two weeks because I love Amazon stuff. This isn't doing it for me though... but I'm sure they'll algorithm it out soon."

Fairly intuitive, one-button play for each playlist - hopefully the available music list will grow!"

Amazon,Okay compared to other streaming services,Haans,20-Jun-14,3,"So this is part of my Prime Membership.  It is just fine for listening to individual songs or albums. Audio quality is excellent, (something one of the other major streaming services does not really care about.)Why is it just okay?  Because it is not superior when it comes to playlists.  The playlists are okay, but short compared to other services.  Not something you can just pick and forget for hours of listening.  Also the choices of genres need to be expanded."

However, once I discovered the amount and variety of free music that is available to me on Amazon Prime Music I think that membership is an extremely good deal.

Amazon,not user friendly,wes wylie,30-Jun-16,1,Hard to get to the music difinitely not user friendly... Very limited selection of music in the playlist/genere... I'll stay with Pandora...
Amazon,unexpectedly became my favorite MP3 player on Android,Mark my words,8-Nov-11,5,"The main reason I like the Amazon MP3 player is that it has the best fast-forward/rewind controls for long tracks such as podcasts or audio books.  All the other player either skip too-large sections, or otherwise are not workable for long tracks.The ability to access tracks in my cloud is also nice."
Amazon,Great music app,Amazon Customer,7-Jan-17,5,Love this app. Let's me listen to whatever I want and recommends songs I actually like.
Amazon,I love you can get albums downloaded to prime account and ...,Mia,20-Jan-16,5,"I love you can get albums downloaded to prime account and then I can listen to music when I'm on my Kindle for free! I wish they had more of the albums that I liked on prime, but it's great!"
Amazon,Very good product,Peter,23-Dec-13,5,"Easier than i-tunes or notoriously confusing Winamp or MS medial player libraries.  However, the quality of cataloging the songs or albums solely depends on quality of mp3 ID tags.  Sometimes, the songs from the compilation albums may be split over several albums, and that's only because the ID tags associate the file with particular album.  If you are to load your own library of albums anything can happen.  However, the Mp3s downloaded from Amazon, whether the albums or compilations,  require no action in fixing ID tags."
Amazon,I love Amazon music,Radha,10-May-16,5,I love Amazon music. I can access so many albums and soundtracks without feeling obligated to buy anything. I don't use the radio function much but it works fine. This essentially feels like spotify without having to pay for a separate service as I already pay for amazon prime to begin with.

Amazon,Not to bad..,Michelle N.,15-Jun-16,5,Really like it. I just wish they had more music choices in Prime. I've had to buy alot of the songs I like because they weren't listed in Prime.
Amazon,Good Deal at $3.99 a month for music on the Amazon Echo,Amazon Customer,31-Oct-16,4,Well worth the $3.99 a month for music on our Amazon Echo. I've asked Echo to play some songs I thought it wouldn't have and Amazon Music Unlimited has found every one of them. If you've got an Echo I'd say try it for this price it's a good deal!
Amazon,Why isn't there a non-prime version for older phones?,Jon-Paul Smith,17-Jul-14,1,Well with the latest update this app is no longer compatible with my phone. It would be great if the old version were available so I could download and play the music I purchased without having to buy... yet another phone. I understand that the addition of prime music might necessitate an upgrade but locking me out of music I paid for is very disillusioning.
Amazon,More music than you can listen to in a lifetime!,Amazon Customer D K,19-Jun-14,5,"I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I wasn't too worried about having enough music to listen to.  However, the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites.  I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out.  The catalog from some of the top labels are not available, but it is still an impressive collection!"
Amazon,Thank Heaven for Amazon Prime and the Music App.,C. Wilson,27-Jan-17,5,"I love the Amazon Music app! I thoroughly enjoy all the music that is right at my fingertips whenever I want.  Makes time spent in the car much more tolerable, chills me out in the evening, etc.  Now I can't imagine being without it."
Amazon,Five Stars,April Woodward,15-Apr-17,5,Love that it includes some free music with prime. I would rather listen and then buy.
Amazon,it stinks!,Amazon Customer,29-Jun-16,2,"I would rather it have gone to my play music app but I didn't have a choice. It took forever to figure out what happened to my downloads. Then I listened which went fine but once I got out, I couldn't find it again. There is no icon. Still haven't found it. I hate this program!"

Amazon,Cant find my music,Bloodhound,30-Jul-16,4,"I chose my prime songs, went to download them like normal, it says they down load, to where? There's no option to chose where to save music to on this app, not that I can find anymore. I would like to have my music on my phone, I don't use clouds or streaming stations."
Amazon,This is a great music service,Kindle Customer,3-May-15,4,"This is a great music service. I like how you can skip songs as much as you want, as well as having the ability to go back to a previous song. So far I'm very impressed with the assortment of songs."
Amazon,AMAZON MP3 ; A GREAT PRODUCT,carolyn bennett-crite,11-Dec-12,5,"I LOVE AMAZON MP3 PRODUCT . I Download mp3's from Amazon.  This is a free product to download to help store my music  & retreive it later for use on other computers or devices like my Android phone.  I can even transfer my music from my cloud player to my device.  I can't compare it to other similar products, because this is my first product I use to download & store my music.  I am a beginner, but it's easy to use. I have lost music on my computer, but i was able to log on to amazon site, sign in & reteive music from past & future purchases.  I plan to continue using this product.  THANKS AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Amazon,I was really excited because I have a SONOS whole house sound system and it would be wonderful to have access to this music libr,Robert W Becker,5-Jul-15,3,"Prime Music  is advertised as having millions of free songs. I was really excited because I have a SONOS whole house sound system and it would be wonderful to have access to this music library. When I went to play Amazon Prime Music on SONOS it only allows me to play Purchased or Uploaded music. I don't get it, I can play thru Bluetooth Speaker but not my WIFI Speakers???"
Amazon,Easy to navigate,Vhaine,20-Jan-16,5,Easy to navigate.  Great selection.  Really loved that you can synch your music to the device.  Curated channels are a bonus.  I also enjoy creating my own mixes.  Great addition to Prime.

Amazon,The app turns my boring phone into a music making machine,Sheol,19-Apr-16,4,"The app turns my boring phone into a music making machine, however, the app drains the battery more than any other app I have installed.  Given this only drawback, it is still way better than any other music app, even though I'm paying for this service and most of the other music apps are free."

Amazon,Absolutely love listening to Amazon Music,Amazon Customer,23-Feb-17,5,Absolutely love listening to Amazon Music. Any type of music you can find on Amazon prime exceptional app for music lovers  I would definitely recommend
Amazon,It went into external drives,Linda,24-Apr-13,2,"As the subject line says, I had CD's copied on 2 external drives totaling 18G as well  as music on my C drive and it turned all the CD music on my external drives and the C drive into MP3 files. Now I have to recopy all my music, approx 22G to make CD's to play in my car. I or computer. It had no business changing the music I had put on these drives. I don't like the thought one bit of copying all my music back. They should put someway to convert MP3 back into CD's again. Now if you buy MP3 music that should stay the way it was purchased. Leave original music on the computer alone!!"

Amazon,Five Stars,robert baker,25-May-16,5,I like it. It's a great app. Especially  when I'm at driving at work.
Amazon,They added dates to the album info,Walter W Westfall,6-May-17,5,I contacted Amazon about how nice it is to be able to see the year an album was released and within weeks the android app did this. Excellent customer service and proof they listen!
Amazon,I hope it seems easier with time.,NanaB,21-Nov-14,1,I'm finding it difficult to navigate so far. I'm having difficulty using my music from the cloud amazon library on my android.

I now can listen good music in my Android cellphone too. (I own Prime membership, so I wonder everyone can have free music without it)."
Amazon,App sucks!,steve,4-Oct-17,1,"This app sucks. If you've downloaded music to the app, you won't get it to your phone storage (sd card ) so friggin user unfriendly. I hate it"

Amazon,Good listening solution for me!!,Don O,31-Dec-15,5,Really like this app.  I like being able to listen to my selections while I am working on the computer.  I have a bluetooth device that pairs my hearing aids with my computer.  I can hear the music just fine but no one else does!!  Haven't had time yet to explore all of the music available.  Looking forward to doing it!!
Amazon,Buy what you like to hear,Amazon Customer,2-Feb-16,5,"I was raised in a period when the singer could be heard singing and be understood what singer was saying. I love the period of 50 through 70. I am able to purchase the songs by original singer,and not buy a album for only few songs.l can get this through amazon and store in clouds or library and listen any time."
Amazon,Love the variety,Missy,26-Jul-16,3,Love the wide selection but thumbs down for not being able to stream my library or playlists off-line as promised. Unless I am connected to Wi-Fi. Fix this bug and I would give it 5 stars.

Amazon,LOVE IT,Fred,29-Mar-15,5,"I am not a tech geek and have really not kept up with all the new stuff - but this is amazing.  I like I-Heart radio and thought that was good, but to be able to pick my own individual songs (and album if needed) is a wonderful way of creating a playlist just for me!!!  LOVE IT"

I am a US customer, with a US account, a US credit card, a US billing address, and US 1-Click settings....",Johnny P Gibbons,5-Jun-13,1,"...but when I am working in Canada I cannot purchase music!  Fix this please.Also, I can't believe this isn't available to Canadians, if you want to make $$$ open this up to Canadians.  For Android users there's no options to purchase music like iPhone/iTunes users can.  Get with the times man!"
Amazon,So so,Amazon Customer,21-Jan-17,3,It works decently but pushes to much for unlimited. Difficult to get music set up when your  wife has primary email on a family account and you're the second email account. Unlike most amazon products it feels like a money grab.
Amazon,Worth the price of admission!,William Hayse,4-Feb-16,4,The streaming music and video services of Amazon are worth the annual fee. It is like the free 2 day shipping is just a nice additional bonus!The music selection and sound quality are very good. I get a few skips and drops on occasion but that is the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.
Amazon,Pandora's better!,Amazon CustomerTOMOL,3-Jun-16,3,"Very difficult to maneuver, unlike Pandora.  Also, unlike Pandora, there's no-one to speak to for help and Amazon's electronic help is useless!"
Amazon,Very Annoying Synching Problem!!!,J u n i o r,25-Apr-15,2,"Everytime I played a song it stops 2 or 3 times to ""synch""!!! This is very annoying and distracting and prevents me from enjoying my favorite songs. I did not become a subscriber to be very annoyed. Pandora and Slacker does not ""synch"" why can't you do the same?I am giving you a month to fix this problem and if it stays the same consider my subscription cancelled!"

Amazon,All the music you ever wanted,Tyler Robertson,15-Mar-16,5,All the latest music available and for the people in love with the past will love all the choices they have from yesterday's hits. You can store everything simply to your devices and have wherever u go. I don't like that you cannot download and store the music to a SD card other than that great app.
Amazon,"Works 60 percent of the time, everytime",Anne,14-Dec-16,3,"This crashes a few times daily on Chrome. The orange amazon music app on my computer (not browser) updated and has not worked since the last update over a month ago (crashes upon opening). When it works, I do enjoy it thoroughly!"
Amazon,nice to download for offline listening,Abj,30-Aug-17,4,"Limited library, if you only have prime. nice to download for offline listening."
Amazon,Can't download music to SD Card or use with Ford Sync,M. Miller,20-Aug-14,1,"Amazon Music gets 1 star for two reasons. First, because it seems I can no longer download MY music to the SD card on my phone. If I want to download music, it has to be directly to the phone. In the FAQ's in the app, it says that this option is available only on some phones that run Lollipop and KitKat. I just got a new phone that's running Marshmallow, so the option to download music to the SD card is grayed out. I don't choose to clog my phone up with music downloads, or alternatively use up my data streaming it. What is the problem, Amazon? Fix this.Another issue is that it no longer works with the current version of Ford Sync. There's an option in the app settings that lets Sync control the app through voice activation. If you check that box, Amazon Music crashes. Every single time. I contacted Amazon about this but got no response."
Amazon,Music pauses every 2-3 songs forcing me to stop my run to resume play,L. Marshall,23-Jan-16,3,"just started using Amazon Music when I run.....having issues with it pausing after every 2nd song or so....might be an issue with my phone, but i don't have this problem with Pandora."
Amazon,and great audio quality,AlphaQuant,17-Nov-14,4,"Huge selection, and great audio quality.  The user interface is a bit perplexing, and takes some getting used to, and that is why i didn't give it 5 stars.  Otherwise great app!Example of the difficult user interface, Hard to find equalizer settings, forward/rev/play buttons sometimes hide depending on the screen.  I think it would be nice if those adjustment controls would be fixed regardless where you navigate."

Amazon,Extremely limited selection,Metcalfe,28-Aug-15,1,Amazon has an extremely limited selection of music compared to Google play music. I tried prime just for streaming music selection trying to save $30/year on music subscription but with the poor selection on Amazon I'm gonna stick with Google.
Amazon,What is it supposed to do ?,Live to Ride,5-Dec-15,1,Have it on kindle HDX 7. Try to play prime music automatically says I have to use this app and takes me a screen that just has a lovely little circle rotating and rotating ( an hour so far) and nothing. No music . Amazon is something wrong with you. You're no longer user friendly and obviously don't read reviews of your apps
Amazon,"had to cancel after the initial monthly fee, they ...",michiganmiss,8-Nov-17,2,"had to cancel after the initial monthly fee, they want to charge for downloads and more.  now that I canceled my membership, all my favorites and all the music I put time into finding disappeared."
Amazon,used to like...not so much now,Amazon Customer,4-Jul-14,2,"I have used this app for quite some time. It came installed on my phone as Amazon MP3. I was pleased with the selection and being able to download my purchases to my phone and syncing it with other play lists previously created. Now, with it being the prime music, I can no longer sync it. So now I have to use two different apps to listen to music...DISLIKE!!!Amazon- please go back to letting us download to our devices so we can use only 1 playlist!"
Amazon,Five Stars,Lanette Etzkorn,30-Jul-17,5,It is so easy and so many song to choose from that are free
Amazon,Very poorly designed,susananne,31-Mar-15,2,This app (on a Samsung G4) is very poorly designed.  I still can't figure out how to close the app after I start it.  There is an option (in the app) to clear the cache and this stops the player.  But...why isn't there an option to close.  Also (as others have mentioned) the songs are never actually downloaded.  They stay in the cloud so you will use your data minutes every time you run it.
Amazon,Amazon  music with prime,Mrs B,19-Sep-16,5,I  had this app  & my  phone  sent me  an update  so I  did it however  after the update  the app  went away  & I  purchased a lot of music  from you  all  through  this  app  & now I have  no way of retrieving  it are you  able to help with my issue

Amazon,Fav music app,Whitney G.,12-Jun-16,4,I love prime music because it has a variety of music. Some songs aren't in their library yet but there's enough there to keep you occupied
Amazon,Room for improvement but good nonetheless,Jen,10-Aug-11,3,"The cool thing about the MP3 app is the Cloud  service and the store has some of the music I listen to, is relatively cheaper than iTunes. Cloud service is cool. I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future. Oh I am using the Motorola Atrix."
Amazon,It's kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based ...,Olivier Labrie,25-Apr-16,4,It's kinda cool. It has feature like pre loaded Playlist based on artist or genre. I'm taking off one star because the random with the same style of artist isn't very good.  Odd combination of artists and not keeping the same vibe sing after song... As an add-on to prime it's excellent.

Amazon,I like the service as a Prime member,Lincoln,19-Oct-16,3,"I wish there were a way it would help me build playlists from my own music collection but aside from that, I like the service as a Prime member.

Amazon,Could be a great service...,Rich Varga,6-Aug-14,2,"I have been using this service for about a month now and it has not been as easy to use as Spotify or Google music.  I paid for the upgrade to storage space, but it is not allowing me to upload my music from home.  It worked for the bit that was on my laptop but it is just not an intuitive system at this point.  As I paid for extra music storage space I am hopeful this is resolved soon, it could be a great way for me to store and listen to my music!"

I get the Amazon music app to purchase music from Amazon, now I get this prime muisic garbage that keeps popping up.  Why did Ispend money on a product that just shows ads?Like the Amazon VOD service, it works great on a Kindle that runs android, but if you have an Android tablet, you are out of luvk.  Other VOD services do not require a special tavlet but Amazon does.  Amazon is getting worse than Apple."

While both user interfaces are sluggish, Amazon MP3 player is by far the worse of the two....to the point of being unusable on my EVO 3d.  There are extremely long pauses while browsing my collection and frequent force closes.  I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app, but the horrible lag in browsing the UI is unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this app for large music collections.  Instead, look at Google Music or Audiogalaxy (the latter only if you can leave your music collection pc on all day).  Both have android clients with usable, albiet slow interfaces for large collections."

This app also does not work on my Kindle....Amazon suggests that I do a factory reset but says it probably will not work...
Amazon,Space Sucker,Sam G,1-Apr-15,2,"Loved access to free, streaming, commercial free music, but I wanted to download music to my phone so I could listen without a WiFi connection. Even though the app can be moved to my SD card, the music could only download to my phone. It took up too much space and I had to delete it. If they fix this problem, I'd download again immediately, but as of now, its just takes up too much space which interferes with the function of my phone (to the point where I couldn't update my apps)"
Amazon,Amazon Music with Prime Music,Ramona Hendon,12-Aug-15,5,"Amazon Music with Prime Music is pretty awesome.  I'm sure I haven't began to touch on what type of music can be played but I bet Alexa was tired on the 4th of July when we had company and everyone here was giving her commands, she kept right up with them.  Way to go Prime Music and Alexa.  I haven't tried it in my car."

Amazon,Amazon Rocks!,Amazon Customer,6-Jan-15,5,"When I purchased amazon prime I wondered if it would be worth $99 a year, but since it was our goto source for so many of our everyday purchases I thought we would give it a try. Once I discovered prime instant videos, I dropped netflix, which made the purchase of amazon prime, a wash. Then my son in law introduced me to prime music which will enable me to drop my subsription to Pandora. I love Amazon!!!"
Amazon,Nice but confusing,Christopher,22-Jun-14,3,While it does look interesting it is quite confusing. As a prime member I thought all the music was free and without ads. But it was hard to navigate and when I did find a song I liked it was for 99 cents. I was led to believe I would have millions of songs at my disposal for no cost. Make it more user friendly and you guys could really become a force.
Amazon,A Must Have!,Connie Smither,18-Jun-15,5,"Loving my Amazon Music! It's my favorite music app and I use it all the time, both for my own collection and to streaming.

The whole concept is still settling in on my brain.  I do like the sample songs, but you have to keep pressing the new song when one is over, they don't just play, one after the other.  Dont chuckle at me, Im new to this stuff.....Amazon continues to be a world of wonder and fun, and the music is just another facet of this diamond"
Amazon,Then she got stupid until we paid the $,Paul M,25-Jan-17,4,"Would have given 5 stars but I got irritated when alexa couldn't find Arya or songs all of a sudden. When we first got our amazon echo, alexa found everything. Then she got stupid  until we paid the $. Now it's all good."
Amazon,I've shopped with amazon for years but this prime thing and the music app both suck. And stop trying to trick or entice me ...,Steven P.,21-Jun-15,2,"Amazon music with prime? I've turned prime down at least 100 times. Suddenly I have prime after an update? Uh, what the hell. Plus the app crashed constantly or just stops. No reason. It just stops. I've shopped with amazon for years but this prime thing and the music app both suck. And stop trying to trick or entice me to use it."
Amazon,a simple review,Andy Lynch,12-Mar-13,5,"I'll keep this simple and not write pages of exhausting material.  This is a perfectly simple player with big time added perks:It links to your cloud and almost all cd purchases you've ever made on Amazon.It's on Roku for easy connection to a home surround system.You can add your own non-Amazon purchased mp3s and download the files to your drive of choice for further use.The player can be loaded onto multiple devices that all access your material.To sum up, this is a highly flexible and functional player.  Recommend!"
Amazon,Amazon prime music is worth it.,Kindle Customer,13-Oct-16,5,"I love free music. I listen to Pandora, and amazon prime. I also like music videos, so I spend some time on youtube. Amazon prime has mixed music, reading music, dancing music, and music for any other occasion you can think of. Good app."
Amazon,"Love Prime Music, hate the app.",Mindy Machanic,18-Jan-16,3,"Prime Music is heaven for a music lover, and streaming through the website on my PC is easy.But the Android app is a thief. It keeps self-starting day & night, without authorization, using battery, running in the background no matter how often I ""Force Stop"" it or report it. I have a huge music library on microSD & flash drives & on my PC as well as in Amazon's cloud library.I can stream it through my Sony BluRay player to my with screen mirroring from my tablet - but I have to keep the tablet plugged in to keep playing for multiple hours. I don't bother from my phone, except for streaming music during dental work when I can connect, or on my phone during longish drives, plugged into the car charger.I wish they would fix it so it only started & ran when invited to do so! And to make it actually stop when stopped!"
Amazon,Makes Prime worth it.,Casey,7-Jul-16,5,The music selection available with Prime music has been poor in the past but recently I have been very pleased with the selection and have actually had difficulties finding music they don't have. Prime music is definitely a great bonus to the Prime subscription.
Amazon,worked fine with my old phone but will not work with ...,Mr. J.,29-Nov-14,3,worked fine with my old phone but will not work with my oneplus one. Probably will not renew my Prime if not corrected.
Amazon,Even Walmart does a better job at music downloads than Amazon,Amazon Customer,2-Sep-16,2,Couldn't find the file after downloading it to my phone. Only figured out that I had to use the Amazon music player to play the MP3 file.The least intuitive music download ever.  Even Walmart does a better job at music downloads than Amazon.
Amazon,one plus,I. Kang,9-Apr-15,2,Using the one plus causes a plethora of problems. The number one issue is receiving the #181 error message when trying to play music. Please fix!
Amazon,Wonderful app,Jeff F.,17-May-17,5,Excellent app that goes cross platform. Many genres available.
Amazon,Room for improvement,Alabamaghost,20-Mar-16,4,It would be better if you could download the songs to your device.
Amazon,Drains my Phone Battery!!,Emily,11-May-16,2,I love Amazon Music and the fact that you can download the music for offline listening but the fact that it drains my battery kills me. I won't even have the app running in the background or anything and I'll come back to my phone in 2 hours and 50% of the battery is drained.
Amazon,Not easy to use,Dohna,27-Apr-16,2,Hard to manipulate and get to where I want to go for the music I downloaded.  Unclear where the music is set and to what playlist it goes.  It is great if your looking for certain song to play you just look it up and play but trying to retrieve it again takes a little finagling.
Amazon,Works great,lvnlrg28,26-Jun-17,4,Works great! Keep making it better and keep adding more music
Amazon,It's good.,Kimberly M. Clayborne,16-Feb-16,5,"I was a little surprised. Amazon must have updated some stuff because the first time I tried it I hated it and i wrote it off as a Napster/ITUNES wannabe. I'm kind of a music junky, I need it everyday even if only for fifteen minutes. I'm very pleased with Amazon music. Will recommend to friends."
Amazon,Issues downloading to device,Christopher L. Lacomb,30-Jun-14,2,"I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea, but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it doesn't always work and is very frustrating. If they make it more simple and allow music to be stored to external memory card I would be happy and be able to purchase slot of music. I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3åá"
Amazon,Fee or not to fee....what was the question?,John Fud Zavacki,23-Jan-16,3,"I'm not a fan of annual fees that only provide SOME of the service, and peretual nickle & dime fees for eternity. Either pay as you go or make the annual subscription all-inclusive. Other than that, the music that IS included with the subscription fee is pretty extensive, so I'm kinda just nit picking."
Amazon,FREE music with no commercials and as many skips as you like...,MykDnm,2-Jul-15,5,"Awesome app. Love, love, and more love. Gives you the ability to download the playlists and skip anything you want...with no commercials. You can even randomize the playlists, and more. I just turn on Bob Marley's greatest hits by the pool. If you're a Prime member, there's a MASSIVE selection of music that is...wait for it...completely and totally...FREE!"
Amazon,Great app...works perfectly !!!,C. Miller,10-Feb-16,5,"Love it.I use it with my local Wi-Fi on my Android.Perfect app if you have AmazonPrime, and thus have seemingly limitless access to titles that span more than half a century, without having to pay for them, which makes paying for the occasional title not seem so big a deal."
Amazon,"Always been happy with Amazon, What more can you say...",buzzard 1470,31-Mar-15,5,"Good free music is always nice. Streams to my Laptop and smart phone fast, also the cloud is good to have."
Amazon,Impressive added benefit,Hooper123222,17-Aug-14,5,"Really enjoying this added benefit to my prime membership.  I'm just not someone who will generally pay for music, when I can just turn on the radio.  But I have to admit it is really nice to be able to put together your own playlist and listen to what you like as an added free benefit.  The site has been fairly easy to navigate even for a 50-something guy like me.  Give it a try, I think everyone would find something they like on here."
Amazon,Love Amazon Music,Suzyqk,31-May-17,5,I love Amazon Music. I downloaded a lot of music and Amazon Music makes it sooooo easy to do.
Amazon,Essential app to enjoy Prime Music and download free music to your devices,Andrea Polk,10-Aug-14,5,"If you are a Prime member and enjoy music, you'll want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings, but you'll need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist, album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."
Amazon,Bought lots of songs on it. Very convenient. Easy to navagate menu on computer exe and phone app,Mr. Fix It,20-Aug-15,5,"Great product. We have had this for months now on our laptop and phones. It has kind of replaced iTunes and Pandora for us. Although my wife still listens to Pandora every once in a while. The promo credit for shipping on a longer time schedule gave us the opportunity to buy lots of songs for free, now we are hooked. Too bad that promo ended."
Amazon,Prime Over Pandora,Roger T.,6-Nov-15,5,"Love Amazon music.  Prime music is awesome.  I have the ability to sample most music before I buy and Amazon Prime Playlists are free to listen to, giving me the ability to choose what music I want on the fly.  I also love the unlimited skip feature, which means that I never have to listen to a song that I don't care for."
Amazon,Unlimited service killed Prime Music.,Eric M.,10-Jun-17,3,Was so much better until they launched their Unlimited service. I guess my Prime membership is not worth as much as it used to be.
Amazon,Five Stars,NHnicfit,28-Aug-17,5,Love the music app I can take my music anywhere I go on all my devices
Amazon,Amazon music,Deann Bogart,30-Aug-17,5,Love this app. Very easy to use.
Amazon,I love the variety of music that Prime Music provided,Lena,11-Oct-16,5,"I love the variety of music that Prime Music provided. Whatever songs you're looking for from current to oldies, Prime Music has it.  I created a list of songs that I like to listen to everyday and a list just for the gym.  I love it!"
Amazon,Two Stars,Chad Millikan,20-Jul-17,2,It's got a long way to go if it's ever going to compete with other internet music providers.
Amazon,Generic,Dorian,27-Nov-16,3,Playlist are just okay and new music could be guessed...wish more independent were hyped...how about imports and one time issues from artists? Not even an option to buy...music has far more fast or a lexicon...generic app!
Amazon,GREAT POWERFUL OUTSTANDING MUSIC ALL THE TIME ANYPLACE ANYTIME ANYWHERE,Walter Luciano,25-Jan-17,5,Love it Enjoy it wonderful to have on my pc and tablet . And amazing on the amount of music available that's even hard to find. Best thing I ever did via Amazon FIRE HD Tablet More than satisfactory  Thank you Amazon
Amazon,liked the other app,Cynthia R Paige,1-Jun-17,3,"To much stuff at the beginning, liked the other app android"
Amazon,Five Stars,Frank C Fu,7-Aug-17,5,"love this additional feature on the Prime, keep adding values to our membership!"
Amazon,Beautiful choices are made available to us,Amazon Customer,14-Dec-16,5,Beautiful choices are made available to us.  I listened to the original sound recording of Hamilton with words screened on my phone. To enhance the quality I listened through my Bose Bluetooth.  Incredible experience.
Amazon,excelent,clive,18-Jul-17,5,Love it easy to download thanks
Amazon,I love Amazon Music all I have to do is click ...,Lady Gee 55,17-Jun-15,5,I love Amazon Music all I have to do is click on the icon pick one of the many free downloads of music I have picked and sing and soar off into dreamland.All you have to do is select a song or artist and scroll thru the many selections of songs for that artist. Thanks Amazon I love you guys the best thing that has happened since I've been a member. Lady Gee
Amazon,horrible app,Amazon Customer,1-Aug-14,1,"I dont like the app at all.. I always used the amazon mp3 player and loved it. When I upgraded to the amazon prime music I have had nothing but trouble out of app. Always gives me payment errors when I try to buy music, freezes up and wont let me change songs. I wish I would have stayed with amazon mp3 player and not changed to this."
Amazon,Great music at your fingertips,Donna Baer,4-Feb-16,4,"I have enjoyed Prime Music's access to any hit I want anytime I want it. I have perused new music, classics--lots of genres. The one and only hitch I see is that it's not always easy to pull up older music. Simple to get new stuff though, and since it's usable on lots of devices it's quite handy."
Amazon,love that i can listen to entire tracks,Matt,3-Apr-16,5,"love that i can listen to entire tracks, and play what i want! sometimes the randomness of pandora isnt quite what im wanting, this fills those needs! Wish i could keep my prime account, but $100 at once is difficult.....now if it was $10/month....like everything else....just sayin"
Amazon,I Want a Divorce,Kirsten Karolle,21-Dec-16,2,"I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed."
Amazon,Could do better.,Kayaker,3-Aug-15,3,Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this.
Amazon,Outstanding,Jennifer,10-Nov-14,5,Best site for music ever.  I've never had a problem using Amazon Music and with Prime Music tons of my favorite music is free!!  Yippee!
Amazon,the quality that i get is very bad...,Laura Cowles,19-Feb-15,3,"Pain in the but, skips songs so the qualilty is ify and i tried my high speed wifi or my 4G LTE. Makes me reconsider buying from amazon music vs itunes. Only downloaded it because I'm  a prime member and I got free music, well, you get what you ""pay for"". only pro was the music i could get but you cant download it to your itunes or any other program its strictly stuck with them."
Amazon,what's not too like..,Jack,17-Jun-16,4,"Music ALL day, what's not too like... Only thing I do not like is that after a couple of hours, about 8hrs, music does repeat."
Amazon,I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures,Julia M,23-Feb-16,5,"I am such a huge fan of amazon prime music. I have used other programs in the past, but the selection is hard to beat. I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures. My favorite part is the lack of commercials and a price tag seeing as it is included with my prime membership!"
Amazon,(LET MUSIC BE THE FOOD OF LOVE),leslie dolly27,5-May-16,5,great music selection I play it every day. sick of the Television rubbish  ( let music be the food of love ) my only gripe is that when I downloaded the Amazon Prime Music app onto my Android Tablet there is no sound ?. I don't know if everybody as this problem great pity.
Amazon,Nice but could be much better,Amazon Customer,15-May-16,3,"It's a nice service, but the selection is limited. And it changes. You could put a song in your playlist today, and tomorrow the rights are pulled and you can no longer access that song or that album.  I also find the phone app really annoying and difficult to navigate."
Amazon,Arguably the best feature of being a prime member,802VTSteve,29-Mar-16,5,"Arguably the best feature of being a prime member.The playlists, the stations, the ability to download albums for offline playback...ALL FOR FREE (as a Prime Member) makes this a must have.If you are a prime member and are not utilizing this app, you are missing out!"
Amazon,Bought something for nothing because it doesn't tell you how to use it,DLK,16-Sep-17,1,I have no idea how to use this and in it doesn't come with any directions and I'm paying for something for nothing
Amazon,Three Stars,dottyebran,23-Nov-15,3,No competitive pricing on new CDs. I think it's a little difficult to use.
Amazon,Five Stars,Nancy A. Firestone,21-Jun-17,5,"easy to use, love it!"
Amazon,Update your phone? Lose both your downloaded and cloud library songs.,Jennelle,11-Jan-16,1,"My Samsung S6 did an update recently, and now most of my music library on here is gone. The downloaded ones, and the cloud ones. Yes, even the music I bought, not just bummed off of prime. My google play music has stayed the same during this update. Loved this app until that, not I just don't bother."
Amazon,help amazon!,casey,8-Sep-15,1,At this point and time I have to give it a bad review. The app worked great until an update would only play songs I had purchased from other apps none of the amazon prime songs would play! So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it comes up with a message that states my device cannot be authenticated! App won't even open now!
Amazon,Five Stars,Krisa Lynn hall,29-Jun-16,5,Great app
Amazon,Great App,imamanda369,3-Aug-15,5,Great app. Was able to easily get and download the albums I bought on Amazon. The app was automatically updated once I purchased the album and when I opened the app I could easily download the albums to my phone and tablet.
Amazon,Better than Spotify,Michael Breniser,21-Jul-15,4,I previously used Spotify almost exclusivly.  When Amazon released this app I tried it out and was very suprised at the amount of music available.  The stations are pretty good and you can easily download music to your devices.
Amazon,If you log out all your downloads go away!,Rachel,7-Jun-17,3,"While I am a huge fan of Amazon music unlimited, i learned something by accident that I believe people need to know about! If you somehow log off the app or get logged off, all of your downloaded music goes away and you're forced to re-download it all, and like a previous reviewer said, there is no ""download all"" option so you need to download them individually. Amazon needs to warn people about this policy, or change it!"
Amazon,Will cancel subscription.,Amazon Customer,9-Dec-15,2,"Aside from the free delivery, the movies that are presented are way outdated. And I already have Rhapsody, so I have no use forAmazon Prime music.  I intend to cancel the subscription.  Amazon Prime, needs to get better up to date movies to watch.  Thatwould make the subscription more worthwhile."
Amazon,One Star,Steve,19-Nov-15,1,Constantly crashes on my HTC m9. Had to disable app. Can't even uninstall.
Amazon,Music is great! Once I get it,Amazon Customer,18-Jun-16,5,I need help bringing up the original classic rock and roll mixed that I had the first time.  Music is great! Once I get it.
Amazon,Best Music App!,Honey &amp;amp; Tom,16-Jun-16,5,"I have been so HAPPY with Amazon Music, all of the FREE music you are able to download with a prime make the Prime Membership well worth it! The app Itself works great, loads fast and has little to no buffering. Another A+ by Amazon,  At the gym is my most favorite time to use the app, with my prime membership most all of my favorite workout songs were FREE to download!! I love the Amazon Music App!"
Amazon,Guess I'll stick with Pandora,M Howard,10-Jan-16,3,"Pandora must buffer more or something, because they don't skip like amazon does.. It seems like amazon has to reload the music every time a new song comes on. Not seamless."
Amazon,All in all ok,Elizabeth v  cherry,7-Oct-15,4,"All in all I have nothing to complain about, those 2 apps for video cameras are not working right (city cam and ispy) and I might be taking them off. The city cam freezes my phone and ispy is not coming in as it should, I have ispy on my windows 8 phone and on that platform it works right,but on the android it is scrambled."
Amazon,Does not load - lovely exception message though,natergator,18-Jun-14,1,"Downloaded this on a Nexus 5, every time it starts it just complains that it is not authenticated and errors out.  This is before any prompt asking for authentication or anything.  Downloaded from both the Amazon appstore and Google Play.  Same result.When Amazon innovates (Kindle, One-Click, Prime shipping) they hit grand slams.  When they copy (Kindle Fire, Appstore, Prime TV, Fire TV, Prime Music, phone??) they come up way short."
Amazon,Stupid to give a cryptic error and have no support,Agile BSA,10-Jun-16,1,"Could not get it to work on my Samsung Note 5. Had it, added another amazon app, and this stopped working. I removed and reinstalled with no success. Moving to PLAY Music. Stupid to give a cryptic error and have no support."
Amazon,No comercials with prime.,Candise88,7-Oct-15,5,I love it! It is so much cooler than Pandora. Especially since I have Prime. No comercials!
Amazon,Five Stars,Justin,19-Mar-16,5,Prime+music=what's not to like.
Amazon,"Music is music. This, however, is bundlized with other benefits",Juanita2293,15-Apr-15,5,"The music talks! I guess this is a good deal, when compared to, for example, Spotify. You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free (but not really). Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."
Amazon,Cant beat amazon prime!!,Stephanie Sellers,14-Jul-16,5,"I have really enjoyed using amazon music with prime membership. Good selections and variety. I love ALL that prime membership has to offer. The 2 day shipping, amazon video, and music. It's a no brainer for me. Amazon is my GO TO spot for all my needs"
Amazon,I love it!,Amazon Customer,25-May-16,5,I love it !!! Always playing exactly what I am looking for. I haven't tried to explore it's capabilites much because it does an awesome job on playing a good mix. I do wonder if I can play a specific song that I have on my mind at the moment. Might try to do this.
Amazon,Great selection of music,Amazon Customer,5-May-17,5,I love Amazon Prime and everything that comes along with it.  Amazon Music has such a great selection of music.
Amazon,Five Stars,Tomba,18-Jul-17,5,Works great with Alexa and Echo Dot
Amazon,"Better than iTunes - Haven't tried the Apple music, but this is great!",Greg Deaton,23-Jul-15,5,"Wow! What a great way to discover new music, create your own playlist or listen to one of theirs. Those songs that are Prime Eligible (free) you can also download to your device. Don't know if I will go back to iTunes again."
Amazon,Help system is terrible. Trying to figure out how to use the ...,buyer33,19-Jun-16,1,Help system is terrible.  Trying to figure out how to use the system when my husband is the primary member is ridiculous.
Amazon,Definitely a great perk for prime members,BV,25-Jun-16,5,The fact that you can download songs and playlists for free was unexpected.  Definitely a great perk for prime members.
Amazon,Five Stars,Jason Taub,20-Jan-16,5,This is cool. Like having my own Pandora
Amazon,Used to love it now I hate it.,sub_sonarman,22-Mar-14,1,"I have been using Amazon exclusively for all my music purchases for years and loved it. Unfortunately, a recent update to all Amazon apps requires them to be linked to one account. Now I have to choose whether to have access to my music and apps or to have access to my Kindle books which are on a separate account. Very disappointing, especially when you consider that Amazon does not all me to merge my two accounts into one. Guess I need to find a new music service."
Amazon,Incredible Value...it's Amazong!?,ToJoComp,19-Jan-16,5,"For a little more than the monthly cost of Pandora One you get to pick your songs & artists with unlimited skips, Amazon Video...and 2-day shipping on Prime purchases!"
Amazon,Five Stars,Yinka,16-Aug-16,5,Great product.
Amazon,"Interesting concept, I like it.",Xu Hawj,2-Sep-16,5,"Lots of new and different types of music to try and experiment with.  It's nice that it is included with the prime membership other wise I may not have even bothered using it.You can download a few items to make them available offline or when your connection is spotty, but after a while they are removed and you have to redownload them.I mainly use it to listen to classical music, and I have been able to find three new bands/musicians which I really like and would not have known about otherwise."
Amazon,I like prime music,J,1-Mar-16,5,I like prime music.  Being able to stream and download music is really nice in the car.  You can can choose what songs you are listening to instead of a radio type app (like Pandora).  I haven't noticed my data use increase from other music apps.  The download feature is really nice.
Amazon,"What happened to ""Add to Now Playing""",Amazon Customer,8-Jan-14,4,"This was always a full 5 star for me (I use it on my Asus/Google Nexus 7).  With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and ""Add to Now Playing"".  Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it.  Please bring this back, Amazon.  Knocked off a point for losing this feature.  Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics.  Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music)."
Amazon,I love my Amazon Prime,danielle,7-Dec-15,5,"I love my Amazon Prime.  There are so many qualities about Prime, I honestly dont know where to start.  I get 2 day delivery for free.  I also get free music that comes with a lot of options.  You can also at friends to the Prime membership.  There are so many benefits you must get to explore all of them."
Amazon,Useless and poor,Amazon Customer,22-May-16,1,Useless and poor. Ask to pay another Prime suscription as it says that m'y account is not the same where it s working fine on PC.
Amazon,Love This!,Donna Corvino,17-May-15,5,I love this app. Love buying all the old songs! Glad I don't really have to buy MP3 just to listen & buy all the old songs!!
Amazon,"A great application, but there are drawbacks.",George,30-Oct-17,4,"1. Not compatible with Samsung S7! I had to try very hard to install.2. Loaded music for some reason is divided into many categories for 2-3 songs. This is inconvenient, leave it as it is on the SD-card!"
Amazon,Very Enjoyable!,Jeff Coulter,18-May-16,5,I love the fact that I get to here album versions of my favorite music whenever and wherever I want to! Very enjoyable!http://www.amazon.com/Until-Death-Do-You-Part/dp/1530879183/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1459863293&sr=8-4&keywords=until+death+do+you+part
Amazon,DEFINITELY A GREAT APP.. I USE IT ON MY MOTORCYCLE... IT'S BETTER THAN PANDORA OR HEART,Richard W. Ray,6-Jun-16,5,GREAT SELECTION--- I SPENT HOURS GOING THROUGH THE MUSIC THAT IS AVAILABLE AND HAVEN'T COME TO THE END OF THE SELECTIONS YET
Amazon,One Star,Pam,19-Oct-16,1,"Will not down load, last version wasn't broke,so why did you ""fix"" it ????"
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music,No hill for a high stepper,15-Aug-16,1,I am not able to get my Android device to play anything on Amazon Prime Music.  My PC does fine though
Amazon,latest update makes it impossible for usw in car,Online Overhaul LLC,21-Jun-14,1,"the latest update (last week or so) destroyed my use of this app in the car.in the now playing screen, you used to ge able to swipe to go to next song, previous song.this latest update has that functionality, but when you swipe it pops up a context menu.  WTF.then you have to click out of that to close it, and then swipe to get to next song.super lousy bug.  that alone is causing me to look for another player."
Amazon,Not user friendly AT ALL,Hollis,4-Dec-15,1,"Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better.-It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.)-Search function is crap. Many times I have  typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm looking for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE!-&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again.-Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music.There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here."
Amazon,what happened to just free streaming? Bah!,cathy,29-Nov-16,2,Don't so much care that they are looking for the monthly fee for streaming now. That makes me rather sad. Miss it just being a part of my Prime. This doubles the cost of my Prime on an annual basis. Disappointing.

Amazon,My favorite steaming music,Kayti Mangan,12-May-16,4,Love the playlists based on artist or genera it has really expanded my artist like. The ability to make my own playlists is great too because I listen to many different types of music as does my boyfriend. It's extremely user friendly on my Samsung and his IPhone.

Amazon,Constant buffering,Susan A,19-Dec-15,2,"Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason.  No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies.  Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy.  Playlist options are great, love the music.  Same issue on laptop and mobile.  Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."

Amazon,Amazing musical experience!,Jeanne Elizabeth,4-Dec-16,5,I love being able to look for a song that I've heard on the radio and find it on Amazon Music. Then I can create a folder of all the songs that I'm enjoying on any given day and play them on Alexa! Life is good!

I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies and books prime memberships.  It doesn't suck but it isn't  good enough either.  Streaming newer movies should never cost more than Red Box rentals who don't charge a membership fee.  I'd give it 3.5 stars but no way it gets four stars.

Amazon,Needs accessible comedy.,Ken,5-Aug-15,4,"Decent application, but does not have the selection of many of the other music streaming apps.Sound quality is good.Apparently, I was mistaken. There is comedy on amazon prime, but there is no way to search for it by genre. I find it irritating that I can only find comedians by searching for them by name. This needs to be improved."

And when I search my favorite band there that are. Best music app around
Amazon,"Don't use it, don't need yet another competing source of music",JAAU,5-Jul-13,3,"I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying.  Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service.  Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house.  If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it.  (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.And of course speakers on phones suck.So, Music?I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service.  And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay.  But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.So so so....If you use it, more power to you."
Amazon,My favorite music service,Michael Hios,29-Mar-16,5,"The service is fantastic.  I really love the music selection and the ability to play what I want, when I want.  The mobile app can be a bit flaky from time-to-time, but that could be due more to my phone than the app itself.  This has replaced Pandora on all of my devices."
Amazon,Best music app in any market,Michael Cesarz,9-Jan-13,5,"I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."
Amazon,Music for my wars!,Amazon Customer,20-Oct-16,5,How do I love the.... there isn't enough room to count the ways! Your given the opportunity to like or dislike selections and music is played to your desires. Could it get any better..... don't think so! Thank you Amazon!

I can now listen to my music and I can say that the app is now pretty awesome.Unable to listen to any music-neither Prime or purchased.  I have been currently (as I type) trying to listen to my music.  It's been 15 minutes and no sound.  It's still trying to load.  I'd rather pay for an app and it work than to get it for free and it not.  I don't hate Amazon or its service, only this app."

There is a wide range of music selection as well, and I love the ability to play my music from an app on my phone to keep the number of devices down to a minimum.

Quite a selection, at least as good as Pandora, and without the commercials. What a nice perk for having Amazon Prime. Which by itself has been money well spent."
Amazon,Songs constantly stop 1/4 of the way through,Amazon Customer,15-Apr-15,1,This app sucks. What's the point of prime music of the app constantly stops working 1/4 of the way through the first song!  Forget about listening to any music you haven't purchased. Forget about listening to a different song after the first one stops working.  I have to restart my phone to get a song to play after one freezes just to have a song freeze again!
Amazon,Totally awesome,tfcpe4,26-Feb-13,5,"I am not a first-mover when it comes to technology, so my love of this might be tempered with a sense of time. Some of you might say well, duh! about the cloud player, but having a free digital copy of most of the CD purchases I make from Amazon is too cool. I can listen to those songs on my phone from the cloud player. Wow. Finally a forward-thinking customer service tool that rewards me for my continued patronage. I now buy almost everything on Amazon, not just music."

Amazon,"Decent app, good service.",JayO,29-Jan-16,4,"The only thing this needs is the ability to 'go back' and change a rating for a song.  IE: If I ""thumb down"" a track, it'll remove it from play.  So, if you accidentally hit the 'thumbs down,' you're potentially removing a song you don't mind or even like from being played indefinitely, with no way of retrieving it.I sent a message to Amazon in this regard and received a ""we'll send your concern on to the development team,"" but never received a follow-up.Otherwise, it works great!  Good selections, convenient to use the 'cloud' to play on different devices.My wife wishes we could share playlists/accounts.  And it'd be great if you had a ""family"" Prime where each member could access the added features of Amazon Prime Music, Instant Video, etc."

The shortcut in the menu disappears so if you don't make a shortcut on one of your home screens you will be unable to open the app unless you open it from the appstore. It used to work decently, now its completely non functioning. How can I use the app when I can't even use a widget or shortcut to open it? If they at least fix that I'd at least raise it back to like 4 stars."

Amazon,Underwhelming,lebowitzit,6-Sep-12,2,"The good: It installed easily and doesn't crash my Android 2.3 phone (LG MyTouch Q).The not-so-good: Mediocre variety and selection of music, at best.

Then, you can listen to the songs in the order you want and how you want. No ads and no skip limits! Not all new songs are available yet, but the selection is pretty good. Also, the app has settings that let you decide what quality of music file or streaming you want to use (to save on data if you are using your phone's plan). You also get the option to download the songs over WiFi and listen to them later without using up your data plan.A nice feature is the option to listen to preset playlists based on type of music or mood that you are in.

My latest gripe is the ""download playlist"" button that loads a second after the button right next to it, which is ""shuffle playlist."" Several times now I've gone to push the ""shuffle playlist"" button and then the ""download playlist"" button loads into it's place. Now my phone is slowed down in attempts to download the playlist. When all I wanted to do was listen to the playlist! Rrrrrr. Sometimes I wonder if anyone at Amazon actually uses the product. I do, everyday, and I would love to help (re)design it. Just a bit more attention to design principles is all I ask."

Also ran across some music that was encoded at poor quality. The download feature is really nice since I have a limited data plan and free with my prime membership is pretty cool.

Amazon,Glad I'm not paying extra for it,Millie,6-Jun-16,3,App only works about half the time. It likes to refuse to play downloaded music. Glad I'm not paying extra for it.
Amazon,Insists on loading WMP library,zebras,4-Dec-16,2,"1 ) App used to look good, now it's an eyesore.2 ) When I updated to the new version, it decided to automatically load all of my music files from the HD even though I had this turned off on the old version.  An hour after launching the program, it came up, indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production.  Great.  Unchecked the load from windows media player again, the library was back to normal.  Now today, it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it.  This program isn't worth it anymore."
Amazon,Poor app,Akachan,27-Apr-16,1,I was so excited to find this app so i could enjoy my prime music on the go but sadly it sucks. Yes i can download music on the go but it doesnt help when the music wont play or starts buffering and never recovers. I sure hope it will be better in the future

Amazon,Mediocre at best,D. Bertrand,29-Sep-17,2,Constantly autostart with no ability to stop it from happening. Minimal music sorting features. Errors downloading large music collections and have to restart download.
Amazon,A good start. Not enough of my favorite artists available on Prime,Jay S.,16-Jun-14,3,"Didn't like having to side load the Amazon App Store in order to get Music. App navigation takes some getting used to. Prime surprised me by having some less mainstream material available. However, some of the more mainstream artists I like are not currently available on Prime. That's the biggest reason for the mediocre rating."
Amazon,Amazon prime free internet radio,kroogan,12-Jun-14,5,"NO COMMERCIALS!Download this, spend a little time searching for your favorite music and if you are a member of Amazon prime there is a good bit you can save to the cloud for FREE and play anytime WITHOUT COMMERCIALS! the more music and wider variety you add, the more suggestions for new music you will get.  Even has a setting so the only items you will see are FREE with prime.  This app is perfect.Thank you, Amazon."
Amazon,Worst App Ever - Makes Me Want To Leave My Amazon Music Account Behind.,hacky,21-Feb-15,1,"The app I hate the most.  Terrible user interface.  Would not let me play music I downloaded to my phone from Amazon Music without signing in with my e-mail address and password. HUH?!  This was finally fixed in an update, but still horrible, tiny menus that can not be read at a slight distance (I.E. used in a car) and are completely un-intuitive.  The app will ALWAYS try to play Prime Music streaming instead of music on your phone.  Hello wasted data $$$.  Some artists/songs that I purchased do not show up in different views (title/genre/artist/album). The original app was fine, when Prime Music was added they ruined it."
Amazon,app needs work,James D. Music,12-Jun-14,3,"The prime music service is great. However the app needs improvements.  It's clunky, many links into deeper pages are text only when a button would be nicer. You cannot add items to your library without tapping them first, where a long press should be able to give that option."

The app for my phone does freak out a little though because it doesn't have an internet connection at first, but it settles down and gets on to playing music.  I wish it had more available music though."
Amazon,Wonderful,Darcy,3-May-17,5,You most certainly get your money's worth as a Prime customer! Forgetting to cancel my 30 day free trial is one of the best things I have ever done. :)
Amazon,Ran poorly on my BlackBerry Z30,Alon Raskin,15-Jun-14,2,I downloaded this Android app onto my BlackBerry Z30 from the Amazon App Store. The app did run but it was very sluggish. I ended up uninstalling it for this reason and also because the song selection available for Prime Streaming was not huge. I do like the idea of this though as I am currently a Spotify customer and would love to see the song selection expanded. I will keep an eye on this service to see if it gets better.
Amazon,I am having SO much fun with this!,rebeccar,29-Dec-16,5,"Intuitive, with a wide array of music I love.  This gives me the chance to listen to songs I haven't heard in years by artists who had sadly slipped my mind. I love it. What else is there to say?"

But I don't see any good reason for Amazon Music to be running at all after a complete reboot, much less becoming the highest user of data and battery!!!A recent update seems to have calmed it down a bit, so I'm giving it another chance."

Amazon,Amazon Prime Music is amazing,Chris Iocca,7-Sep-16,5,Amazon has a very easy to use and an extensive library. They do a fantastic job at making the artists and generas easy to find and download. With cloud there is no way to run out of space. Customer service is top notch.
Amazon,"Lots of small issues, not a big deal because free but wouldn't pay for this app (assuming you already have prime obviously)",Ms. Chichi,28-Mar-15,3,"Works on most major devices, but if you have an esoteric device (e.g. Oneplus One), it may not work.There are a bunch of issues with the app, including:- local download process is buggy, some playlists freeze midway through downloads and the notification doesn't disappear without a way to fix it- the license check process sometimes locks you out, especially if you tend to only use the app when you know you'll be offline (like on a plane ride)- the genres are way too specific- the flow of the app was really unintuitive but has now gotten much better - the navigation could use some improvement, there's too much relegated to the left sidebar and few ways to jump around the app from within the main frame- the biggest issue to me, is that I'd love to use this to cache music but use another player to play it - unfortunately, this is blocked"

Amazon,I have just begun mining the huge collection Prime can ...,Lawrence Travis,6-Aug-15,5,I have just begun mining the huge collection Prime can associate with one's musical interests- in my case classical and ancient music. If Amazon can do that surely a more modern assortment must be vast.

Amazon,I like it overall,Pete H,10-Jun-15,4,"Amazon prime is great, as I buy a ton if stuff off of amazon. The prime instant video selections is not too good. I wish there was a way to filter what is paid and what comes free with prime. Prime music is nice, but the playlists are so small. My favorite part is free 2 day shipping, that's super nice and handy. Makes buying easier"

Amazon,"Amazon, you made this mom very happy!",R. Nowlin,12-Jun-15,5,"I love this service.  They don't have every song I want to listen to, but they have most and they certainly have a library that is extensive enough to make great playlists.  My son and I use the service all the time to listen to music in the car.  There are no commercials, you can skip as much as you want and listen to your playlists in the order you choose.  This is perfect for me and I am thrilled that Amazon offers this service as part of my Prime membership."
Amazon,I love music. I had this app on an android ...,Patrick Sluder,23-Jun-15,2,"2 stars. I love music. I had this app on an android phone and it had no SD support. Which made it useless since most android phones have what like 4 gb of internal storage. I've tried running this one a iphone. The app crashes all the time or loses its place and I have to start the app over again. No love there. So this is the big one. I have an Amazon Fire phone. yes, I'm one of the 5 people who bought one of these silly things. But to be honest its a pretty solid phone. So I was really shocked that you have to run this silly app to connect on their phone and not their built in music. On top of that the app stops playing all the time. There I am enjoying a song and all of sudden with no warning. Silence. I can push any button on the phone and the music starts again. Or if I'm lucky the music will start up again with no interaction (like its buffering and this isn't me streaming. I playing the music I ""downloaded""). I can understand the other two platforms not working all the time. I get it, its hard programing for other devices. But this is Amazons own phone! There is no logic in this place."
Amazon,"messy/crowded UI, hard to use in car",Gibson99,9-May-17,3,"it plays music well, selection seems to be pretty good, and eventually you can find what you want, but the dark and crowded navigation screens are hard to use in the car/bus/train.  it also takes too many clicks to get to where you want to be.suggestions:- completely mute (or pause) the music when a text or other notification comes in, or when the GPS tries to talk - right now i can't hear most text notification sounds over the music, and can just barely hear the GPS directions (google maps) over the music.- add optional light/dark themes to fit different peoples' tastes and environments- add a FAVORITES section so i can have all my stations, playlists, tracks, etc in one place instead of scattered all over.  more than once i've had to really search around for a station i had listened to a while ago, that was no longer listed in ""recents"".- add a CAR MODE with bigger buttons/text so it's easier to use - this would be especially useful for those of us with android car stereo units like this one:åÊHIZPO Quad Core Android 5.1 Car DVD GPS for Toyota RAV4 2006-2012 with 1024x600 Capacitive Touchscreen support Steer Wheel Control Screen Mirror OBD2 TV DVR Stereo Bluetooth SD USB Radio Player"

Amazon,Satisfied,MsReenie,16-Feb-17,5,App works fine.  No problems after many months.
Amazon,No uSD card support; no prime stations; no streaming,lochnez,19-Jul-15,3,"I like Prime Music, especially the prime stations. So much ""free"" music (with your $99/year membership). I like the app, on my Windows desktop. I don't like the app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) for 3 reasons. First, because you can only listen to three sources: Amazon Prime Music, your Amazon Cloud music, or music in your device storage. If you have a lot of MP3s, you either have to forget about them, add them to the cloud for a fee, or try to find them in Prime Music. If I had the ability to access music from a uSD card, I'd give the app at least 4 stars. As it is, it barely qualifies for 3. Second, you can't stream from the app to a wifi stereo receiver like with iTunes Airplay, and Chromecast is not available like it is for so many other apps. Third, the prime stations are absent from the Android (and the Roku) app. What's up with that? One of the best things about the Windows app is absent from the Android app? I've purchased a lot of songs from both iTunes and Amazon MP3, and even a few from Billboard and other sources. The Amazon purchases are available, the iTunes and others are not. I don't want to pay a second fee for cloud storage of all my music on top of the Prime membership just to listen to something I purchased elsewhere. I'm only able to access about half of my music with this app. Make it so I can have all my music on a uSD card and play it through this app, and I'll revisit my score."
Amazon,One Star,Thomas,4-May-17,1,Can't get anything out pop
Amazon,"Very unhappy with ""Unlimited"" Music",I Love Summer,11-May-17,1,"Very disappointed in this ""Unlimited Music"" plan. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and really liked ""Prime Music."" When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon. Wish it wasn't so."

Amazon,Dissapointing sound quality,Frank Barnes,21-Nov-15,1,I was dissapointed that the sound quality of the recording was extremely poor. This was probably associated with creating the mp3 recording. Amazon did refund the money but I would question if there is any quality control an if this problem will happen again. I will probably stick to cds.

Amazon,A great add on for prime users,Mark R,27-Oct-15,4,"A great add on for prime users, have found most (not all) the music I have been looking for. It was obscure tracks either. The interface could be a bit easier. I found navigating the app a bit annoying at times. All in all though, I enjoy ad free music for free so very happy with Amazon music."

Amazon,where the music begins!,Saltydog,22-Apr-14,5,"The Amazon MP3 player is a joy to behold,and even better yo use.Very simply,whatever you get from Amazon (not everything)music wise is able to be played on their MP3 player.Single songs or whole albums.it doesn't matter,Download the app and hear what you've got!As you get more music(MP3's or discs)the more you can listen to,and the quality is very good.So please get the app and start having fun fun fun(as the Beach Boys said)."
Amazon,Your own personal DJ.,Lee Weaver,29-Mar-16,5,"Prime offers so many choices in music and can put together great combo's for easy choices in building your playlist. Once Prime understands your music taste, it builds several mixed playlist for you to choose from. It's like having your own personal DJ."
Amazon,"Good, But Greatly Needs Improvement",D. H. WALLENSTEIN,24-Jul-14,2,"For Version 4.0.4 - App gets the job done, and handily let's you access all content. However, player seems too simplistic to me, and more importantly, there is no option to deactivate the app's checking for cloud songs every ten minutes. This deficiency causes the app to monopolize mobile data.Recommend adding an option to toggle off the constant cloud checks, and improving player interface."
Amazon,... is not quite as user friendly as I would like - hard to find and get to songs you ...,S. Supreme,31-May-16,3,This is not quite as user friendly as I would like - hard to find and get to songs you have in your library. Wish I could better explain it but it is just frustrating at times. I love having PRIME but wish this app was easier to utilize.

Amazon,I enjoy listening while I work,Margarita Sierra,29-Mar-16,4,"I enjoy listening while I work.  Only one issue but, it might be with my Surface and not necessarily with Amazon Music.  It takes a while for the music to stream. I have to repeatedly select before it starts loading.  Once it starts, it's good all day!"

Amazon,Great App to put all your Amazon music in one place,C. Cleveland,7-Jan-16,5,"This is a great App to keep all the music you've purchased with Amazon together.  I live overseas, so it's even more important that I can use this in an offline mode without a network.  I was able to download my playlist to be used when I wasn't on wifi.  I just got back from a month traveling, and it was great to have my favorite music on planes, trains and subways no matter what I was up to.After I downloaded the app it grabbed all the music I've purchased over the years on Amazon.  I didn't have to go looking for them, I can play by artist, or album, but usually I shuffle through my entire library.  The app also doesn't drain your battery while playing music which is nice.  It's been working beautifully.I am using the app on a Nexus 5 phone"
Amazon,Needs some work. Interface is boring and needs application integration,Mr. Feedback,3-Dec-14,2,"Not digging it. Whenever Amazon learns to just migrate all these Amazon apps into one like it should be, then ill give it another shot. Im comparing this item to Google Play Music and so far... I have found nothing to beat Google by a long shot. Good luck keeping up with a website that runs approx. 75% of the internet. But one thing amazon does have right..AMAZON PRIME!"
Amazon,New to the tablet,Cathy,25-Jul-15,5,I'm new to the tablet craze. I just got one and have been downloading music from Amazon Prime. I just love it. It's perfect for m as I'm more an oldie person and much of what I listen to is on Prime.
Amazon,I have two questions...,J.M.L.,29-May-17,3,Why must you have the Amazon Music app to listen to the music? Why won't it download directly to my mobile device?
Amazon,"Anti Grinding Teeth Custom Moldable Dental Night Guard, Stops Bruxism - Custom",Julie Marie,27-Apr-16,5,"This night guard is identical to the ones you will find in the toothpaste isle. It comes packaged with 3 mouth guards,  in a plastic bag and factory sealed. Works just like the more expensive ones. For my honest review, I received a coupon code."
Amazon,Fantastic Value,Amazon Customer,27-Mar-14,5,"Really enjoy listening to the music available on the Amazon MP3 player, especially all the free music downloads. I recommend to everyone."
Amazon,Can't Download,Taylor,20-Sep-16,1,I have issue downloading it every time. I can't enjoy the app when I can't download it. Spent an hour on the phone with both google play store as well as amazon representatives and got no where. Disappointing

Amazon,I love all of the free music,Uncaged,1-Mar-16,4,"I love all of the free music. My wife has accidentally used large amount of data playing music from Amazon when she thought it was downloaded to her phone, when it was really only added to her cloud. I would like for the app to make this a little more clear."
Amazon,Great App! Just Bring The Equalizer To The Front.,Ghislain Ajuah,26-Sep-14,4,"I love this app! The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps. I would however suggest that the equalizer be made accessible right from player itself instead of one searching deep within the settings. That aside, it's one of the best music apps and I recommend it for every good music lover out there."
Amazon,Worth every Prime penney.,Marie L. Beaulieu,1-Aug-16,5,This is amazing.  I love being able to download my music so i can listen to it at our lake cottage where there's no wifi.  I also enjoy the variety of stations from Christian to Pop to Jazz.  Worth every penny for Prime.
Amazon,Great,JAB,18-Dec-16,5,"Tremendous, ability to set up playlists and listen on any device.. Great service"
Amazon,Incredibly Convenient,DJDD,24-Jul-13,4,"Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click ok every time you open the app."
Amazon,Amazon Music 5 Stars!,John C.,1-Aug-17,5,I hadn't listened to online music until I got an email reminding me about my Prime account benefits.  Wow I've been missing out!  I love it!5 stars!!
Amazon,No more Pandora,littlespender,4-Feb-16,5,"Didn't even realize this came free with our prime membership, what a great resource. Love that there's no ads, unlimited skipping, and can rate things so it picks out better songs. My only hope? That T-Mobile will add it to their unlimited music streaming services"

Amazon,More to love about Amazon.,G&S,18-Jun-14,5,Awesome new feature for Prime customers. Plenty of great songs to engage the ears. This truly is a wonderful new and unexpected treat.
Amazon,Great App!!,Joseph Fincher,11-Dec-12,4,"I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes."
Amazon,Four Stars,Ralph Kim,8-Sep-17,4,very good and useful for my android. saves me money from iheart and sirius

Amazon,No more music stores,Chris,9-Feb-17,5,"Amazon music is what I rely on for 99% of my music. It's almost becoming a necessity instead of chioce, which is fine with me. Amazon is open 24/7 and these days music stores are gone."
Amazon,Can no longer repeat one song?,Macintheus,10-Feb-16,3,"I really like Amazon music -- BUT -- the ability to repeat one song has been removed? I can only repeat all? Really?? Come on guys!Workaround to repeat one song: Create a playlist called ""1 Song"" and repeat all.Otherwise, 5 stars."
Amazon,but I'm good. It works for me,W. Walker,25-Sep-15,2,"It is not fair that I rate this product. I only use the feature to listen to my music from my PC library to my portable devices. I have never purchased music or whatever other perk there are to Amazon Music. I know I am not getting the full benefit of this product, but I'm good. It works for me.."

You can't beat Amazon. Thanks, Selecto- Ruidoso, NM"
Amazon,Okay but not great streamed music.,JW888,2-Dec-15,3,"I notice quite a bit of clipping, it's not as clean sounding as Pandora running on the same device or machine. They do have a better selection of new releases and you can buy music right inside the app.  Has some strong points but it doesn't blow my hair back with music quality."
Amazon,Works great,Jerr Bear,13-Jul-13,5,"All positives, no negatives. I like the way you can order it by songs, and I also like how it has a link to the MP3 Store. I wish you could download your cloud playlists independent of the songs, but I suppose that's a moot point, unless... If they could make it so that anytime you are playing something from the Cloud, if it would automatically play the next song in the queue from your device if it's on your device, and then switch back to the Cloud for whatever isn't on the device, now that would be cool. If I think of something to add, I'll come back to it. Cheers, Jerry"
Amazon,Not bad,B. L. Smith,4-Sep-17,4,"It is pretty good,  but could be a little morw user friendly."

I like a lot of music and with my previous relationships with devices and porting my digital collections, I have had some consistant issues. This product is an awesome way for me to have access to my stored collections anytime anywhere a device is available, I highly recommend it, especially if you have ever bought the same song two or three times."

Amazon,Amazon MP3 is where the Music is playin'.,~ d j  alimo,29-Sep-13,5,"If you are have an eclectic ear for music, then amazon mp3 as what you need.  I'll spin some Dylan; then turn around and Chick Corea will be pouring forth from the speakers before you even know what hit you in your ears.

Amazon,Difficult to find the direct download,MrsJ,23-Jan-15,2,"I can't import my songs I just bought into any other music player. Waste of money to buy individual songs - now I know to just buy the whole CD so music is portable across all formats.UPDATED: It is possible to download the MP3 for portability and offline access, but you have to navigate through several screens to find it. It is convoluted and messy."
Amazon,Thus Far,Ricky Ricardo,15-Jul-15,5,"I been using prime music for about a day or so and I love it. They have the music I love and I don't have to worry about stupid commercials. Also, it loads quickly which is great. I haven't had any issues with it thus far and find it user friendly. This will definitely be something I use to stream my music more."
Amazon,I'm unsure what I'm rating here...,Dave the Pear,4-Feb-13,4,"I'm unsure what I'm rating here... I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!! Not much ""storage"" space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google..."
Amazon,Amazing App!,Roby Geroca,3-Mar-15,5,"Love this app, can find my favorite music easily and most are available in prime membership!"
Amazon,Five Stars,Jesus Teso,30-Oct-17,5,Awesome Product great price
Amazon,It Sucks!,Gort999,9-Jul-14,1,What can I say about the Amazon music app except that it Sucks! I buy songs individually from Amazon and download them to my Smartphone. But with this new app I can't tell which is on the cloud and which are on the device. It's geared toward Amazon prime music to which I do not subscribe. It needs a major overhaul! I liked the old app. It just worked but this new one sucks and blows at the same time!
Amazon,Just as good as spotify but less music,Allen Kehring,19-Jul-15,4,I like the idea of saving songs to your playlist and downloading them for offline use. I feel though that there is less music than spotify and not nearly as friendly of a way the search the music.

I get to witness the little loading wheel going around and around for 5 minutes before being told that it can't load.

Amazon,"Better than it used to be, and much smoother playing than Apple music, but still leaves much to be desired",Dreambeautygx,13-Feb-16,4,"Well, one thing I can say is it certainly works much more smoothly than it used to, and the lyrics on-screen feature can be quite a bit of fun, and helpful, but the lack of features like Spotify's old Starred playlist (been awhile since I've been over at Spotify) and the fact that it is missing so many good, standard album tracks or that Amazon expects you to pay extra for them? Really?I'm sorry Amazon, but you need to do better than that to be considered a full-fledged music service.Search John Lennon and see how many results comes up: approximately 4 albums and one clearly appears to be by someone who is not him. Unacceptable.And this is only one example.Amazon, come on. You can do better than that."

Amazon,Don't Waste Your Time,Leon G Hebrink,13-Jun-17,1,"Sucks! A bad imitation of Pandora that promises music purchase and download ability yet makes it nearly impossible with a maze of hoops to jump through. The previous Amazon Music format was way better, wish all my music purchases hadn't been swallowed by some ringtone app..."
Amazon,Just Awsome,Richie,18-Jun-14,5,They just made Amazon MP3 better! It goes well with my cloud CD collection I was able to add music I have in my physical collection (the 250 songs ran out fast) without buying it again or paying the subscription fee. It also allows you to try out new artists that your not sure weather or not you really want to buy them. I also found some alternate versions of songs from artist that I did not have prior.
Amazon,Sound was good quality from my Samsung Galaxy 6,GrandmotherL,23-Aug-16,5,Music downloaded quickly. Sound was good quality from my Samsung Galaxy 6. Tunes available for free to Prime members were in a variety of genres and on top lists currently.  Very happy with Amazon Prime music!

I downloaded a bunch of music but it won't play unless I have an internet connection, I wanted to be able to play my downloaded songs on road trips in between cell service but they won't play.

I have reached out to Customer Service, but have not been able to get the issue reported correctly or fixed.

Amazon,just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app,DQW,15-May-16,4,"I don't use it as much as I should seeing that if you pay for a Prime Membership, one should use the service. Thing is, that after you shut it off, the danged program keeps running in the background...just like the Amazon app and the Amazon Underground app. These apps are HUGE system and battery hogs.Second, it's hard to find a specific album... let's say the Doobies Greatest hits and get it to save to your device. Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies. So I'll get my ""South City Midnight Lady"" and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. :o)"

Amazon,Better than pandora iheart etc,JSeaHorse14,26-Jan-16,5,Better than pandora iheart etc. highly recommend... can repeat song. no ads. as many skips as you want. make your own play lists. etc.
Amazon,Song builder,Amazon Customer,10-Apr-15,5,Allows you to receive various songs at no cost if you are a prime member
Amazon,Very disappointed.,Amazon Customer,15-Oct-16,1,Once app upgraded it will not work. Very disappointed.
Amazon,What a joke,Amazon Customer,6-Apr-13,1,"How excited I was to receive an e-mail about a month ago that all the albums I have purchased from Amazon over the years would be available in my Cloud Player - and accessible from my Android Phone.  Apparently, April Fool's Day came early because I really believed Amazon.  I have installed this app on my phone through both the Amazon app store and through the Google Play store and neither way works.  I tap on the ""sign in to amazon"" button and....nothing.  nada.  So thanks Amazon - for nothing."
Amazon,makes the amazon membership cost worth it,Janet kaipat,5-Dec-16,5,"I don't always use it, but it has a lot of songs I thought no one knew of (which are in the island reggae genre.) I appreciate the app and the access it grants to my favorite songs."
Amazon,Its unfortunate that after purchasing an Echo I cant take full advantage of it because I'm not willing to waste money on buying,Amazon Customer,30-Dec-16,1,You can only store 250 songs for free. Anything more than that would require you to pay the yearly subscription. There are plenty of other music library programs out there for free. Its unfortunate that after purchasing an Echo I cant take full advantage of it because I'm not willing to waste money on buying a music library.
Amazon,Works Internationally,Toby,18-Apr-15,5,"This service is similar to Pandora however however differs in that it works internationally.  Advertisements that you get in the entry-level service to many free music services are not present in this application.  Though I have not made purchases through the App, operation of the streaming stations is very simple and intuitive."
Amazon,App not working on phone,Linda Redman,18-Jun-14,1,"Since Prime Music activated and my app was updated, I have not been able to access Amazon music on my phone.  The following message pops up:  ""The specified device could not be authenticated.  Please try again.  If the problem persists, contact Amazon customer service.  Exception #45.""  My phone is authorized on Amazon as well as my Kindle Fire and PC.  Anyone else having issues on LG phones?"
Amazon,Amazon Music,Janet L McDuff,25-Oct-16,5,I am an Amazon Prime Member and I enjoy being able to listen to free songs.  I find it arranged conveniently which is important to me as I am not a heavy listener.  Too many other activities.
Amazon,Love this app!!,Kristen B.,5-Feb-16,5,"I love having this app! It works great and its so nice to be able to listen to music that I pick out.. When compared to Pandora, this app far outweighs the benefits of having Pandora pick the similar songs for you..... I would definitely recommend this app"
Amazon,Like it,Erin Johnston,28-Jul-16,5,"This app is great.  You can find any music you want.  It's not free for every song, but a lot are.  You can also stream stations of genres of music you like, which is fun.  Cool extra to having a prime membership."
Amazon,Nice,B,3-Jul-13,5,Basically iTunes for Android. I prefer the music player over the one the phone came with or any that I have downloaded.
Amazon,Fun but just OK,R. Willoughby,8-Jun-15,3,"Not that easy to use.  Crashes my samsung android phone.  Player won't work properly on my Surface tablet.  But, I actually do like having access to the music I have purchased as CDs as digital media.  I also enjoy having access to some of the music Prime has available for no extra purchase.  It works best on my PC."
Amazon,Good music,LANGUY,27-Feb-16,4,"So far the selection of music is pretty good, lots of 50's and 60's Jazz.  There are some issues between the my phone and Amazon music player but my other devices don't seem to have the same problem(s), otherwise I would have given Amazon five stars."
Amazon,Great app. I can't believe all the songs you ...,ron2270,22-Apr-16,5,"Great app. I can't believe all the songs you can download for free. I have 389 songs and their all stored in Amazon's cloud so no matter how many I download, I'm not using any space on my device. It's worth every penny for $99.00 a year."
Amazon,amazon has let me down,mike,1-Aug-12,1,"i updated this today and didnt realize the slap in the face i'd receive. the previous policy was to buy an album in a year's time from amazon and your new amazon music and your old imported music could live happily ever after. not anymore.  now they want a 25 dollar yearly subscription just to keep my already imported music on there. i love most of the things you do amazon, and this cloud player was previously my favorite. now instead of beaming about this service, which i have done for the past year or more, i will be expressing my extreme disappointment."
Amazon,Five Stars,Christopher j Chamberlain,2-Jun-17,5,Works great no complaints so far.
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Custom,5-Nov-17,5,love this app
Amazon,My new favorite,TomM,17-Sep-15,4,"I've used Pandora, Iheart radio, and Google Play. I like Amazon Music primarily because i can download for off-line use from a very extensive library but like the seamless play when streaming also. The user interface is simple but powerful. Amazon Music is now the only music app that i use."
Amazon,Five Stars,carl loveridge,20-Sep-17,5,Best music app EVER!!!! Cancelled Pandora and Sirius and I HEART immediately!!!

Amazon,Great place to be,Kwaku,30-Aug-16,4,I love prime music because I can select all my favorite artists and songs into the library which can play the whole day. It is better than Pandora because there is no Ads. I think everyone should have it.
Amazon,Five Stars,Christopher Rauscher,30-Oct-16,5,Love this! I listen to music everyday from this!
Amazon,"Needs ""Favorite"" channels, then I'll really like it.",djb,17-May-15,3,"This is a pretty decent streaming music player for my Amazon music content. I like that I can get channels with my Prime membership, but this app does not have a way to save favorite channels. It shows recently played channels, but that only gets in the way when you are experimenting. It really needs ""Favorites"""
Amazon,Easy download to Android!,C. F. Jung,20-Feb-15,5,"Great app, allows loading to my Note 4 seamlessly, because Apple has made it an incredible nuisance to transfer files from a Mac to Android phone. With every next generation of Apple product/upgrades they are ""jerks"" about alienating outside Apple products.  When the life of my Mac is over, I'll never purchase another Apple product!"

I liked the seamless way it also downloads it to your device, but not the the internal memory!!!! WHY?!?!?! I will not be downloading any music or buying from Amazon, there's no point. I can get it elsewhere cheaper and import it myself. Fix this issue and I might buy more music."

Amazon,Fix it Quick!,C. Reinders II,13-Nov-14,3,"This could be a great app, but the last update broke a lot of the best things about it. Hopefully Amazon will get it fixed pretty quickly. I use it on my Microsoft Surface to upload music to the cloud so that I can access it from anywhere.Creating playlists has never been so easy! unfortunately the last update seems to have broken this great feature."
Amazon,Made a 10 hour playlist in about an hour!,Uri Awesomeski,25-Sep-14,5,"This service is outstanding!  No more scouring around grabbing potentially dangerous material from Pirate Bay, not to mention the endless hours taking all of that and making playlists!  With Prime music, just create a playlist, open their pre-made playlists, and (with one click) save the songs/albums you want from theirs to yours and DONE!  Amazon Prime is the shiz, period!"

Amazon,Love the &#34;Prime Music&#34;,Carrie2409,25-Dec-14,4,Took me some time to &#34;get&#34; how this worked. Once I lasted this minor issue I love Amazon Music. With my prime membership I get most of my music free to listen to. I love the prime playlists if you need a good breakup song they have a playlist of 50 all time greatest breakup songs!! I found many good recommendations too. Excellent app!!
Amazon,The Best,WECA,10-Feb-16,5,Best music app I have ever used. Play any prime or purchased song anytime and anywhere even without service. Download any prime music for free and listen without streaming and without service of any kind. Actually listen to what you want when you want.

Amazon,User inteface Not Intuitive,Mark Griffin,18-Jun-14,3,"First, thanks for making the music available.  Ap works well enough if you can figure out how to make it work. I'm not a novice to these sorts of things and there are aspects of the user interface that are just not (and could be) intuitive. The player controls need some work (should be a Stop button)."

Amazon,This is a joke.,Nicholas Garland,25-Oct-17,1,"If I could rate this less than one star, I would. I already pay for Prime. I'm not paying for more. This is almost as bad as the video. I'll just get my music somewhere else."
Amazon,Non-Functioning App,Megan,18-Nov-14,1,"I have an LG G3 with the latest Android version. Unfortunately, I could never get this app to work. It would crash every time I attempted to open it, and when I tried to ""Submit a crash report"" instead of taking me to Amazon, it would just crash again.

Amazon,Stream all your music!,N. Tesla,14-Jul-16,5,Great to not have to buy a download every time you find something new. Nice to find some older lp's of artist I already have on vinyl and cd. Makes it convenient to stream music via wifi to my home gym. Love it!
Amazon,Works great but there isn't a very large selection,R.Rack,19-Nov-15,3,Works great but there isn't a very large selection of music or artist. If just listening to the mainstream artist and songs is good enough for you than so is this. The good thing about this is that there isn't a buffer or annoying load time between or beginning of songs
Amazon,Tons of variety across all genres.,John in Colorado,22-Jul-15,5,Convenient and the price is right.
Amazon,Amazon Music,TY,14-Feb-16,4,Not all of the artist I would prefer but a large selection of music. I have had issues with the Amazon player having static and cut out from time to time. Would prefer ability to use the phones media player but understand why that is not an option.

Amazon,intrusive bloatware,Frank,3-Nov-14,1,"All I wanted was to purchase one song on Amazon. To download it, had to log out, install this other 18mb (android) app, install updates, log in. Now the app runs constantly - mining god knows what data from my phone and: I can't Uninstall it? I do feel violated. Been a satisfied Prime customer for years, but Congrats: you just pi$$ed me off enough to drop it."
Amazon,for music all time,Rusty,25-Mar-14,5,I like to carry music with me and with this app I a can always have a song in my heart and also on my phone to enjoy anytime I chose.
Amazon,An excellent Prime benefit.,Shane August Hansen,30-Apr-15,5,"I use the Amazon Music app all the time on my computers and Android devices.  The sound quality is appreciably better with Amazon Music on a PC than I can get with Pandora.  Amazon Music doesn't have all of the music I want, but the ability to specify which song I want to play and to rewind or replay a song is useful."
Amazon,Garbage,Trevor Hancock,19-Jun-14,1,"Not impressed at ALL. Music is hard to find, most of what I want to listen to I have to pay for even with a PRIME subs. XBOX music is superior in every possible way. Even the XBM Android app is better than this POS. VERY disappointed.

They have a wide variety of artists to choose from and I can continue playing a song while I search for new music to play. The layout is pretty easy to use and their is an option to make your own playlists.
Amazon,Review,Amazon Customer,21-Nov-16,3,Difficult to navigate when searching for a song. I wish the list of songs was m o recruiter inclusive. Not everything is on an album. Artists perform live and AM can be limited.

And that's not a bad thing.,Stephen Hayden,21-Apr-15,5,"As we get comfortable with the service we're finding ourselves spending tokens amount of cash for great songs for the first time in a long time - and OK with it because of all the methods we can access that media.  Perfectly OK supporting artists, things had just gotten crazy w/ the walled gardens over the last decade."

Amazon,Ok but not what expected if you live outside the US,Miguel Cancio,29-Sep-13,2,"Hi Amazon people, i know this is part of your policies but i think its not fair to restrict songs shopping if you dont live in the US. some of us are loyal customers over the years and at least we deserve to be elected to pay for music if we wanted to. I hope things get better in the future. if i could buy mp3s and use your app this would be a rocking 5 stars review."

Im done with Amazon apps. Ill stick with Google music for my source of music."
Amazon,Why is this STILL not compatible with Fire TV?,Dmitriy Briskin,13-Jun-14,3,"Amazon, you are pushing (nay, shoving) me into the open arms of your competition.

This app is for the English language only if it is either United States or United Kingdom...NOT Canadian English.  I'm sure it doesn't take a lot of work to add Canadian English to the list of recognizable languages.  Since I cannot modify my device's language, my only hope is that someone at Amazon will fix this small-to-you-but-huge-to-me problem."

It does not show up on any of my devices, specifically my Kindle Fire HDX. Cannot download music to my device. This should be more easy than what I am experiencing.  Perhaps when I place it in my cart it should ask, ""What device do I want it placed in"". I cannot figure out how to get to where I can download music to my Kindle.Perhaps its me, but I would think it would show up somewhere.  When I go to the appstore I cant even find the Amazon Music with Prime music icon upon search."

Amazon,Duplicates my music,Brandon P,7-Jan-16,2,I want to like this but it's a huge pain in the butt. It duplicates every song that I downloaded for offline listening which doubles the space used on my phone. When I delete it all it just does it again 5 minutes later making it where I have no space for anything else
Amazon,"Somewhat cumbersome, still convent for the offline capabilities.",Arkoni Grace,21-Jan-17,4,The in app search function will not find the same songs that the main site will locate. What the app lacks is made up by the excellent customer service Amazon provides.

Amazon,Great service at no cost when you use prime.,James G.,31-May-15,5,It is great to listen to the music that I like rather that what the radio station wants me to listen to along with there commercials.

Amazon,With lyrics,ALSI,10-Dec-16,5,Great appShows lyrics highlighting text like a karaoke machineGood selection of songs.Especially if are prime customer you get to download songs
Amazon,Does what it needs to do.,Bob Farrell,15-Feb-16,4,Still learning it.I wish it could put my music into folders so that I can manage them better.  Like all Christmas music in the Christmas Folder and not gumming up my lists.The playlist builder is so simple and useful.

Amazon,Amazon Music App Fails,Greg Kline,1-Oct-15,2,"Good selection of music. However, with the app on my phone, the mojority of time it doesn't connect and just spins while attempting to load.  I can search, view and see the music but much of the time the music never starts.  So, I go to pandora or slacker radio for my music."
Amazon,Five Stars,Meredith D,28-Mar-17,5,Great list selection!!
Amazon,This app is absolutely terrible..,Amazon Customer,8-Dec-16,1,This app is absolutely terrible...I don't know why it was even created... just a total waste of time because it's not a music app they have more adds then anything else
Amazon,A must have if you're signed up for Amazon Prime,Cory Balliet,17-Feb-16,5,"I use it all the time! If you have amazon prime you have access to playlists, and radio stations. A near unlimited resource of ""free"" music (i say ""free"" because you pay for your amazon prime membership) at your finger tips!"

Amazon,Be better with lesser reliance on 4G,Everything Classic Rock,20-Feb-15,4,"I find AMAZON music app as a whole very very good, its unfortunate that even with prime - it relies on 4G connectivity (unless others know differently) even if the prime free music is downloaded locally - not everywhere there is wifi access. I still recommend it because of the selections and extensive musical tastes supported."
Amazon,"Prime's ""free"" music is a geat perk",PsJ,7-Sep-16,5,One great perk for Amazon Prime. Prime lets you download or cloud many great selections of music artists all for FREE. I say free because we use Prime's free shipping at 99.00 a year. Bravo

A special surprise I found was a group, or should I say person, called Skrillex. Its all dubstep but some of the songs are highly thought provoking. One song has even been added to my all time favorites list."
Amazon,Honestly my dad was telling me how cool this perk is when you have prime,Chet,15-Mar-15,5,"Honestly my dad was telling me how cool this perk is when you have prime, I finally got to checking it out a month ago, and love it!, no more Pandora, I can put whole albums from so many artists in my library and just list away.

Amazon,Does not work on Windows 7.1  64.,bobba rebop,11-Nov-16,1,Does not work on PC. After 10 hours of downloading nothing played or download.  Where is the support?  iTunes is a horrible this maybe the only software that maybe as bad.

But then my Amazon Echo can tell that I'm trying to play something. It's very frustrating especially since I'm paying for it."
Amazon,Would not recommend,D. Huntley,16-Feb-16,1,"Dislike dislike, you are allowed to tie it to your phone, but I am one who likes to customize my device with new ROMs and so it locks out Amazon Music for 177 days each time.. Stupid, it should be tied to the account and not a device..."
Amazon,SAT radio?  Not in my vehicles!,Adam Halfhill,7-May-16,5,"Well, to make this fair... I love this app and prime music!  I have had SAT radio for years, I accepted it for what it was.  I don't have to any longer.  My SAT radio always had a ""tin"" quality to the audio, but prime music is clear and amazing.  I own a new F150 and have turned on the SAT only a few times.  It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming.  It sounds so much better.  Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription!  It's all there, in one place.  You wouldn't think of writing a check for expensive, poor quality products, would you?  So, stop feeding the SAT company.  Prime is where it's at!  Best of the best!!!"
Amazon,Overall great choice for those with prime,Stephyluv86,28-Feb-16,4,"This app is very user friendly, but there is not as much selection as other apps I have used. I will continue to use this app with my prime service over others that are relatively expensive. Overall great choice for those with prime."

Amazon,"Reasonable app, particularly if one is looking to add to oneÛªs library of music",Mighty-O,3-Dec-13,4,"The app works well and I would have given it five stars if not for one minor music preview contention.  While listening to the short clip (usually after about ten seconds) of a song one is considering adding to the collection it is sometimes unresponsive to switch to another song.  Mind you this is not an issue for songs on the device, only those one might navigate through in making choices about new music to add (purchase)."

Amazon,I am very happy with Amazon Music,Alvaro Villamar,30-Aug-16,5,I am very happy with Amazon Music. I use it with my Amazon Echo device and it plays the stations or play lists i command.  Amazon Music has a very large selection of music to choose from.

I now feel like a bonafide ""tech-pro""! It was easy, and I love having my favorite songs at the mere swipe of my finger. In addition, the sound is amazingly ""rich"" for such a small device.  Thanks, amazon!"
Amazon,Three Stars,Alice,21-Jun-16,3,I thought there would be more music to stream but its only select songs.

Amazon,"Not bad, but has no equalizer",The extraordinary Mr. Utah,27-Apr-16,2,"Not bad, but has no equalizer. This alone is very disappointing. Amazon offers a free equalizer app for Android, there is no reason for not having one as part of this product that I'm paying for with my prime account."
Amazon,Very decent song library.,Carolina,18-Jan-17,3,Usually has the music I'm looking for and I have some very specific song choices. The stations unfortunately to be repetitive so you end up changing them alot.

Amazon,love it,Diane K,29-Apr-15,5,"I can't believe what a great value Amazon prime is. For less than $10 a month I not only get free shipping with Amazon's satisfaction guarantee,  I get tons of free tv AND free music. If I want something particular that isn't prime I can purchase it at a good price. And no contract! What more do you want?"
Amazon,Aaannndddd.....,J in MT,10-Jul-17,1,It doesn't work.
Amazon,Not ready for &#34;Prime Time&#34;,Big E,26-Jun-14,1,"It used to be a workable app, but pushing prime up front makes it a pain to just listen to music on my phone. I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that.  Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews. This makes me think twice about even listening to my own music because I don't want the frustration!"
Amazon,Better than it was. Needs more work.,emily,30-Aug-15,3,"Improved product since installing once before several months ago. Easier to use. Can't figure out how to force to stop running in the background. Also, once you're listening to music,  can't ""turn off"". Only pause. Don't need the ram hog and overheat my phone. Note 4."

Amazon,perfect easy to use,Sara Donohue,3-Sep-16,5,love this music app.....has every song i look for even the hard to find song. I love how easy amazon music is set up and easy to get around. I listen to music all day long and this music site is #1!
Amazon,"Update- This app sucks, find a bettere one",T. Gilm,3-Nov-12,1,"This app continues to suck, now it won't play the sample tunes. I kept using it since my info was stored on amazon for non- dloads and they have a paymeent system The MP3 app is SO So Lame, this app sucks and so does the tech support. Of course they set it up to make it easy to dload stuff you don't even want. You'd think Amazon would invest some money in tech support to keep their vending machine taking in money. Lame, find another one."

Able to find lots of music,  but would like to see a Pandora like random music when looking for an artist. Also it seems the only music available for hip hop genre is explicit, making it a bit difficult to listen in public."
Amazon,I really want to like this app but...,Christopher McCoy,14-Jan-14,3,"Before the latest Android upgrade it worked great. After that, most of the songs in my playlists dissappeared.The only way I was able to recover was by recreating those playlists from scratch.Note to engineering, need to test your product with new OS releases ahead of the release.I'm guessing this problem will be resolved in future Android updates. Nonetheless, that's a bit of a dissapointment."
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,2-May-17,5,Excellent Music
Amazon,Prime Music implementation is a pain,blomster,19-Jun-14,2,The app doesn't allow you to play a Prime playlist without first copying it into your library.  The only thing you can do with one without copying it into you library is listen to samples.  I'd much rather listen to the whole thing (perhaps skipping songs) and then copy it to my library if I like it.  There are too many steps and too many delays in the current implementation.
Amazon,Four Stars,Kyle,29-Apr-17,4,Good music variety but songs cycling out of my playlist from time to time is irritating

Amazon,Amazon did a great service in making sure Black Star was listenable for ...,Edward Durflinger,12-Jan-16,3,"This is all about David Bowie right now.Amazon did a great service in making sure Black  Star was listenable for free.  I'll grant that.  They didn't have to, and that's a credit to them.But given that he'd just died, maybe for a few days you could have put his Greatest Hits up for free?  Because honestly it feels like a cash grab otherwise.  If I now want to listen to Bowie I've got to buy it from you?  Yes I know music is commercial, but this is a free music service we're talking about here.I'll gladly shell out for Bowie's greatest hits - a day or two or a week from now.  Right now?  Might you not have just done a service to fans and put some stuff up for free?  For a few days, and then ended it?  Wouldn't that have been the high minded thing to do?"
Amazon,Great at home when I have wifi,Amazon Customer,3-Feb-16,5,I would like to down load my music to my phone so  that I could listen in the car without using my data but when  I am at home it is wonderful Bluetooth  to my diffuser in the bathroom while I am getting ready for work orsoaking.

Amazon,It could be a little more user friendly and more ...,Amazon Customer,31-Jan-17,3,It could be a little more user friendly and more selection of music from certain artist but other than that it connects in places where the other ones don't.
Amazon,Excellent Value for Money,Mr. P. A. Mcdonagh,2-Mar-16,4,Compared to some other offerings available I think this is good value for money; especially as it covers more than one area of entertainment.I assume the music side will grow as there are quite a few gaps at present.

Amazon,Prime Music would have been great if Amazon provided a decent app for accessing it...,Bill Braun,15-Jun-14,1,I like to use my tablet while docked (horizontally) - This app only displays in portrait mode.  I like to send my music to my surround sound system via my Chromecast - forget that with this app.  I guess I just have to use Google Play.
Amazon,after newest update the app still crashes when playing downloaded songs,Eric,8-Jan-15,3,It is impossible to play a &#34;prime&#34; song that is downloaded to my device. It actually causes the whole app to force close when trying to play such a song. I have contacted customer support to no avail and I've seen many other people with the same issue so I know it's not just my phone. I wish they would fix it.

Amazon,Amazon MP3,Omegaman,27-Apr-14,4,"Amazon MP3 is the best audio player I have tried for android devices. One issue I have with the application is that you cannot place the app on your SD Card. The second problem is turning off the program. The only way I could find would be to go into settings after ÛÏpausingÛ the player, and pressing ""Clear Player."" If Amazon could resolve these concerns, I would give 5 Stars."

I will select a song from a playlist created and it will never stop. Truly irritated, because it was not always this way. It was once my only source for streaming music from my laptop."
Amazon,Very Nice Part of Prime Membership,LynnWerling,14-Mar-16,5,This is a Great benefit of Prime! I like Country music and there is a lot of country music to choose from. Of course there is also Many other types/genres to choose from. Much of the music can be downloaded to listen to.
Amazon,No SD card support and some recordings not original,lizzieinmd,14-Oct-14,3,"I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just OK since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing."
Amazon,Nice it's included with prime,Tony,25-Sep-15,4,Just started using it... I like it so far

Amazon,Download 1 music file at a time.,Tillman Sanders,3-Aug-12,2,"I bought a Nexus 7 and planned to install a couple hundred music files from my Amazon Cloud account. Upon attempting to download 10 files from Amazon Cloud, I was presented with a message ""Linux only allows one file to be downloaded at a time. Please checkmark only 1 file and try again.""Does that mean my entire Amazon Cloud library must be downloaded to my Nexus 7 one file at a time? How Neanderthal! I know I can stream Amazon Cloud music files, but streaming is not available when traveling the subways."
Amazon,Music Made Easy,Patti,21-Mar-14,5,This is a fast easy to use app that brings music right to your phone. I love being able to download the music onto my phone instead of transferring it from PC  to phone. I also love that your purchases are saved in the cloud. Everyone knows how frustrating it is when your phone goes crazy and you lose everything. With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps. It's great.
Amazon,NOT WORTH IT,Arturo,17-May-16,1,Not enough music. Very poor competition to others like spotify for example.
Amazon,Way better than iTunes,David M. Sasso,10-Aug-16,5,Way better than iTunes. Switched to amazon almost 10 years ago and I have bought my music exclusively from them ever since. I have an iphone and I use amazon music player never itunes
Amazon,I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music,SamanthaRae,26-Sep-16,5,"I absolutely love the convenience of amazon music. The awful thing about streaming music is you normally have to pay an arm and a leg for the music you want and if you don't like to listen to the same stuff over and over it's not really worth it to me. The other streaming sites that are free you don't get to chose what you are listening to. Normally you get to pick a station and they chose what songs come on. With Amazon prime music you get to chose what you listed to. There are songs included with prime and some you have to pay for. The amount of songs that are included with prime is enough to listen to so buying a song here or there isn't a problem. Especially, when you make a prime purchase and chose no rush shipping you get a dollar credit for digital purchases. I LOVE IT."
Amazon,Amazing!!,Grandma,11-Aug-17,5,I love it!! Make playlists for my 5 mile walks.  Works great even a grandma can easily use it.

Amazon,Buggy on my device,e2thed,29-Jul-14,2,It is skipping/stuttering music that has been downloaded to my device. It spins continuously instead of actually playing music streamed from the cloud. It quickly consumes resources on the device to the point that I have to restart the device to gain back control.
Amazon,Only thing good was it was free,Dagger,17-Oct-16,1,"Did not ask for it and do not know who authorized purchase. Only thing good was it was free. If it was automatic due to 30 day free trial of Prime, then it should say so. This way, people do not think their account has been breached."

Amazon,"Great interface, but has some major issues design flaws that need fixing",JOC8778,11-Mar-15,3,"App looks great and seems intuitive.  Why 3 stars?  No option to move cached prime music (downloaded for offline listening) to external SD card.  Instead the app fills up valuable space on your internal device storage with encrypted media files.  I'm not sure why they do this.  It can't be for copy protection since anyone can easily copy the cached music (m4a files).  The files are encrypted and useless without playing them through the app as designed.Other major problems:- no automatic volume normalization.  Who wants to constantly turn the volume up and down with every song?- ""preview album"" function for listening to music I would potentially buy doesn't work reliably.  I have to amazon.com through a browser and preview there.- Cannot read reviews of songs/albums.  It shows how many stars and how many reviews, but does not take you to any reviews if you try to click on them"

Amazon,"Well done app thats very well done, but really kicks in and caters best to those prime members with prime music",Greener42,3-Apr-16,5,"Simply amazing. Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were.The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app!P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones"
Amazon,Let me use my other music,maxxl,19-Dec-15,2,When I download mixtapes and other s*** I can't buy in your music library simply because these are songs that aren't available in any music store mostly your app doesn't show them in the recently downloaded playlist anymore wth amazon???

Amazon,its OK...not great.,Sarah,17-Jun-14,3,I am not a misic junkie.  I Dont have spotify or itunes and stuff...I use Google's all access...its better for me. This service would be great if it offered the same volume of songs as Google.  I use Google to pick up current songs to play as I write fiction. My most inspirational songs are all free on Google.  Out of 86 Amazon had 10 free.  Not worth it honestly.
Amazon,I want the old version back!,EAG,18-Jun-14,2,"The old version worked great, and I could move between songs without having to open the album song list.  On this one, there are buttons all over the place on my phone that SAY I can move forward or backward between songs [lock screen, a swipe on my lock screen, the notice screen, and even the ""now playing"" screen inside the app], but they don't work, either on the phone itself or while using it through Bluetooth.  The only way I can change songs is to open the song list, but if I want to listen to my current song again, I have to change songs first.  This is beyond annoying!  And having to open a song list while operating a car is not only dangerous, but ILLEGAL in my state.  I also cannot turn off the music by using the pause button on the lock screen of my phone as I previously was able to do.  This is a basic loss of functionality that surely should have been tested for before releasing it to the public.  It makes me regret downloading the update."

Amazon,The cloud player for me,Nicole McKinney,10-Jan-13,5,"Terrific concept: just what a cloud player should be!  Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer.  Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid. One Wish: categories by genre: classical, pop, country etc are all mixed together so there's a bit of wading thru just to remember what's on there."
Amazon,Household need to be able to share,Jondi Soper,24-Nov-15,3,It is really annoying that two adults in the same household cannot share amazon music. But otherwise this app is fantastic!
Amazon,Hassle downloading from computer to phone,Steve,18-Jan-13,3,Once I downloaded the Amazon MP3 player on to my adroid phone it was very difficult to get any information on how to download songs from my computer to the MP3 player.  I had to call Amazon's customer service number 4 times before anyonetold me that first you had to download the amazon app along with the steps for the android phone as well as the amazon download installer before anything would work. Once it was working it was fine but way too much hassle to begin with.

Amazon,Ok but not a good as other music stations,Angie,25-Oct-15,3,Not too bad but lacks a large variety in the classic country genre.

Amazon,One Star,Amazon Customer,6-Jun-16,1,I can't benefit from my prime membership abroad. Disappointing.
Amazon,Love this App.,Stephanie Westbrook,3-Oct-17,5,I love this App. It is so much more convenient than regular radio or cds. I would recommend to anyone.
Amazon,Great music app,TinaMac,10-Feb-17,5,I've only been using for a few days but so far it is the best music app I've used. Great selection easy to use and I love you can see the lyrics.
Amazon,Three Stars,natasha_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷,18-May-15,3,would be better if there were parental controls or some type of filters for explicit music
Amazon,Very happy about this app available for prime,AbrahamåÊMartinez,7-Jul-15,4,"Very happy about this app available for prime. Have it 4 starts because a few hiccups in playing music. If I select from my recent playlist or station, it will only play one song. So I have to go back and select the play list all over again to have it stream multiple songs."
Amazon,device issues,Calu Gray,14-Jun-14,1,"I have a fair amount of music from Amazon, and an Amazon Prime account, so was quite excited to hear about their new streaming service. Mostly I listen to music with a Samsung Galaxy Player 3.6, which has always worked great. When I tried to update my Amazon mp3 player, it just vanished, and will not recognize this new app. Now I have lost the ability to play any of my Amazon music on my primary player. No lwhere did I see something saying the new app didn't work with gingerbread. Heads up Amazon, there are still a lot of gingerbread devices out there, especially smaller specialty devices."
Amazon,Best music app if a prime member,Donavin N,18-Feb-16,4,"Great variety, I wish they had more of a selection for stations though, a more detailed option of music. I like being able to see the lyrics and download the songs and playlist. Unlimited slips and ad free is the best."
Amazon,Lyrics are great.,Ryan,6-May-17,4,I like how the lyrics are posted for some of the songs. It really is a great add on considering Amazon music is only one to do it.
Amazon,Too much for two songs,Amazon Customer,6-Feb-16,1,I never used it. It was too much to bother with. Not easy to find individual songs. Went to google play store typed in song and it downloaded and played in existing an app. I didn't need another app I just needed 2 songs.

Amazon,Create Better Apps,Basil Rathbone,2-Nov-14,1,"This app is SLOW. Hit the screen and wait for a response for two seconds... Then watch the app crash because you told it to do more than one thing at a time. I download it to get my mp3s then I uninstall it.  This is the case on my Droid Maxx, My Nexus 7 and my Nexus 10. Also my Mac and PC apps are crap too just like this  one."

Amazon,want my old version back,Craft for Fun,18-Jun-14,2,I don't like the change at all. With the old version my music loaded fast and continued playing when I did other things on my phone. Now the music loads slowly and stops when I'm doing other things. This version also requires more storage space and I had to uninstall another app for this update to download. I also lost 3 playlists and I'm having to redo them.
Amazon,Great app for those on the go!,Greg Walker,3-Apr-17,5,Great product that I can listen to at anytime on my iPhone 7 plus.  A must have for me.

On your Android device,tablet, PC and now even steam it through Roku II onto your HDTV and more to come I'm sure. Burn your tunes, store them, play them and ACCESS them from anywhere,  literally. Amazon does it all and here's even more proof."
Amazon,Great app. I have never had any issues with ...,Matt,21-Sep-16,5,Great app. I have never had any issues with the app. Any purchases I make go smoothly. 99% of the time I just listen to the free music stations using my prime music.
Amazon,"I really dont know, _Ù÷¢",cami,12-Jul-15,5,Gone. Never had a clue how it works. Don't have wifi. Don't understand streaming. This got me flummexed. I can't tell you if it's good or not.

Amazon,THE AMAZON MUSIC APP,todddjreese,12-Jan-17,5,I have found the Amazon Music App to be quite useful when I am in a hurry and don't have time to visit the Amazon Music Website on my computer.
Amazon,I like it ..  it needs a better user interface ..  but its free so i dont expect much,vegas massimo,10-Jul-15,3,I like it ..  it needs a better user interface ..  but its free so i dont expect muchsomeone invent a nice visualizer for this or allow tools such as WinAmp (a music/media player) to hook and control the library ...  nobody needs a 2nd rate proprietary player
Amazon,"Better, but...",DWK,17-Feb-12,3,"While the updates have been slow and I do feel the app is WAY to heavy, it is somewhat better. I still spend time clicking the same song 10 times while shopping trying to review it only to have the song 5 tracks down start playing. As a loyal customer to Amazon I do want them to have great apps to support the music I buy from them. However this app in the past few months has cut my music shopping/exploring time in half. Simply put, this app is not up to Amazon standards IMO."

Also, new songs that come out are no longer new if or when they become available in the library."
Amazon,Love!!!,J. Dwiggins,7-Jun-16,5,"Love, love, love. So easy to use and great choices of music."
Amazon,Uninstalled,Claudio,3-Dec-15,2,"If you download songs on your device with Prime music, it stores them in locked format so you can only play them through the app. They won't play through your usual music app or on your pc. My guess is that it won't be the case if you buy the song. Either way, it's not a versatile music app, sucks your battery, and it's not even nice-looking.Only good part is that it sincronizes well with the amazon app and you can import the mp3 already on your device"
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,24-May-17,5,Love it. Eats up alotta my data allowance tho!

Amazon,Its ok for what it is,CAHS,23-Feb-16,4,"Amazon music is ok. I can't say it's amazing. I would give it 3 stars, but the only reason why I'm giving 4 is because it's free, so that merits an extra star. I wish the selection was bigger, but it is what it is."
Amazon,A great start!,Ashley Brazell,20-Jun-14,4,"My fav thing, if you download any songs it imports them to your iTunes library, what a great feature! The play lists are pretty good so far and the amount of free prime music is actually surprising but, I'd really like to not pay for pandora one any more so if there were streaming radio like pandora I'd be all over it! I'm sure they're working on that tho."
Amazon,Great selection of music and streaming is on-par with Pandora,Scott Smith,27-Jul-16,5,"Great selection of music and streaming is on-par with Pandora, Spotify and Slacker premium services and what I pay basically gives me free Prime Video and shipping as a benefit."

Amazon,Not a great experience,Nicole Engelbrecht,23-Jun-15,2,"Crashing constantly and requests to send a report on a daily basis, sometimes several times.Have not even used it properly yet.I don't like posting a review like this for anything on amazon because they have always been efficent and very customer oriented in my experience."

Amazon,Bait and switch,Jane Donut,29-Dec-14,3,"This review refers to the Amazon Prime music library:A lot of re-records (even on songs that don't specifiy it), live versions, obscure songs by artists, and waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much Christmas music instead of regular music.  Streams well and sound quality is good, but selection is somewhat disappointing."
Amazon,"Must have for Prime members, easy, excellent app!",Dan Proctor,17-Feb-15,5,"Ok Prime members and music lovers, you need this app. I'm late to the digital game, so when I bought my Lady Gaga CD I was surprised that Prime gave me the digital versions too.

Amazon,Best music app on the Internet,Mr Gadget,26-Jul-14,5,"Great app. Amazon lets you download a lot of free music if you are a Prime member. I have been a prime member for years and it is one of the best investments I make. Even with the price going up, it is still a bargain.  Plus you get a lot of free movies. Thanks Amazon. I only wish you could make more money as my stock would be a little higher."
Amazon,Addictive for audiophiles,Virginia Yank,9-Aug-16,5,Huge selection especially of music from the 60's - 80's. Prices are good if you need to buy them but with Prime you can build a great playlist for your kindle or I phone.
Amazon,Battery Killer,Gregory,5-Jan-15,3,Takes up too much battery for android. I don't know why but it always says Amazon Music is taking up the most battery. Samsung Galaxy S4.

Amazon,Just Another Great Benefit of Prime!,Deep Puddle,12-Oct-16,5,Love Amazon music.  Great selection of  tunes even the odd ball Stuff that isn't as common.  I like that on a lot of music the lyrics are also available.
Amazon,nice selections and features for Prime but poor performance.,Micky Reilly,26-Jun-15,3,Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon took over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all.
Amazon,Works every where!,#NAME?,5-Feb-15,5,The Best music purchasing service since Napster circa 1999; works on everything I own. I buy and a copy of the purchase downloads to my home PC!

Amazon,You can't save and download and it's kludgy,LegalEagle,20-Jun-14,1,With all the good music services out there - this is a weak contender.  You can't download and save and it takes up WAY too much memory on a phone for just being a player.  It gets one star rather than zero since Prime members get it free.  The download process from the Amazon store for Android has too many steps.  It's easier from the Google store.

Amazon,Especially annoying when listening to live albums and albums where the ...,Richard M. Hastings,2-Feb-16,4,Not sure if it's just me but this app will not play albums without a pause between tracks. Especially annoying when listening to live albums and albums where the tracks blend together. 5 stars if that gets fixed.
Amazon,3 Stars,Mr. H.,23-Dec-14,3,Not bad at all.  I like it. The only bad thing is it only lets you stream from one device at a time.  I cannot stream music on my phone while wife is on hers.  It asks me to kick her off.  Very bad design.
Amazon,Five Stars,Cindy B,14-Jun-16,5,love the playlist always updated music to listen to
Amazon,"EASY TO SEARCH, GREAT VARIETY!!!",Nan Hornsby,30-Aug-17,5,Great variety of music and so easy to add to my library! Love it!
Amazon,Disappointing...,Joshua T.,5-Jul-14,2,"The application fails randomly and frequently. I have friends who have no problems with this app, but then I have a multitude of difficulties and am left to wonder why. The service would be great if the player functioned properly. But until the day the application functions correctly I cannot rate the Prime Music player any higher than 2 stars."

Amazon,Four Stars,Amazon Customer,28-Apr-17,4,Really great for most music. Definitely a step above Spotify but some songs require the unlimited version.
Amazon,Love this app,Kristina Cooper,26-Jul-15,5,Love this app.  It is like Pandora but better because it doesn't have commercials and lets you go back and forward as many times as you would like.
Amazon,Playlists particularly useful,M J Clark,4-Dec-15,5,Amazon prime  Music has provided me with ready access to a vast array of albums but I particularly like the offered playlists. Being able to select a mood or theme and then sit back and listen is useful for dinner parties etc.
Amazon,App fails even after tricky install.,Anola G,19-Sep-14,1,"Per a chat with Amazon Technical Support, I had to load the Amazon Store app so that I could use that app to load this one.  Then, it still wouldn't work.  They had me uninstall & reinstall, but same errors.  THEN, the support agent told me that it was a known issue with my LG L9 phone... after spending 30mins troubleshooting."

Amazon,Disappointed that I have to pay additional money to store ...,az735i,3-May-16,2,Disappointed that I have to pay  additional money to store my music library on the cloud. I can do the same with Google music and it's free. Amazon music is not worth paying anything extra.
Amazon,Tech Savvy is a Must,M. Monahan,31-Mar-13,4,"First, I had to download the Amazon Appstore.  Then I had to download the Amazon MP3 Player.  After I downloaded it to my smartphone, I couldn't find it.  I had to open Appstore, open the menu, select ""downloaded apps, then open the app on my phone.  It took me a while to figure it put and the procedures are well hidden.  Once I opened it on my smartphone, I could listen to my ""99 Piano Masterpieces"" fo 99 cents on my smartphone."
Amazon,Good Start to Streaming Music on the Go,David K.,30-Mar-13,4,"The app works well for streaming music that I have purchased from Amazon. I really like how Amazon retroactively  has provided MP3s for CDs I have purchased in years past. I wish the app would keep up with Android's features like Jelly Bean's expanding notifications, but overall it is my goto streaming music player. I like it better than Google Music for Android. Now if only Amazon would release the Amazon Video stuff for non-Kindle Android."

Amazon,"Eight (no, make that 15)  days in Amazon Music Store Hell.",Khentiamentiu,7-Jul-15,1,"My wife and I started having problems this past Sunday with Amazon Music Store, which she has been using for a month. On Monday, I replaced her old Moto X with a new Moto X, same gen, installed Music Store again, and started downloading all her music. Downloads were slow and practically overwhelmed my wifi with upstream requests. On Tuesday, all the downloaded (Offline) music files on her phone, about 700, were corrupted. On Wednesday, all the downloaded music files on my phone, about 300, were corrupted. On Thursday, tech support helped me figure out how to download the files again, because up to that point, Music store wouldn't let me download music files again. On Friday, my wife and I were driving 14 hours to Seattle. We verified that, even though we were playing only offline content, the app was still burning through my Verizon data plan. Her phone went through my entire monthly allotment in less than half a day. So I turned off data plan data. Amazon acknowledged the problem, said it's working on a fix, but has not yet offered any fixes. On Saturday, all the free content on both our phones was corrupted again, along with some of the paid content. For literally days worth of trouble, Amazon offered a $5 coupon. It's now Tuesday, eight days later, and this review won't change unless I hear from Amazon. If you're traveling somewhere and want to take your music with you, DON'T depend on this app.It's now Thursday, 10 days later, and the latest attempt to download music resulted in nothing but corrupted files. Interestingly enough, all the files I paid for are good this time, but all the prime free content is corrupted.So far so good. A new update installed, as of July 10, and we've gone two days without losing prime music. And just in case I didn't make this clear, the last two times the downloads were corrupted, only Prime music was affected, not the purchased music.I take it back. All the ""free"" music that I downloaded from Amazon for my wife is corrupted again. Am I paranoid to suspect that Amazon doesn't want its Prime members downloading and listening to free music. Why is it that only the Prime music downloads get corrupted, while the albums I bought remain playable. What is the point of offering free music if you then take it away after two or three days?"
Amazon,Seems to work well. I have used it often ...,B.Presso,28-Mar-15,4,Seems to work well.  I have used it often..
Amazon,Diggin' it,Donserly Light,31-Jul-14,4,"Love this free service and the app is pretty good. I'd suggest that it remembers what my last refinement was (if I was sorting by Artist last time, don't friggin bring me back to Albums every time). Other than that small annoyance it's good.I have Prime so I've got a pretty decent selection of music I've added to my library."

Amazon,One Star,Sunmores,19-Feb-17,1,I prefer high resolution music streaming service than just mp3 streaming services.How about emblacing 'TIDAL' in amazon ?
Amazon,"OK player, quality So So.","Trust the Mud, inc.",15-Mar-15,4,"Predictions here for music that I like were not very on the mark, as far as the playlists went.quality could have been better , definitely has some competition out there . But I would say good addition to Prime membership for no additional money ,even the Prime membership went up AGAIN!"
Amazon,Fair enough,Jeremiah,13-Mar-17,5,So far so good. I wish I could every song that i like. However the variety is good enough.
Amazon,Complete waste of megabytes,Rara Bee,3-May-17,1,Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay $9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay $9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible
Amazon,Love it!,Amazon Customer,30-Sep-16,5,Very convenient!
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,1-Nov-16,5,Enjoy!
Amazon,Works great!,John La,31-Mar-11,5,"The Amazon MP3 app came as 'bloat-ware' on my Moto Defy so I've been ignoring it for months. Now that Amazon has their Cloud service in full swing, this app suddenly has a lot of potential. So far music streaming works great on WiFi and 3G. I would like to see an onboard equalizer though. Aside from that it works as advertised and I look forward to seeing how far they can take their new Cloud ecosystem."
Amazon,Great app with free music!,Nurse Ratched,9-Dec-14,5,"Amazon Prime Music is a great app! It is free, and they offer a ton of free playlists and albums with great music available. I have downloaded a large volume of Christmas music and it did not cost anything, absolutely free! Amazon continues to improve their site and apps and I would recommend this product!"

Amazon,"Great for prime music, horrible for your device.",LAC,6-Feb-15,2,"It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device.  Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up.  Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
Amazon,Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options,Amazon Customer,4-Nov-16,5,Amazon music is the absolute best! There are so many options! I love my playlists and the fact that i can download to my phone for offline use.
Amazon,Amazon music did the trick for me,Scott A. Hutchison,23-Jun-14,5,"After having to listen to more and more advertising on Pandora, I finally gave Amazon a try and it was great. I had to install a couple of different apps before I could download it,  but once I did, we didn't turn it off all night.  And two of my friends downloaded it at the same time and both of them are now permanent listeners too. Good app."
Amazon,One Caveat,Dana Bohan,27-Dec-12,3,"This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease."
Amazon,Way better than I thought,Kyle T.,16-Jul-16,5,"Way better than I thought. After years of using Pandora, uuugh, the ads.  Love the Prime stations for genres. Skip all you like, repeat, great selection for any setting."
Amazon,Amazon cloud player sub standard forAmazon,SG,25-Jun-14,1,"After starting the player i listened to a few songs then opted to skip another. The player then was playing two songs simultaneously. I could not get it to stop. Every time I pressed play, i was listening to hall & oates at the same time it was playing simply red. I also couldn't find an exit or quit option. Never had that issue with Pandora."
Amazon,Good,Amazon Customer,10-May-16,5,"So far so good, you can listen to music that isnt normally played on internet radio which is awesome, and you can always buy a song if you like it i just like it for its better variety."

Amazon,AWFUL UPDATE,S. R.,15-Jun-14,1,This latest update is AWFUL!!! Why should it take over 2 minutes to start playing an mp3 using the app when the mp3 is on my phone. Come on Amazon! Any one know how I can go back to the previous version? You know... the one that worked??? This is a mess.
Amazon,Thanks Amazon Prime music and everything else,Deana,8-Apr-15,5,"I like Amazon music is awesome and I listen to it almost every day.

To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device.  It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want."

I have never had whatsoever any problems, or delays etc. with the services rendered.  Thank You Job Well Done Amazon.  It takes a great STAFF I am sure."
Amazon,Ugh.,IMFletcher,14-Jul-14,1,"This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your (large) music library isn't from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."

Amazon,"Good,  but could use a better interface.",HTownie,20-Apr-15,3,"I like that I can listen to a whole album without commercials,  but listening to a particular genre isn't so easy.

Amazon,Pretty awesome,RaceMom,19-May-13,4,"We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it."
Amazon,Clumsy,Kristen Evans,18-May-15,2,"I was really excited about Amazon developing this service. Then I tried it. It is overly complicated to use, has a clumsy, non-intuitive interface, crashes on my Samsung S5 phone regularly, and has issues streaming consistently. More trouble than it is worth, overall."

Amazon,AMAZON PRIME MUSIC RIP OFF,Mike Jaskowski,20-Jul-15,1,I think it's a rip off that Amazon make you buy multiple Prime family memberships to get their music. I don't recall it being this way in the past. Now we have 2 Prime Memberships in our house just so we can each access Prime Music via our smart phones.
Amazon,4 Stars for 90%,LG for the Good,28-Aug-16,4,"Great app, but still only have 90% of the songs I'm looking for.  Slowly adding more so in sure at some point I will have them all, but until then.. 4 stars"

Amazon,As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon,Ivan Liu,26-Nov-14,1,"As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon, its Prime Music's desktop version sucks.  So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms.  The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I'm required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."
Amazon,Wonderful!!!,Amazon Customer,9-Jul-15,5,"I just absolutely LOVE Amazon Music, and with the added benefit of the Prime Music it's just wonderful!!! It's so easy to use and shop.

Match uses a cache folder and stores music as it is playing.  I just wish amazon would provide a desktop option for this app so you did not have to use the browser.

Amazon,Three Stars,L. Shawn,18-Jul-17,3,"I would like to hear more obscure songs instead of the most popular ones.  Otherwise, pretty good."
Amazon,great service!,Juls,11-Jul-16,5,"I really like this, better than Pandora because you can choose music.  I donÛªt use spotify, but it seems like a similar service and it was free with my amazon prime!"
Amazon,Four Stars,K. Tyrone Townsend,19-Jul-17,4,I would give 5 stars but you don't provide enough smooth jazz artists.
Amazon,why,Amazon Customer,4-Aug-16,1,why it so hard to get music
Amazon,"so far so good, but not convinced it's better than",Bob Rice,26-Dec-15,4,"I'm just starting to use this app, so far so good, but not convinced it's better than Pandora"
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,19-Jun-16,5,"Free music, sometime selection is limited"
Amazon,Features are above average,Joseph Guarnero,26-Apr-16,5,"All the features available exceeded my expectations -- from lyrics, to instant downloads (after a purchase of physical copies of music) to the display and layout of the music library."
Amazon,Five Stars,Lopez,27-Jun-15,5,ok
Amazon,Four Stars,Charlie M. Bateman,2-Jun-16,4,Not enough access to oldies for us older guys.
Amazon,Amazon Music is better than Pandora,Jeffrey A Stern,25-May-16,5,"Commercial free Radio.  Skip any number of times.  Many different genres to choose from.  Amazon Music is better than Pandora, better than Spotify, and better than Sound Cloud."
Amazon,worth it!,brandie jones,7-Oct-15,5,"Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!"
Amazon,Could be killer,Arthur Penn,12-Nov-11,3,"Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well."
Amazon,Fix this thing!,Crowd of Nevadans,23-Jan-15,2,"Sluggish and halting. It does not allow for personalized sorting of music. Well, that is not exactly true, you can organize your music which the application will completely forget the next time you start it. The app is the only way to enjoy the free prime content, so it pretty much sucks."
Amazon,Not too bad...,Chris Williams,23-Dec-16,3,"Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."
Amazon,Many music genres to choose for your listening pleasure,Jose Celestino,27-Jun-16,5,I like the amount of genres selection.
Amazon,"Love, love, love it!!!",aklnwlf,18-Jul-15,5,I downloaded Prime Music on Prime Day and just love it!  Enjoy all the playlists that Amazon's created that make it super easy to pick several favorite songs in a similar genre.  Can't wait to download more music so that I can ROCK my upcoming vacay!

Amazon,Really like the playlists and stations,IAN T.,2-Mar-16,4,"Really like the playlists and stations. Would be good if more recent stuff was included but when you look what you are paying for Amazon Prime and all the other benefits, not bad value for money."
Amazon,Love this app,Debra R.,19-Apr-14,5,"I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay $150 a year for the service.  I didn't remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money.I am SO happy with this app.  Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I don't have to pay a ridiculous amount (or anything at all) to use this service."

Amazon is currently refunding  $12.96 but I decided to keep CD because I like it and found another case for it. Please keep the $12.96! I could not find a way to ""cancel"" my ""cancel"". Thank you!"

Amazon,some of the groups I like aren't allowing their material to be offered to stream,F. Wayne West,22-Jun-16,4,"The only complaint I have is at times it lags & the buffering wheel just inherently spins... waiting for that hamster to croak. The other complaints have nothing to do with the app or Amazon. There are a lot of obscure groups that I listen to, most of which are not in the library. some of the groups I like aren't allowing their material to be offered to stream. Therefore, THEY, groups like Metallica, can pucker up and... well, let's keep this age appropriate & kid friendly.Be prepared for music streaming to suck up some data. I use this while at work with my Bluetooth & it keeps the OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD voices in the office masked. I use it while mowing the lawn with my Beats which makes that 1 1/2 hour go by REALLY fast. This app is well worth the time to install and the music you can find from your favorite artists is worth searching for. Once you build your streaming library, it's an awesome tool to have for those ""I NEED SOME METAL TO SHUT THIS @$$&%$ UP"" moments."
Amazon,"Close, but no cigar.",Amazon Customer,20-Jun-14,3,"Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music. I would think my $99 per year would allow me to also download free music. There are many music players out there with free streaming, and some (Tunee) with free downloads."
Amazon,Solid addition to Prime,Eric Bonshock,9-Jul-15,4,"Not quite as good as Google Play Music as far as subscription services go, but it is not a bad addition to Amazon Prime. Who can complain about free music, let's be honest, I purchased prime for the shipping aspect, not the instant video or the music."
Amazon,Iheartradio has nothing on prime music,Daniel C. Herrera,15-Aug-15,5,"With prime I can download every song I want to listen to, no ads, not a limited number of skips every hour. Everything from old school to modern music. Wish this would have come out earlier. Iheartradio and definitely Pandora you're slacking."

Amazon,Easy to use but...,Marcos,24-Jun-15,3,"Easy to use but requires some improvements:- Exit option. Application still running all the time.- Usage of SD card storage. Currently the application use device storage to keep offline music. A few albums will full device space. Offline files are DRM protected. They could be stored in SD without any problem.- Clear SD space. After removing offline music the application does not remove files from storage.- Optimize memory consumption. I own a Samsung S4. This application use more memory than similar applications, reaching almost 100% memory usage.I hope Amazon implement these improvements soon."

Amazon,Could be better.,Thomas Beavers,18-Jul-15,3,Amazon prime music app still needs to be polished up. It is not very intuitive. It does not always do what I was expecting. Also I would like to make a station a favorite but wasn't clear if that can be done. Once again not a well thought out app.

Amazon,Changed the way I listen to music!,MeteorMike,7-Apr-15,5,This app has really changed the way I listen to music. So many choices and so little time! For the first few days I spent more time looking through all the music that was available than I did listening to the music. Definitely one of the things that makes Amazon Prime a good deal.
Amazon,Love amazon music,amy biggers,11-Apr-15,5,I love streaming music with amazon. Getting whole albums at a time is so much easier than trying to figure things out song by song. There is such a wide selection of prime music that is free for the listening. I am glad that I finally decided to give it a try. Love it!

Amazon,Best Music Selection,Carmen Lagalante,24-Dec-14,5,Prime Music is the best thing I am getting other than free shipping with my Prime memberships.

Amazon,THIS APP SUCKS!!!,Michigan Cliff,21-May-17,1,"this app SUCKS!!!!!  You can;t upload anything- it just circles and circles and circles.  You can't figure out how to download a new version, it just takes you to this stupid page where you can add it to your cart!!  Just put a damn manual upload button on the page for God's sake!!!  whoever designed this app should be fired immediately!!!!!  For all the money they have, they surely have crappy software engineers!"
Amazon,Really like this so far,Ranjen,25-Jul-15,4,Really like this so far.  Not quite as intuitive as pandora but no commercials and ability to skip multiple songs makes this worth it.

Amazon,Great for my phone,Riley,1-Feb-14,5,"This might be free to download, but I have to say it probably costs me more money to keep it just for the simple fact that it's too easy to buy songs with it.  Over all its great because I can access my purchased songs, there are no adds, and finding songs are just as easy.  Maybe one day they can add it a song finder where the app listens, and finds the song?"
Amazon,Five Stars,Bert Winkler,3-Jan-17,5,Excellent selection of music.

Amazon,Horrible since the last update,Rockabilly Pastor,1-Sep-14,1,Since the most recent update this app has become unusable and useless. As soon as you open the app it freezes and causes a forced close. It is so bad that it makes Google's MP3 music player look like geniuses created it. Please fix this payer or make the previous version available until you fix this horrible app.
Amazon,Really Awesome Music!!!,Manuel Virgen,14-Sep-15,5,Uses to use Pandora but now on all my rides (Motorcycle) I listen to Prime Music. It plays all the tracks I've asked it too and adds some really good tracks that compliment my list as opposed to other apps that just toss them in.

The Google Music Manager still has unlimited space for free (or when you purchase music from them). that's where I will be headed when Amazon says my time is up, rather than getting nickled and dimed to death and having to choose and upload those 25 songs. Bah bye, Amazon. my next tablet won't be a Kindle."

This useless app sends me a crash notice about every 2 hours and constantly froze when i did try and use it. Looks like ill keep using apple.

Amazon,Very Awesome App,Jordan J. Martin,25-Jun-14,5,"This is one of the best amazon apps out there. You have the option of storing music in the cloud or on your phone. And now with prime, you can get many free albums or songs for free. Such an amazing addition to an amazing online shopping website. Music doesn't skip or buffer when stored in the cloud. Sound quality is amazing."
Amazon,Too little music available,Big Daddy and Babs,11-Dec-14,3,"Not nearly enough songs available as Rhapsody and you can only download to your computer if you purchase them, also unlike Rhapsody. Many songs you purchase do not include an accurate description. I won't be renewing my subscription at the end of my year. I will be going back to Rhapsody."
Amazon,Just terrible...,Emcee4man,7-Dec-16,1,Never coordinated correctly with iTunes and Alexa.  Alexa rarely would play songs I KNOW I added to my personal library.
Amazon,Leaves me scratching my head,Amazon Customer,16-Dec-14,1,"If you have 8 gb total on the internal storage and 32 gb of external storage (sd), you want to put large files, like music, on the external card. When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage."

Amazon,I am actually disappointed with Amazon Prime Music,natalielarson174,9-Oct-15,3,"I am actually disappointed with Amazon Prime Music, which is odd because everything else Amazon has touched is basically gold. The app crashes and the buffering time is awful. I am waiting for some sort of update or fix."
Amazon,Frustrating,Amy,9-Nov-14,1,"Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I'm extremely irritated with this."
Amazon,Amazon Prime is good thank you very much and i like it,Yamil Villeneuve,10-Aug-15,5,"Amazon Prime is good thank you very much and i like it. So keep the good work.Tank you, Yamil.Have a nice night."
Amazon,Great to pair with your Alexa,Amazon Customer,27-Oct-16,5,"Really like this app to select music easily - great variety.  Then I just ask Alexa to play whatever album, playlist, etc I want."
Amazon,Great App,Mjbsgreys,25-Mar-14,5,"Is nice that i can download any MP3 purchase directly to my Android Tablet, instead of having to hookup the USB cable and transfer it that way.  Makes it easier to just move it to the Tablet when I purchase it, instead of forgetting to do so until I start looking for the track to listen to, and then realize i didn't move it over yet.  Nice App."
Amazon,Well i defently liked the service in the beginning but when i got ...,Jeffrey taylor jennings,9-Dec-14,2,Well i defently liked the service in the beginning but when i got a new phone i can not figure out how to load my 500 or so songs that i paid for onto my new phone.  There in my Amazon account on my computer.  But will not load into my new phone.  This sucks because i spent alot of money
Amazon,Excellent service,Chris Shaw,28-Aug-16,5,"This is a great add-on service for us. Driving down the road, wanting to hear some old album? OPpen Amazon music and stream via BT to your car!"
Amazon,Good selection of music,John Vermeylen,28-Dec-16,5,I have a tablet connected to my Bose stereo system via blue tooth. I stream Amazon music and the sound is fantastic.
Amazon,"If you really LOVE music, this is not for you",Duane Gilmour III,10-Apr-15,2,Prime would be great if the encrypted files would download to the card instead. My phone stays constantly full and I have to delete music to add any more. I already buy so much music that I wanted prime so I could check out what I haven't heard but what a hassle
Amazon,love this app,Emily,11-Aug-16,5,"love this app..  Once I learned how much free music and even stand up comedy it came with, I never had to be bored while wrapping up my shift again"
Amazon,love this new music option,Jennifer A Evans,22-Jun-14,5,"great streaming option for desktops. I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.Only thing I don't like is there is a pause between songs. Might be nice if it matched up so one song blended into the next for sound continuity."
Amazon,worst app,Yvette Chairez,27-Nov-14,1,"If i could give it less than 1 star, i would. God i hate this app.I kept buying the same album and trying to play it but it never showed up in my library. Literally the worst. Do not get."
Amazon,Taylor Swift,Liz T.,10-Feb-16,5,Thank God they have all of Taylor Swift's albums. Which is why I love this app. (Except 1989 but I have that one in my phone)
Amazon,no longer with you music people,Lynn Dawson,20-Dec-14,1,Sorry you ran me away from purchasing music. It is interesting that this dept really wants the site to fail. Your customers should not have to go through crap to spend their hard earned money with you or enjoy a service that you offered. It was not broken WHY DID YOU TRY TO FIX IT!!!!
Amazon,good  music with Amazon,Patricia,4-Feb-16,5,"This is another good thing about Amazon Prime being able todownload music with much included with prime membership, lwith the plus being you can download and listen offline  at no extra cost."

Amazon,Sweet deal for Prime members,Jim From Boston,3-Aug-17,5,What's not to like? Free music streaming. You can't beat it with a stick.
Amazon,Was good once...now this app is TERRIBLE!,Aaron I,29-May-13,2,"This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."
Amazon,Prime Music works for me!,Gmac,25-Apr-16,4,"Absolutely love the amazon Prime music!!  I would have given it 5 stars, but the Amazon website makes it so complicated to find the Prime Music that I get frustrated by it."

Amazon,In accessable,Adele,24-Jan-17,1,I have been trying to put this app I have on my other devices on to my Surface pro. Just cant see how to do it?????
Amazon,I WISH I COULD GIVE LESS STARS,Just JJ,17-Jun-14,1,"I have an Android tablet with OS 4.0.4...this is SUPPOSED to run on Android tablets running OS 2.0 or higher....NOT!!!!And as others have written, you can't download any of this music onto an SD card to put into your tablet or phone. I don't know about you, but I prefer to store photos & music on an SD card so as to not fill up the device's memory unnecessarily. Personally, I don't like to tote a laptop around just to listen to music, and I have an awesome stereo in the house, so unless I can use this on my tablet, why bother????So this is now a 100% useless service I am paying for. Besides raising the annual fee $20 a year, it's just another reason to not renew my Amazon Prime membership."
Amazon,Works great and he is feeling quite smart and a bit ...,Anita K.,18-Apr-15,4,Finally was able to get my husband up and running with something simple to play music from his phone.  Works great and he is feeling quite smart and a bit more caught up with the times.  There is music for any kind of taste or mood you might find yourself in!

Amazon,what's not to like - sure it's not always the latest releases,Lawrence H.,6-Jan-16,5,"what's not to like - sure it's not always the latest releases,but for seemingly unlimited playlists and a huge library it's anadded bonus feature of prime. great alternative to xm, etc."
Amazon,Sounds good without ads.,Labrat,22-Jul-15,5,I have this on my Samsung Galaxy 4 tablet and stream the music on my desk.  People come in dancing.  I haven't played with it too much but I'd like to select several different genres and have it randomly play selections from all of them.
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,16-Apr-17,5,great music app has everything you want in a app runs smoothe and steady
Amazon,It's great not having to rely on a browser,Benjamin Magno,28-Apr-15,5,"Got Prime? Gotta have this. It's great not having to rely on a browser, and all the resources they can eat up. It's pretty lightweight, cross-platform (Windows and Android - GET ON LINUX!), and is a pretty solid, if basic, player even without Amazon music."
Amazon,A store first - player as an afterthought,John Galt,22-Jan-14,2,"This used to be my main MP3 player on Android.  It was never great, but it worked.  Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player.  The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player.  You can't bypass this anymore.  There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet.  Uninstalled."
Amazon,The Best,mari espinosa,3-Jun-16,5,PERFECT ANY SONG I WANT IT'S THERE

Amazon,I liked the old version better,Ziggy,19-Oct-16,3,"I liked the old version better. This is like Groove on windows 10, but the response time is slower and interface is not as good."
Amazon,I switched from Rhapsody,Amazon Don,11-Jun-15,4,"Great features. There is a lot of options (prime, cloud, device) I switched from Rhapsody and a little disappointed in there free to add to library select for Prime members.

Amazon,Incredible Music Selection!,MsDee,25-Sep-15,4,"Very impressed with the selection and genres - how intuitive the app is at identifying songs based on what I like. The option to add to the cloud, a group I specify or download to my phone with unlimited skips amazed me!"
Amazon,Its ok...,P. Smith,24-Jul-15,2,It's ok if you are looking for something specific and they have the title. Would be nice to look for genre choices so I can hear something new or not discovered. I have Google music which is much better for music in my humble opinion..
Amazon,Five Stars,Chazcucci,23-May-17,5,Amazing selection!
Amazon,Outstanding Feature !!!,Harr M,18-Apr-15,5,A wonderful feature of Prime.  It alone is worth the Prime membership fee. I have already saved a bunch of money I would have spent on iTunes. Go for it.

Amazon,WILL NOT UPDATE,Drake H. Oglesby,29-Mar-16,1,"It is musically wonderful, but it's an almost useless app considering it will NOT update, & will NOT stop notifying me to update. Has crashed my HTC twice upon RE-downloading."
Amazon,NEEDS WORK,PAUL S,16-Jun-14,1,First the selection of artist and music is very limited unless you like Billy Joel or some of the other artist who show up everywhere.Second when i try to down load to my kindle fire it says it's not compatible. So for me 1 star

Amazon,Meh,Clint France,2-Mar-16,2,Kind of clunky menu. Wishing it was easier to navigate. I guess I'm comparing to Pandora more than anything. Be more like Pandora Amazon Music! I love not having commercials though.
Amazon,they arent my favorite band for nothing,Stephen Haas,7-Oct-15,5,"I always find with Chvrches that it take a few listens to really get into each song, but once I do and all the smaller details start to become apparent, well... they arent my favorite band for nothing! Awesome album!"

Amazon,works,NLWPS of Amherst,6-Jan-13,5,If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers.
Amazon,One Star,Rain,10-Nov-17,1,Wouldn't download. It just kept saying install pending.

Amazon,Doesn't work in landscape!,P.A.S.,17-Jun-14,2,"It's OK as an app - it does what it sets out to do, and I appreciate having some rather large albums in the cloud, rather than taking up space on my device, but:  the app only opens in portrait mode, and I usually use my tablet in landscape mode.  It's great to be able to listen to music while working, but it's super annoying when typing, editing spreadsheets, or doing other work (or even playing games!) to have everything in landscape EXCEPT for Amazon Music - I either have to turn my head sideways (not really comfortable) or turn the whole tablet/case/keyboard sideways (really inconvenient!)."
Amazon,I love the free prime music,Jason Schmidt,4-Sep-16,5,"I love the free prime music,  really makes my $ 100 a year more worthwhile.  If they started charging me I would really lower my rating."

Amazon,Bad update deleted all my playlists on device,Amazon Customer,31-Jul-14,1,"Lousy app.  Buggy, freezes, and now has deleted my playlists on my device.  I still have the songs, but have to rebuild playlists.  Can we even import playlists from Cloud to device?  Last I tried that was a no-go.  I'm a major Amazon fan, have Prime, and buy most everything through Amazon.  This app is lousy."
Amazon,Wow!,Amy,20-Jun-14,5,"What a perk to our already great Amazon Prime service. We have our music loaded and can play from our phones and computer. I love how almost every CD we have purchased has auto-tip, and is automatically loaded into our cloud player.We'll get hours of music enjoyment from this app. Thanks Amazon! You are the best."

Amazon,Best music option for phones and tablets,Ross V Ketchem,3-Dec-15,5,Best music option for phones and tablets. Upload your own music and playlists or select music and playlists and stations from thousands of artists. Just another great perk to being a Prime member.
Amazon,More Technology,Desert Wolverine,28-Mar-14,3,"It works but the sound quality coming from a phone isn't that great. I guess I would use music on my phone in the car if driving through an area where radio reception isn't so good. Seems easier to just turn on the car radio or play a CD. I know people listen to music on their phones wearing headphones while jogging, commuting etc."
Amazon,Get it.  Worth the perks of prime.,Thin blue line,20-Nov-15,4,"Only listened to a couple of albums and I have to say ""I'm impressed that it is packaged with Amazon prime.""  I don't have to wait for the songs I want to hear.  This is very important to me."
Amazon,Better than itunes!,Jananagins,16-Dec-14,5,I honestly don't know why anyone would go with itunes when this is available. I love this service. I use it instead of Pandora or itunes. It has a history of every single CD I have ever purchased in the history of buying from Amazon. It was automatically downloaded for free.
Amazon,Mac version of the Music Player is GARBAGE,Personal Robot,19-Oct-14,1,"The Mac version of Amazon Music Player is garbage, pure and simple. I can't speak for the Windows version, but the Mac version frequently (read: almost always) hangs for LONG periods of time before showing tracks in any section of the player. It also appears to use a lot of resources - I see system-wide issues while using Music Player, but when I completely close out of it, OS X goes back to behaving like it should. Now that we're forced to use this player to download any music we've added to Amazon Music, I've gone from merely irritated to absolutely angry. It is AWFUL software, and after several years dealing with quirks and outright problems with Amazon Music, I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this working correctly.Other ""fun"" issues:Badly matched songs (completely the wrong recordings - we're talking live songs being replaced by studio versions!) You can attempt to correct the match, but I have yet to get this to work well.MISSING songs! Inexplicably, some songs are just GONE from my library. Totally random - most albums are fine, others are missing this or that song, or maybe a couple. Infuriating.Tag editor destroys existing ID3 tags: if you dare edit any info in the file(s) you've uploaded, you will be rewarded with a downloadable version that has completely stripped out ALL tags. You won't know what song is what. ALL tags are empty, so there will be no artist to go by, no track name, no track number, no album name. NOTHING. This sounds completely unacceptable were it not for the need to rarely do this, but what makes it truly completely unacceptable is the fact that tracks in your library may randomly have their ID3 tags altered by either the uploader, whatever software runs on Amazon's servers, or the Music Player. And you're screwed at that point.Other than that, it's GREAT."

Amazon,I liked the idea of this app,Anastazia Hamilton,18-May-15,3,I liked the idea of this app....but something feels kinda unstable about it. It always crashes and suddenly closes when I try to use it on my Samsung Android phone. It is quite annoying to be listening to music and it suddenly stops mid song.

All my payment details are already saved on my account, aren't they?"
Amazon,Truely awful,Ciaoenrico,14-Jan-15,1,"The old Amazon MP3 always worked - and was usually my de facto music player on my phone. It was replaced with this slow, unweildy monstrosity that almost always crashes."

Amazon,"Good, not yet great.",Peter Harrison,9-Apr-15,4,"Make an option to exit the app. Put more selection into the Prime eligible music, there has to be a better way to search for music without having NOW and KIDZBOP being every other item on the list. Add more filters to make searching for music easier."
Amazon,update,Christopher Mayo,12-Apr-15,1,Amazon what did you do this new update is horrible. You took functions away and made it hard to navigate. If it's not broke don't fix it! I can't fast forward my music anymore and trying to find recent downloads is next to impossible. Plus the bugs.
Amazon,Good one!,Wanda S.,12-Oct-15,5,"Workd great. If I look my kindle battery or don't want to carry it along with the other 325 pounds of stuff in my purse.  Have a back-up, plus can play what I want to listen to while I'm driving.  Thank you!"

Amazon,Five Stars,brandon perini,26-Sep-15,5,such a great app
Amazon,Great but,jd,12-Dec-14,4,works great would like to figure out how to store music offline
Amazon,Meh... it's okay. Maybe I'm hoping for too much.,WeatherFiend,31-May-17,3,"It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."

Amazon,Very good if you have prime,Quinn hopman,16-Feb-16,4,"It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting."

Amazon,Easy to use,Jeff E,16-Jun-13,4,"The app is easy to use, both for Android and PC. My only gripe -- and it's less about the app than the songs that can't be saved to the cloud -- is that when I purchase a CD on Amazon, only some of the songs transfer to the cloud. In some cases, very few of the songs. I'm guessing this is a copyright issue, but it is disappointing nonetheless. If not for that, I'd give the app 5 stars."

Amazon,Is it trying to be Pandora or Spotify?,J. Worley,17-Jun-14,2,I don't think amazon knows yet.  Selection is weak.  Queuing up a play list is clunky and not intuitive.  Get back to me when you guys figure it out as I have Pandora and Spotify and don't have to pay $100/yr to get access.

I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I couldn't stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library. Didn't have to do a single thing but open up her back up and watch all the musical geniuses roll in. I give this app 10 stars out of 5. Way more than I expected for the money."

Amazon,"Good app, but needs on-device playlist backup",Daryl R. Gibson,13-Oct-11,5,"This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you  create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."

So I have my music on 2 devices plus my kiddo's tablet :0) I've got access set up for everyone to use. It's easy too use and making play list for all makes it easy for all too use. It's free so how could anyone say no? And, there is lots of great deals on music. :0) how do I put it on our laptop?? lol"
Amazon,Can't open,Stephen J Blake,14-Nov-14,1,"After repeated tries on my OnePlus One, Amazon Music always crashes when trying to open. It's a good thing I have Google All Access. I also cannot see this app in the Google Play Store anymore, which indicates that they could have dropped support for this phone. Disappointed."
Amazon,Good player when it works. Works well with Prime.,Obi Wan,10-Apr-15,4,"The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.The UI has gotten much better over the last year. It looks the same but it's much more responsive."

Now that I've been using it for awhile, I feel like a fool for not having used it before! Sure, not every artist is available to stream, but many hours of music are available. The ability to add songs to your library, make play lists and sort by artist, song or genre make this a very usable way to enjoy music. I still listen to Pandora and have found a lot of new music that way. But there is nothing like being able to punch up that perfect song for whatever mood your in, assuming of course it's available..."

But Amazon has invested so much, seems like they would invest in a more robust app for their music.

I wanted to pull them down from the cloud onto my phone but kept putting it off.  The app makes it too easy to keep procrastinating.

Amazon,What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ?,BLUESKYS4ME,12-Jun-14,5,"Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer.  My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"
Amazon,Love this app!!!,Brittany,13-Sep-15,5,"Easiest music application I've ever downloaded. You can download songs, albums or play stations with your favorite artists! I wish there was newer music in here but the choices available are really good!"
Amazon,Blegh.....,TG,8-May-15,1,Semi-clunky interface.  Realize that use of this app means being tied to your smartphone/similar.  Amazon doesn't want to become a Pandora and allow streaming through certain electronic equipment.  Until then I'll remain a non-user.

Amazon,Five Stars,M. Geiger,24-Jun-16,5,Love it.
Amazon,Great App!,Amazon Customer,28-Jan-14,4,I got this app because it allows me to import my music to my android for use with a ringtone converter. (I can't upload with USB because I can't find a compatible data cable.)  The bonus is that it plays my music loud enough to actually hear without headphones.  The only downside is that the free app is limited to only 250 songs.
Amazon,Has very bad stutter problem,R. Hanton,28-Mar-13,3,"I love to use this app on my Galaxy nexus, but it has a terrible problem of randomly stopping while playing music. I'm pretty sure it isn't some specific notification that stops the player, it's just random. Then you have to turn on your phone, unlock, and hit play manually to restart. Big problem, but otherwise great app."

Amazon,Nice!,SpinChin,17-Dec-14,5,"Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC.  I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.[On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]"

Amazon,A lot of hard work and it may function,Darin Warden,29-Mar-15,2,"This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn't. It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I've always installed from the play store, let's see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE,  LG G3,  that just might run amazon prime music, but it's just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
Amazon,Good music,Suzanne,16-Jun-16,5,Good music
Amazon,Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars ...,Nikky,8-Jun-15,4,Great app. The only reason I give 4 stars is because it won't transfer all of your music in your library. I cracked my screen on my phone and had to get a replacement... was disappointed when all of my music didn't transfer.

Amazon,"Interesting concepts, but fatally flawed.",Rick Q.,6-Dec-14,1,"I just wish the damned thing would work consistently. I thought it was purely a lack of support for the One Plus One, but it doesn't work correctly on either of my previous Nexus phones. My Library is hamstrung in an ecosystem that I can't take with me on the go."
Amazon,can't download to sd,Amazon Customer,7-Jan-15,1,"The Amazon prime music is great, I love the amount of free music available and the ability to download to device. Butwtf is the deal with not allowing downloaded data to be stored on external sd? Fills up device storage quickly! Amazon should be providing better service rather than trying to be like Apple."
Amazon,Bad music for me,Donald F. Bolles,17-Jun-14,1,"Loaded it on my android phone an removed ten minutes later.  Let me know when there are options available other than POP.  I even looked at the Latin selections, looked pretty miserable.Pandora has it right!"
Amazon,"great service, ok app",J. Sharp,29-Dec-14,3,"The interface is lacking, and the whole &#34;cloud or device&#34; thing is confusing. The navigation around the app shouldn't just default to albums. And it won't read any audio from an SD card, so if I put a bunch of music on a card it is invisible."

Amazon,Storage Management is Simply Terrible,Josh Trecartin,1-Mar-15,1,"It is difficult, sometimes impossible, to manage music files from the app. This makes downloading or deleting Prime Music impossible at moments. Your Prime Music is also saved to your internal storage with no option to put it on SD card which is a huge disadvantage if you have small internal storageGood luck trying to delete MP3s through the app as it will most likely remove the song from the app but keep the files on your device only to appear again in the app later. The experience with Prime Music would improve drastically if basic file management worked smoothly."
Amazon,Five Stars,Carlene M Bravo,18-Jun-16,5,Love it!
Amazon,Awesome music!,Michele Roberts,23-Oct-16,5,Once you tell it what you like and what you don't it's fantastic. I practically never have to skip a song.
Amazon,Could be much better. I expect more of Amazon. UI anyone?,J Hodges,13-Sep-14,2,"The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."

Amazon,This app is great on mobile,Amazon Customer,21-Aug-15,3,"This app is great on mobile, but on a computer? Terrible. Terrible enough for me to knock off two stars without hesitation. It won't sync properly and completely ignores music that I've bought in the past."
Amazon,Limited,imawareru,16-Jun-14,3,"I tried to find some of my favorite bands. Just like Prime for movies, everything I want costs more $$$. The free stuff doesn't cut it. I'm sticking with free Pandora for now until Amazon expands its collection."

Wow, now maybe FB can start charging me to post messages too."
Amazon,What's not to like about it?,Schups,18-Jul-16,5,"This is an added bonus with a Prime membership, and as such, it's great!The selection is a little limited compared to other music streaming services, but that's not a problem for me.They've added new features like radio stations and curated playlists, so I find myself using this app and the web player quite frequently.The mobile app allows to download songs and playlists for offline listening, so that's a great feature. Though the downloaded songs will not be detected by other media player apps on the device.It's not pushy in trying to make me buy more music. There are no ads.I did not find this app for my smart TV and Blu-ray player, so that was disappointing. But some media players like Roku support it, so you could use your home theater to listen to Amazon Music."

They had music I haven't heard in 20+ years its awesome one of the many reasons I renewed my subscription to Prime.

Listen to me take the time to check the whole "" Prime offer "" out before you decline. I wasn't going to buy into the Amazon prime thing at all but as I was against the wall and x-mas was only 2 weeks away ""Free shipping & I got a free 30 day trial membership no strings attached "" when the dust settled & it was over I had the time to use prime I loved it and I will say this use the 30 day trail free with all the benefits free shipping free movies, games plus ""Alexa "" you and your family will wonder how & why you didn't sign up sooner.Enjoy _Ù÷_"

Started the same station on a different day and it started with same song as before.  Pandora seems to be a much more robust service.  Wish it was better as I like taking advantage of Amazon Prime services and could see benefits of being connected to Amazon shopping."
Amazon,Love it!,Melissa,22-Oct-15,5,"Love how the prime playlists are set up already . One playlist called  ""Just Beats"" is my favorite, it has lots of music with no lyrics and just smooth beats ! I love it the app."
Amazon,How do you not love free music!!!,Kathryn Scriven,20-Feb-15,5,"With Amazon Prime membership you can download music for free.

I've bought music from Amazon since they sold only cds... But...this app just stinks. The sound isn't as good as other apps,  it doesn't read my other playlists and it got corrupted somehow on my phone. After deleting it and reinstalling this app about 15 times,  it finally worked as it used to.. Without my amazon prime music playlists. Badly done,  Amazon. Please put some work and pride into your music app!!!"

Amazon,far behind,Michael,31-Oct-14,1,Doesn't come close to the selection convenience or ease of use of an of the other major music subscription services. I was hoping this would push me to resubscribe to prime. But my Netflix and Beats subscription have everything I want from prime and do it better.
Amazon,I love Amazon MP3!,britewindow,28-Oct-12,5,"Amazon MP3 was the answer to the problem of finding novelty tunes, sound effects, movie themes and science fiction music.  I fondly remembered all the novelty tunes of the 1970's which were played regularly on the radio.  But how to listen again?  I certainly don't want entire albums in some cases.  So I picked out the ones I like from Amazon MP3, and viola - back to the fun times.  Thank you , Amazon MP3."

Amazon,Don't get this app,Robert L. Simmons,25-Jun-14,1,Maybe it's just me but I don't see how this app does anything but play songs that you already had on your phone and sell new songs to you.  I can't find where it streams anything like Pandora or Rhapsody or iTunes.  What's the big deal?  Why should I use this over the apps I already have?

Amazon,"Great feature adds to what already made prime worth it, warning use on wifi only. That data cap will get ya",James Yuenger,14-Dec-14,5,"When you have wifi Its my favorite music app, and just another perk that makes amazon prime great. Seriously hated paying up front but I love it now, pay once get it over with. And use the monthly payment you would have made to save for next year, you will renew. This feature along with all the others makes it worth it. The amount I have saved on shipping alone pays for it. I live in rural northern Minnesota free 2 day, yup and thanks for every other feature. Please dont raise the price again though, I'm still poor :( but the music app is really clean, and does everything pandora does and more. Plus nothing better than test driving a new album, I still usually buy the ones I like. Good art deserves to get paid. Except the drummer from Metallica, I don't even download music and I hate him. Let the new guys bitch, you had 30 years prior to make a living."
Amazon,Best app on the market,Russ Rodgers,6-Dec-15,5,Best music app on the market. I can listen to many good Christian songs and even download them on my phone through Wi-Fi to listen to later so I do not have to use my data.
Amazon,Great!,Amazon Customer,26-Jun-14,4,"I like it a lot! Has a lot of popular music (I mostly listen to country music so that's what this is based on) and even songs that weren't popular, but that I like. It didn't have a few of the artists that I searched for and that's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Otherwise, I love it!"

Amazon,Pointless app,Jesse C.,24-Nov-14,1,"I had to download this app just so I could download ONE SONG to my music player. I don't think I'll be buying music from Amazon again. Amazon rocks for everything I purchase though. And yes, I did uninstall Amazon music shortly after the song downloaded."

My opinion has greatly improved since upgrading, but there is still a ballroom left for improvement...THE GOOD:*Prime Music - ""Free"" with Prime, I didn't have that feature when I subscribed, so it's a plus. I've found around 10 albums on Prime that I didn't already have, so I can listen for ""Free"" and see if I want to buy them permanently.*I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone.*Download for listening offline is great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without using data, perfect! Better than Pandora. This IS about the only positive point of the actual App...THE BAD:*Downloading/finding my purchased Amazon music is much harder than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music, but I don't see a way to do that.*Storage of offline listening music can't be moved, no option for it...*Doesn't resume play once app is shut down. This makes it a terrible music player. I don't really want the app running all the time, but that means I need to remember where I left off... This alone is worth 1 star.*I don't seem to be able to hide anything from it... I listen to one type of music, but I need to purchase other music here and there. I don't want that cluttering things up, but I am astounded at the lack of options in this app...You can do better Amazon..."

Amazon,Good App,Daniel,17-Jan-14,3,Love the fact that all my music is easy to find and play through this app as well as the equalizer feature.

There was a wide selection of music that I could stream integrated with my own music library,  but after a few days it started to become glitchy. When I opened another music player, suddenly I couldn't see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and  listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions.

I can't imagine not being an Amazon prime member Music, Movies, Books and free shipping on the things I buy what more could I want? Thank you Amazon!"
Amazon,A great app with one major drawback.,kyle,27-Jul-14,4,"This is a great app for taking advantage of the 'Prime Music' benefit. The user interface is nice and intuitive, and accessing music is pretty easy. If you are searching for music and something is not prime eligible, then asks whether you want to purchase it. So no 1-click accidental purchases.The biggest drawback is that you cannot control where the app stores the downloaded files. This is a problem because it saves the downloads on the internal memory which has very limited room. If it weren't for this I would rate this app 5 stars."

My breakdown after 1 day or so looking at it:I found it difficult to navigate the app, particularly with respect to what is included as Prime Streaming and what is not.  More specifically, it's frustrating that the ""Prime"" (i.e., no additional cost) music is sort of mixed in with all the stuff that is for purchase.With Google Play Music, it takes some effort to actually go and purchase something.  Basically what you find in Google Play Music streaming is available to you for unlimited streaming and included in your subscription cost.With this service, I'm wary that I might click on something and end up buying it.  Maybe that is the point, really.Amazon needs to clearly separate the ""free"" (i.e.included in Prime subscription) streaming music from the rest for this app to be very useful."

Amazon,So far so good,John R.,20-Jun-14,5,"This is a nice enhancement to the ""Prime"" package. Already loaded up my phone with tunes that I don't have in my collection already. I hope Amazon keeps adding features like this to the Prime membership. I wonder if they will ever add Audio Books to it? <-hint*"
Amazon,Easy to use,Dave Borowski,21-Mar-16,5,Had no problems at all and it was simple.  It didn't take long at all to install.  I kept my music on track with my computer so It worked great.

Amazon,another great app,cherylnjerry,6-May-15,5,this is one of the perks that come with prime membership. I must say there is more music than I can listen too. There are also meditation and hypnosis apps as well. Theres something for everyone. I love it!
Amazon,Thanks but...,Garcia,18-Jun-14,2,No thanks.  You're selection isn't there yet.  My favorites are Tool and Radiohead which are not available. I'll keep it in hopes you get better artists like The Beatles or Pink Floyd and please don't try and cram bad music down my throat such as Christian or County or pop
Amazon,Playlists are lacking,Blackberry,2-Jul-14,4,"The iPhone app is very functional (although the ""sign up"" process was a little confusing).  The amount of prime music available is impressive but the length, variety and number of the preset playlists are lacking.  Still a great addition to the prime membership."

Amazon,Incompatible,T. Kindig,20-Jun-14,2,"Maybe the app is good, maybe it isn't--Amazon Prime Music isn't designed to be compatible with my older Android device and Spotify is, so that makes for an easy decision. If you're interested in subscribing to Prime based on the music service, be sure to check your specs."

Amazon,Disappointing upgrade...,Amazon Customer,29-Oct-16,1,"I never thought I'd ever need to give such a negative review to anything Amazon sells much less one of their products but this latest ""upgrade"" of Amazon Music has been a major disappointment to this user/ customer. My major complaint is the inability to upload songs from my laptop to Amazon Music. I've tried numerous times and all I get is the screen with the new logo on it and nothing else. The screen just stares back at me mockingly smirking."

Amazon,Love it 99% of the time.,Oscar,14-Jun-13,5,It is nice to buy music and have it available and any device that you have (thanks to amazon cloud) with internet connection.

Merge it to the album name.5) Lacks support to upload folders instead of filesLuxury1) Add an equalizer2) Add share feature to share via facebook/twitter.3) iPhone, iPad app :)"

Amazon,Amazon Music App thumbs down.,Amazon Shopper,31-Dec-14,1,"Down loaded the app and found out it uses a lot of memory about the same amount as the whole Operating System on the phone. Didn't like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it didn't need to access. Didn't like that at all as it's giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I don't want to give away. Then found out I couldn't delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I don't need to give you and you don't need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app isn't very intuitive to use. I won't be reloading it, and would suggest avoiding it, as it's a memory hog and bloats your data rate needlessly."

It makes it so easy to exercise or walk with, and yet I can relax and read to the music also.  The different groups, such as amazon music for walking, update constantly, and I do not have to go to the web site to do it.  Makes listening to the music fantastic. My only problem with this is that I can access movies while travelling outside of the US, but not the music,  You have to download it.  Hurry up and get the musical access also!"

Amazon,"VERY basic, No user controls, Poor documentation.",A. Tubesing,25-Mar-11,3,"*** It should be noted that I wrote this review before Amazon converted this app to the ""cloud player"" so even though this app has the same name as the current one, there may be significant changes in how it works now. ***You can search, listen to samples, and buy songs with this app. However, there are no user controllable settings and it gives VERY little information about the song or the album while shopping. You also must sync this to your amazon shopping account and enable one-click purchases to make it work.This is a very basic app, which is a good thing to some degree... that's what keeps it simple. I'm glad it's not trying to be everything under one roof. I don't want it to be a music player and do all sorts of other annoying stuff like iTunes does. However, it is so limited that it's hard to feel like it's easy to use because the limitations require other work-arounds.~~~Shopping Experience:~~~When shopping for songs or albums, there's no description, reviews, or anything else other than the artist, title, and a date (which is not explained--is that the release date or what?).Being able to listen to song samples so easily is a very nice feature. It's quite easy to search for a song, quickly find it, and listen to a sample before buying. It's great if you're not sure what song you're looking for.There are some strange things about it though. For example, several songs and albums I searched for have two versions of the same song for two different prices. Songs from the same name, artist, and album sometimes show up as two separate listings for $.99 and $.89 with no explanation of the difference. Are they different bit rates or something? Different formats? With no explanation available and no extra detail about the song... who knows what you're getting.There seems to be no way to put songs in a cart and buy them all in a single purchase. You must activate one-click on your amazon account to use this app. I just started using it so I haven't seen the credit card bill yet, but the way this works makes it seem as though there's going to be a separate $.99 charge on the card for every individual song you buy. This seems a little tedious. I would love to buy several songs at once in a single transaction.It would also be nice to buy up a credit balance for the phone like a gift card so I could just purchase songs as I discover them and have the cost deducted from my  balance without paying for each separately. I don't want to have to share that with my other amazon web shopping however, so I'm not sure if a traditional Amazon gift card would work. It's all pretty poorly explained. If I were going to use this app a lot I would be tempted to create a new amazon account specifically for this app so I wouldn't have to commingle settings with my web shopping.Also, there seems to be no way to retrieve previously-purchased songs later on if they get lost or deleted. It would be really nice if it would put the song in a queue to download next time you sign in from your computer so you can easily use it there too. Currently I copy them from my phone to the computer... so why not just buy them on the computer and copy them to the phone? That's not any harder or easier so it contributes to my point that while the app is easy in itself, it requires a bunch of extra work to get the full value out of your music purchase thereby negating the so-called convenience of the apps simplicity.~~~App Experience:~~~Because there are no user controls, you can't specify what folder the songs get put into or where it is located. Neither of the music players on my phone are able to find the amazon mp3 folder on their own (even after refreshing the media list) and therefore are unable to show and play the new music. So I had to install a file manager app, and each time I buy a song I have to copy the it to my normal music folder.Finally, the documentation for this app sucks. Actually working the app itself is pretty easy and self-explanatory (mostly because it has no features other than searching for songs and pressing the buy button), but it requires a whole bunch of coordination with your amazon account and its settings and the implications of all the little things you do are not at all evident. Everything is very poorly explained, if at all. You have to fumble through all the steps until you figure things out on your own. Then for the few topics they offer help with, it's takes you to a web page for an explanation... but comically, it's not a mobile-friendly web page so you have to zoom in and scroll left and right to read the lines. Seriously? These are web pages written specifically relating to a mobile phone app, ostensibly to be read primarily on a mobile phone, yet they're not in a mobile friendly format. Big fail.~~Summary:~~~As powerful a site as amazon.com is, I'm a little surprised at how incredibly basic this app is. The way it works now, I find it much easier to just buy the songs from the amazon web site with a computer, and transfer them to the phone manually. The only time I envision using this app is when I'm away from my computer and desperately want a song right away."

Amazon,POOR MUSIC APP,John S.,4-Apr-16,1,"I give this app a -10 (minus 10). It crashes constantly. I can be surfing the Web on my phone or checking my email without listening to music and it crashes interrupting what I'm doing. Tech support says uninstall the app. But when I do this it deletes all the music I downloaded. Then it takes time to redownload my  music(have over 3500 songs) mainly full CD's. And not having internet at home this causes problems. Last time I did this it hijacked over 500 songs from another music from my other music player along with duplicating 300 of them(over 800 additional on my SD card). So I  hesitate to uninstall it again for fear of losing my songs from the other music player. In addition I  now have I have several CD'so that I purcased from Amazon that are now on my other music player. When it crashes if I don't select report the crash the music still plays, however I can't see what's playing. I have a Samsung S4 with 16GB internal  and a 64GB SD card. Found the best work around is to force a stop on the app and delete cache, restart the phone then try again to play music.Is this anyway to listen to your music? DON'T THINK SO!!!! Wish they could get their act together!!!!"

Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61).  I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point.

And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

Amazon,Doesn't work,Reel Duel,20-Jun-14,1,It is supposed to be Android compatible but it doesn't work on my phone. I'll admit I have an older phone 2-3 year old HTC Thunderbolt running Cyanogenmod 7.1.1 and it loaded Amazon MP3 player instead. So I cannot use this app at all.
Amazon,Where is the Fire TV version of the app???,Gannicus88,9-Jul-14,3,"I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums."

I start it again, get my band picked (on Prime, or my library) shuts down again.Since I've had the app, I spent a lot of time setting my playlists. Then you update and bam, playlists are empty. I've done that multiple times. If you all don't do something I'm going to migrate to a different company. I don't want to, but as another reviewer said, you have to try hard to make an app this bad."

The app has been updated, so it runs pretty smoothly in Android. It has a decent quality in streaming, but I recommend downloading and playing offline your favorite music. The audio quality will be top!The desktop app is basically Spotify with an Amazon skin. So, you know what to expect.Unfortunately, my cars don't have a link to this app, so I only have basic controls over Bluetooth - which is not bad at least, but not perfect. However, nothing that makes me stop using it.If you're Prime, this is a must use!"

Prime members should take advantage of the free music streaming that Amazon provides! I haven't yet streamed music with the Amazon Music app without wifi yet, but so far it has been relatively smooth and the audio is high quality.The only downside is that it seems you would have to choose another playlist once the current one is finished, or else the music just stops. It is only a drawback because I like to listen to music for long periods of time and it is a bit bothersome to constantly pick another playlist once one is over."

Now with no download status it's just blind guessing.Additionally, I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again.

I get error messages constantly, I can't download items or delete items with the app freezing and its even screwing up the album cover thumbnail with the artist (putting a Beatles album cover with a Rolling Stones album for example). Often it takes a bunch of random songs and throws them together in an ""unknown  artist"" album. What?

I recently attempted to upload some music and it showed that it completed the upload, but failed as it uploaded 20% of the music I needed to upload and did not upload the rest.  For the past year and a half, it's been a real pain to upload music.  I wish I could get a refund for the services as it barely work anytime that I need it.

Amazon,It's alright.  A nice added bonus to Prime members.  But...,Rendiggity,16-Jun-14,3,"Don't expect it to be like Spotify, Slacker or Pandora.  Maybe I haven't the found the feature, but it doesn't seem like this will play songs based on something you're currently listening to.  There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own.  But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs.  I don't know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above.  I would have been a great feature, and I'd give it four or five stars then."

Amazon,They broke the shuffle feature,Robert B. Thompson,17-Jun-16,2,"Under normal circumstances this app deserves a good solid 4 stars. With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs."

Amazon,Excellent.  A great way to keep your treasured music close.,Andre Lawrence,18-Dec-12,4,"Amazon gives you 5 GB of space but they have lowered the space for your music.  The good thing is that because if you have a mobile device or a tablet, this gives you access to the collection that you can't do without.  And, it's free.  Just wished that Amazon upgraded it to have some kind of built-in EQ/Amp."

Amazon,Prime music is good lots of variety. I hope the artists get some money!,L. Carp,21-Apr-16,5,love to listen to various playlists and a variety of curated channels.
Amazon,"Amazon Cloud is great, but Android app has some killer limitations",Roger the Lion Hearted,17-Dec-13,2,"I pay $25 a year to be able to store all my music in the Amazon cloud, and I'm very happy to be able to listen to my music at home, at work, or, with this app, anyplace I've got a 4G or Wi-Fi signal.So far, so good.But, there are horrible limitations with this app that Amazon could easily fix, if they wanted to:1) It won't download music to your SD cardI bought a 64GB SD card so I could listen to my music when I didn't have a connection (and also so I wouldn't have to worry about using too much data).But when it downloads music it goes to your phone's internal memory, and can't be set to use an SD card. Why? Why? Why? My Galaxy Note II has just 16GB of internal memory, which is needed for programs, etc. There is not much space to store a bunch of music. That's why I bought the SD card (from Amazon!). Google Music let's you download to SD - you can too!2) It will let you download your music, but still streams it from the cloudI was enjoying listening to my music from the Amazon cloud so much that I was pushing against my Verizon data limits. No problem, I thought, I'll just use the handy download function in the app. So, before a big car trip I created a playlist and clicked the download button. On the drive I pulled up the playlist and started to play it. Everything seemed great until I lost the 4G signal and the music stopped. What happened? Hadn't I downloaded the songs? Well, yes, the songs had downloaded to my phone, but the stupid Amazon MP3 player was still streaming the songs over the Internet, even though it ""knew"" that it had already downloaded them all. Stupid!3) No gapless playback.Try listening to Dark Side of the Moon or Abbey Road with gaps between all the songs and it just ruins the experience."
Amazon,Love it!,Mom of Boy & Girl,29-Jan-16,5,Love all the free prime music! Great for when I go on runs to have my music right there!
Amazon,Five Stars,Kevin Short,16-Sep-16,5,"Excellent service, excellent choices"
Amazon,Music must have app,Soccer Mom,19-Aug-16,5,"I needed music for a party for my coworkers retirement. They put me in charge of getting music and I was easily able to find it here on Amazon. That in itself is a blessing. Once I purchased the music I needed, I needed to download this app in order to play it. Normally this would suck and I would hate it but it's made everything so much easier. So I downloaded this app and it has the music that I have purchased right there. I can download the music on my phone so that when I am in the party, it's not using my data in order to play it. It can just play from my phone. I like that part. I have downloaded the music that I purchased and created an album to play my music through for the party so it's easily accessible and ready for use. It also adds my songs that I currently have on  my phone so I don't have to manually switch those over. Overall this is a great app, especially if you have prime. There are a lot of songs that you can get for free because of prime."
Amazon,Love It!,yezz07,29-Oct-11,4,"The only reason I got this application was because I wanted to buy ONE mp3 album through Amazon mobile. But after browsing the selection I end up downloading FIVE  mp3 albums. This was surprising because I still preferred buying hardcopy  CDs.  Amazon has a good selection of music, smooth browsing, music cloud, option to download to phone and competitive pricing."

With or without letting me know. Sometimes, it'll tell me there's a problem try again, and other times it'll just stop and we'll stop. No warning. But other than that, I love that I can listen to full albums without interruptions though. I also love that I can search through Amazon prime to find more music as well while listening to music still. It shows whats available on amazon prime. Love that. A few fixes and then this would be a great app and would get 5 stars."

I recently heard a song that triggered so much memories for me I was thinking of going to buy the whole album again. Luckily, the song and the whole album was available on Prime Music (whereas it was not available in the other music streaming services). I was able to download into my phone, and down memory lane we went! What's nice is that the whole album is still available off line after downloading the songs! Highly recommend this service!"

Amazon,Good content delivery system that needs a better UI,King,29-Mar-16,3,"Performance-wise, the app delivers music with good speed and quality, and the prime music selection is pretty solid. The user interface has a tendency to feel clunky and at times counter-intuitive. Search algorithm should be better optimized.  As-is, the system often just displays all the covers available through prime music without mentioning the original artist. This leaves the user wondering if the search went wrong. When someone searches for a song, it should display the original artist first, with track availability (unavailable, purchase-only, or PRIME). It would be nice to see how popular the covers are too as part of the search result."

Amazon,Perfect fit for any music lover.,Robken Lingan,31-Dec-15,5,"Love the music library, easy to search, and just a ton of music from different genres."
Amazon,Unfinished Product,Biff Webster,1-Feb-16,3,"There is no music history, or way to customize the existing radio stations other than rating the song currently playing.  I accidentally thumbed down a song I really liked, and now will never hear it again since there's no way to undo this action.  Good design based on HCI principles should not allow for permanent consequences from simple user error.  It's also not well documented whether rating a song affects all stations, or only the current station - for instance, I may not want to hear Philadelphia on my Classic Rock station between The Who and Hendrix, but I may have a Rock Ballads station that it would be perfectly acceptable on.  Rating the song on one station shouldn't affect the other.  If this behavior was better documented, and a simple rating history feature was implemented, Prime Music could replace my Pandora One subscription since I'm already an Amazon Prime member. #AnthonyNaddeo - get busy and fix this for me."

Amazon,Amazon music app is abysmal and should be avoided at all cost,Brian Mumphrey,25-Apr-17,1,"This app is by far the biggest piece of junk and it keeps getting worse.  It CONSTANTLY syncs the cloud library which seems to slow down the device way too often.  Buying individual songs vs buying whole albums causes issues when adding the music to your device, the streaming is really a joke and always cuts out if a stiff breeze comes along.  All in all this app is a waste of time unless you download the music to a personal library and play it from an app made by people who know what their doing. I bought 4 songs off an album, for some reason it didn't add them to my phone.  I tried then buying the full album to see if that would work and it downloaded all the songs but the first 4 I bought. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the songs to my computer and then transfer them, nope, apparently there is a problem with my download and all I am able to do is submit a ticket. Seriously amazon, I expect more."
Amazon,Five Stars,Mark,14-Sep-16,5,Love it. Just what I needed.
Amazon,Nice addition to music purchase.,Glenn M. Chapoton,7-Jul-13,3,"It is adequate, no  guide to tell you how to navigate through it.Works well with downloaded music from Amazon.Being able to purchase hard copy of CD and have MP3 instantly for the same price (or lower !) makes I-Tunesfar less superior!"

Amazon,Not a fan,Belaleah,16-Jan-16,2,"App doesn't work on my Android (Samsung Note).  It had worked fine for quite some time and then one day stopped working properly.  I went through Amazon ""tech support,"" which was a joke.  The tech told me the problem was that I didn't have the latest version.  It was a real hassle to download the latest version because I first had to download some Amazon App which is equivalent to a play store.  The tech informed me that if I downloaded it elsewhere (like from other play stores or even the Amazon site) it wouldn't be the latest version. In the end it still didn't work, so the tech did some more checking and then told me they were having issues with Samsung devices but were working on it.  Very frustrating and a big waste of time.  Amazon Music works fine on my iPhone and, of course, through my Fire TV, but the music is very limited if you're not into pop stuff.  This made the whole experience even worse because it wasn't worth my time.  Amazon really needs to get it together if they expect to compete with Pandora and Spotify.  ."

Amazon,This is a great app.,Ronald Lovewell,19-Jun-14,5,I gave it 5 stars because prior to this I could not listen to my ITunes library on my android tablet.  After uploading I now have access to my entire library with the added bonus of Prime Music.
Amazon,So is anyone besides me upset? nay - mad?,Cynthia Raxter,25-Sep-12,1,"So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)After a month I was all done.Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!Yes. I am just that mad."

If there is an album of theirs that you want to buy then buy it you are still supporting your favorite band or artist.  Not everything can be for free."

Since others are having this same issue, I am concerned that Amazon may have lost site of the need to play songs that I buy from them.  I have sent many reports from the error screen.  I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted..you name it and I have done it.  The install itself seems very glitch and not smooth like prior versions.  All of this has been going on for a month."

Amazon,not what I was hoping for.,Corey Roman,14-Oct-14,2,"I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."

Amazon,"Zero morality settings, ZIP",Phreud,17-Aug-16,1,"This app has a LONG way to go.  But it's all you can use with Prime music.  Searching for music comes up with lame knock-off remixes, and bands instead of the original artists.  That is SO LAME. Also, there is NO EASY WAY to setup preferences to NEVER EVER find and/or playback explicit lyrics!  Completely hazardous to family values.  I would say that most people do NOT want to hear music that sings F_CK and B_ITCHES and MOTHERF_CKER all the time.  Do NOT listen to ""RnB"" music on Amazon unless you like hearing the F word 1000 times per work day."

Amazon,Great Streaming Experience,SoCal Nana,14-Jul-16,4,"Lately, I've been listening to my Prime Music collection almost every night.  I would give it five stars, except that there are some artists and songs that are slow to make it to the collection.  Some of my old favorites from the 70's / 80's / 90's were in my original collection, but then were pulled out (i.e., Neil Young) and not available for ""free"" (I pay for Amazon Prime, so it's not exactly free).Just figured out how to download songs from my playlist to my cell phone to play offline.  This will come in handy to play in the car, since my radio is on the fritz.  Must have tunes when driving!  I just bought a holder for the phone so that I will be able to hear the music and advance through the selections hands free.Streaming quality is great.  I like the suggestions for other songs I might like.  Could use more indie selections."

Amazon,Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the ...,Ben Arthofer,1-Dec-14,5,"I was skeptical at first, but after a phone call to customer support they helped answer my questions.#1 I thought I made a mistake when I downloaded my first 10 albums to my phone thinking I had spent 150 accidentally on music... This is what I learned.Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the cloud or saved to your device for free. I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory, but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access.The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was. I have 178 songs so far and only spent about 5 dollars purchasing some songs that weren't prime approved.In response to my #1 experience I ended up paying .99 for the one song that was not prime out of the albums."

Amazon,Amazon Music has lost its way,Jim Garland,31-Oct-14,1,"Ive been useing Amazon MP3 for years and have used it as my primary music player for four diffent phones ive used since the iPhone 3. The iPhone 3s 64gig is where I downloaded it first. Loved it on the HTC Sence and kinda miss it. Then I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 3 which was also wonderful and easily integrated with the device.I now use a LG smartphone. Interestingly when I set up my new phone I logged into my google account and my ohine automatically downloaded all the apps I had previously installed... except Amazon MP3. It was just gone.Today I went to install the new Music app and stopped short at the privacy screen. Good g-d!I went back and read some reviews and it looks like I am not alone as far as being disappointed.DRM free music and general un censored control of my music is what wone me over back in 2007/2008Removing the option to save music and cover art to my external sd card is a huge deal. I want control.I accidentally figured out how to install the darn app only after accidentally figuring out how to install the prime video player extension to the Amazon app.It too damn hard to find for me and im somewhat savvy. Someone over there (maybe even sevral) needs to get there head out of there own doggy dish and render this app useable again.Relax the permissions and security it's just too much. I had to override my phones security to allow untrusted apps to have near full control of all my data. I call bulshit.Pandora had become redundant and boring.  Sootify crashes my browser and is unreliable iheart radio and last fm were also not good enough for me to change my routine. And now Amazon MP3 has gone all prism on me... sad.After 5 blissful years I want a divorce. Unfortunately for you I'm keeping the kids and their allowance. The whole family is now addicted to Google Play Music where we can search nearly artist song or radio stream and be listening in seconds. Its also much easier to purchase music and movies via the play store as well.Sometimes Amazon just needs get out of their own way, and take my money."

Amazon,Love It,Kindred Kel,14-Mar-12,5,"I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, ""which device is that song on?""!I LOVE IT!"

Amazon,"Wanted to love this, I really did",raccemup,8-Nov-16,2,"Wanted to love this, I really did. I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can't get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it's a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it's the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and looking elsewhere. It's a real shame they can't make this product work correctly."

Amazon,Prime Music,Madge,31-Aug-15,4,Amazon Prime has most of my favorite songs.
Amazon,A perfectly decent solution,Adam J. Rendall,14-Jan-13,3,"Do you have a phone on which you listen to music? Do you buy music from Amazon? Then you need to get this.  It's a well designed program for getting your Amazon Music purchases to your phone.  And the player is...acceptable.  It plays music, and doesn't glitch up trying to do it.However, the more you use the player, the more you'll find it's not all you want.  You'll listen to an album, and then it'll just stop; it won't keep playing to the next album in your library. The interface is straight forward, but just slightly off somehow. You'll want to do one thing, and you'll accidentally do another.  You'll never have a MAJOR problem with the media player, but it's not the perfect answer.If you want something with tons of options and personalization, look elsewhere for your music app.  If you're looking for a way to get your Amazon purchases to your phone, and a perfectly acceptable player for those songs, stop right here."

Amazon,Bad example of bad,Rebecca Lynne Gallerzzo,12-Nov-16,1,"Have used my prime membership to download on my kindle for 2 years with no problem. But this app will not honor my prime membership nor will it access my cloud library without a paid membership. Imrove it and I'll improve my review. Otherwise, it's off my phone as wasted space."

Amazon,Convinced me to never buy another MP3 from Amazon ever again,Matthew Miller,8-Mar-13,1,"The app insists on keeping any downloaded files on internal memory and not on the SD card. There's no configuration option for changing the library location.While the application has settings that claim to limit downloads to Wi-Fi only, and to not automatically download new purchases, my experience has been that the application does NOT respect these settings. I learned this when I found my phone downloading a Handel box set I'd purchased, eating up the remaining internal memory on my phone and using my T-Mobile data plan to do it. If I wasn't paying for unlimited data this bug would have cost me a few hundred megs in overage charges. I tried pausing the active download, but the application kept chugging along, giving me no way to STOP the downloads.The application can't be trusted to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveals Amazon has no apparent plans to fix these problems.  If you install it, be sure to have an unlimited data plan, or you WILL eventually get hit with a large data overage charge from your mobile carrier.I'm going to try and find a resolution for these bugs, but if I can't find one I'm uninstalling the application."

Amazon,FIX THIS NOW!!!,Trazz,12-Jan-17,1,"For over a month now, ""Amazon Music"" has a bug where the New Releases section in the ""Store"" - Not Prime...  only shows music from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, etc..  I can't see what's new and listen to previews of new music before purchasing, because nothing from this side of the globe is even on there!This needs to be fixed.  No wonder so many people get their music for free via Torrents, when our choices to PURCHASE and control our own music libraries are piss poor. Greed in the streaming only game is pathetic, and you can only push people so far.FIX THIS BUG!"

I cant say how well selection is 4ea but looks like in general theres a ok 2good amt free, including recent releases. Theres also PRIME playlists U can stream or download w/categories from ""rock"" or ""rap"" yr workouts & classical 4reading, soothe baby, etc.1st music app I've had was iTunes so incomparison w/buying everything 4stars.. ITunes does have quite the selection so -1 4that! 2nd app I've used &most recent was Google play so, I'm probly biased but I liked format, listing top songs, related artists, which amazon sorta does &artist mini bio which amazon doesn't. Plus Google play $9.99mo unlimited, so I was inclined 2stay but as Prime member thought I'd check it out. Prime perks R 5star, where else is it free despite limited selection.

Amazon,WHY IS THE RESPONSE TIME ON THE ECHO APP SO MUCH FASTER?,DiscConnected,4-Jun-15,3,"I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library(134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years).I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist (even with a name like Todd Rundgren) the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."
Amazon,Great,PhillyintheKeys,3-Nov-13,5,Easy to access and manage music library this is coming from a non technically savvy guy. I am using this site to manage my play lists as a spin instructor.

And you don't find out until after you download it.

Amazon,Just the player I need!!!,George L.,23-May-13,5,"The ability to stream music from the cloud or simply download on my device to listen without WiFi access is all I wanted from this app, and it works well."
Amazon,Like others have said,Amazon Customer,3-Nov-14,1,"Like others have said, I too consider this the absolute worst application I have ever used.  Why, Amazon, have you made this so difficult?  I have spent 25 years in IT, and believe me when I say, this is the most frustrating and non-intuitive application I have ever used.  The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!!  Really??  In this day and age??  Did you not test this before dumping this on us??  I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just don't have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software."
Amazon,Great App,BMO8135,23-Apr-13,5,This seemlessly links your amazon music. It allows you to download or play songs from the cloud. I have never had any issues with performance.

Amazon,"Zero stars -useless for mobile purposes, purchases still go to internal memory, deleted all play lists on my device.",K2ofCU,18-Jun-14,1,"The layout is not  user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion).You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.).Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)-  it STILL loads it to the internal memory.  (!!!)My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.(This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.(I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I'm at home, fine.  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy)."

I listen with headphones on my laptop.  I use it on my larger PC system when I'm working.  I download favorite artists to my phone, then listen later via bluetooth on my car stereo (no data overage!).  I use it on my Echo for light music at dinner time."

Amazon,Great music but...,scott1214,18-Nov-16,1,"Ever since Amazon Unlimited was revealed the app got worse. Now all my purchased music is screwed up and mislabeled. An entire Matt Hires album now says every song is titled Glorious by David Archuleta, several of my George Strait songs are titled The Pretender by The Foo Fighters, and a Steve Moakler album is How Far We've Come by Rob Thomas. Now mind you these are all songs I purchased on amazon. I don't even know what other songs I can't enjoy because they've been mislabeled and I can't find them. Please fix this Amazon so I can enjoy my music!"

Amazon,HATE this app,Amazon Customer,13-Feb-13,1,"HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon."

Amazon,Impressed!,Jimme,9-Jun-16,5,"Prime music impressed a friend and myself while listening to one of the playlists. We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists."

Amazon,"Great, if it works.",vandaan,19-Nov-16,1,"Loved it at first. It was pre-installed bloatware on my Note 5 but since I was a Prime member I started using it. Lots of great music, easy to build play lists. Trouble is that the app got to a point where it needed an update but every time I attempt to update it failed. This is true of the Kindle app as well. Per some Amazon and Android forums I cleared my app cache, no change, Uninstalled and attempted to reinstall. Now the app cannot install at all. I hit generic Android errors and there are no good fixes that I have found on any Android or Amazon search. Downloading from Google Play or Amazon App Store makes no difference. That said, it may not be fair to rate the App so low when it's possibly an OS issue but other downloaded apps are behaving normally."

Don't get me wrong, if you want a cloud service, that's a decent deal.  I just wanted a good music player on my phone for music that is already on my phone.  That's all.  For giving me a nice player, they got my business when I needed to purchase a song.  But that is gone, and I switched to Google Play Music.  It will do.  I don't like it as much yet, but I haven't used it long.  And now they will make the money when I decide to buy a song.  I completely deleted the Amazon app from my phone."

Amazon,Amazon is Deceptive with this new Prime Music Rollout,OogieJones,20-Jun-14,1,"There is absolutely no mention that this new Prime Music Application will not work with the 1st Generation Kindle Fire.  After screwing around with my Kindle for  hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told "" your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle"".  WTF!!!!  I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information.  If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices."

Martin,28-Oct-16,1,"Klunky, frequent user interface lockups and crashes, and can't play songs without hiccupping, pausing, and crashing - and that's just from downloaded, local storage on my phone!  Considering that playing a local audio file has been done smoothly by PCs since about 1988, this is a big disappointment.  If it wasn't required to utilize my Amazon Prime music, I would ditch this one in a heartbeat.  I have already wasted too many minutes of my life working with this app."

Amazon,syncs music very well to multiple devices,KimandItsy,7-Feb-13,4,"The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal. That was my criteria for choosing this type of app. I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi. I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space. There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great. How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service. The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing, as well"

Amazon,"Great App, a couple changes suggested",Lance E. Coleman,19-Apr-11,5,"I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player.  I've put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3.  Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.Great updates."

Amazon,Works greast,ML Schmidt,5-Oct-12,5,Needed it for a hypnosis track I needed to download to my laptop as well as my tablet and it works great.
Amazon,needs widget,Amazon Customer,4-Jan-12,4,This AP desperately needs a widget option since playing music from your cloud drive does integrate with any of the native music players.
Amazon,best app ever,Hockeymom13,29-Apr-13,5,This app is the app for you and it is fun I love it get it is so cool get it
Amazon,Wonderful.,JoeyGee,12-Jun-14,5,"I just wish it could pull music from my Google collection. The new update is excellent, I must say! The only downside to it, which is minor, is that it is locked in portrait mode. Getting that fixed and the ability to include and stream valid mp3s from,  or merge with, Google music library."
Amazon,Will not open.,Amazon Customer,12-Jul-12,1,This app will not work on my galaxy note with ICS.I have uninstalled and re installed several times with no luck.
Amazon,I like that there is music available on Amazon,David Bartholomew,28-Apr-17,3,"I like that there is music available on Amazon, but the selection isn't super without paying extra and the app freezes my phone all of the time.  If I were paying for music I would go with another service, but it is music and I do occasionally use it."
Amazon,love it,StL Cujo,8-Mar-12,5,works great on my HTC EVO. never had issues with playback and the sound quality is great. it is dangerously convenient though.
Amazon,great.,Beechnut,1-Apr-11,5,"I know you can download music for free, but that doesn't support the artists who make it.  This is far above the apple music store."

Amazon,VERY DISAPPOINTED BUT YET HOPEFUL...,LowCarberForLife,23-Jun-14,1,"FIRST OFF SPOTIFY (FREE NOT PREMIUM) IS BY FAR THE BEST MUSIC APP.  I KNEW THAT SINCE AMAZON PRIME MUSIC JUST LAUNCHED I WOULD HAVE TO LOWER MY EXPECTATIONS BUT THE SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE THAN I EXPECTED.THE USER INTERFACE IS CLUNKY NOT STREAMLINED LIKE SPOTIFY ETC.  WHEN I CLICK ON A PLAYLIST IN MY LIBRARY I CAN NEVER GET THE PLAYLIST TO PLAY ON MY CELL PHONE...KEEP GETTING MESSAGE ""ERROR...PLEASE TRY BACK LATER OR CONTACT AMAZON.""I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH AMAZON AND THEIR PRODUCTS (PRIME TV, FIRE TABLETS ETC.) SO I AM FOREVER HOPEFUL THAT THEY CAN TURN AROUND WHAT HAS BEEN A DISASTER UNTIL NOW TO EVENTUALLY COMPETE WITH, IF NOT SURPASS, SPOTIFY'S AWESOME SERVICE."
Amazon,Great!,S. Hutchins,10-Sep-12,5,"I use this App on my iPad. It's easy, fast and the audio and video are fabulous!!! I highly recommend!"

Amazon,works great on my s5,Paleogirl,9-May-17,5,"like I said, works great on my s5 phone. but you would think that it being Amazon music it would work on your Kindle. Nope, don't even have it available for download on the Kindle. Go figure. but its nice to have the app on my phone for travel."
Amazon,great app,phynal,29-Mar-11,5,"Cloud is where its at,  not sure about battery drain yet,  but seems ok so far. You can also get 20gb for free if you buy an album by the end of the year."
Amazon,A Royal Pain in Her Majesty's Ass,Daniel Lyddy,4-Feb-16,2,"While playing music from Amazon Prime channels, this app frequently stops playing songs about a half a minute before said songs are supposed to finish. I then get 30 seconds of silence before the next song plays.I have other online streaming music apps on my Android phone (SiriusXM, Pandora, TuneIn), and NONE of them exhibit this annoying behavior ... so it's not my phone, and it's not my network connection; it's this buggy app.Dear Amazon: you're supposed to be providing me with entertainment, not agita."
Amazon,Excellent App!,Amazon Customer,7-Sep-12,5,Love this app. I am able to access all of my music in my Cloud Player with just a touch of a button.
Amazon,Almost perfect,Book Reader42,21-Aug-12,4,Almost perfect. My problem with this ap is I have over 2000 songs but it only shows me 2k. Why Amazon?

Amazon,The most usefl app ever... hahahahah that was funny...,Heywood Jableaume,22-Jul-11,2,I hardly ever use it. Most of my music won't show up on it. Its problaby because of how it was ripped. Needs more codec support I guess (???).

Amazon,Music Music  and more Music!,kittylover,4-Jan-14,5,"This is a great app for my phone,mp3 player and tablet. If I don't want to sync to my music on my toys I can still hear them all thru cloud. I like buying singles alot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do alot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!"
Amazon,Not US version.....,Me,31-Dec-11,1,This is UK only. Prices show in pounds an no cloud drive access. Worthless and cant uninstall. 18 19 2o words to post????!!!
Amazon,Great product but crashes a lot,Hutch,29-Jan-12,4,Love the amazon mp3 idea.  I put 12k of my mp3s into the cloud.  This software needs more work ..getting there though ...
Amazon,"It's great, but crashes constantly",flyerfier,4-May-12,3,It's very unstable on my motorola photon.. Requires me to restart the whole phone to get the app running again
Amazon,No longer great,Mi Wa,4-Oct-11,1,"Shame on amazon.  This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen, nor can you search for it through the app!!!!  :-("
Amazon,Very Satisfied,Linda B,15-Jul-16,4,"I love how it works and the ease of use, however it doesn't have the variety I would like to see. I am pleased with the service overall and my husband recently became a prime member just for prime music. I love that I can use it on any computer/tablet that I can log into my Amazon account on without having to download anything. There is a smartphone/tablet app that I use because it takes me to straight to prime music without going in though my account. I have had other music programs in the past that I couldn't use at work because they required me to download a program to use on my work computer. That is not the case here and I really like that."
Amazon,great,Luigiyoshi,3-Jul-12,4,"The only thing I think it needs is a complete my album option to get five stars. Otherwise, great app."
Amazon,Frustrating!,Amazon Customer,5-Jul-14,1,"Love Amazon.  Absolutely love the new Prime Music.  But why oh why can I not access music in my digital music library from my HTC phone like I used to before this new app took over?  I shelled out $30 for the larger storage space and was enjoying it constantly until one day a bunch of my music was gone.  Even worse, songs I've since imported into my cloud library and songs I've purchased from Amazon on my pc are not accessible on my HTC via the new app.  Until this is fixed, Amazon has lost my digital download business.  So sad."
Amazon,Mp3,lthomas,9-Sep-12,5,I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems.
Amazon,"Simple, Secure, & Safe",JJ,14-Feb-12,5,"Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's ""cloud"" was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go.The MP3 ""downloader"" was even easier...Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I don't have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! (YAY!!!)  =)"
Amazon,very good,Bruce S. Garlock,1-Apr-11,4,thinking of switching from iTunes now.  just needs a little eye candy and ui clean up :-) cloud option is very good.  thanks for the free storage.
Amazon,wonderful,Suki Anderson,30-Jan-12,5,"Very easy to use, no worrys, sound is great, lay out is good.  Easy to find songs and albums. Like the player and eq."
Amazon,change log?,G. G.,9-Apr-11,3,"Maybe it's just me, but I refuse to update if the developer will not take the time to write up a change log.what was fixed? what was added?"
Amazon,"Nice, but now broken",Wdeagle,3-Sep-11,3,"I really loved this app, but now it locks up my atrix, will use google music until they figure it out.... Please get it fixed"
Amazon,Music on the Phone Made Easy,soul4real,10-Dec-11,5,This is the best way to get all of your music on your smart phone without having to have a lot of memory. Great app.
Amazon,Can't get US version,Bliss Bignall,4-Dec-11,1,I have downloaded the MP3 player several times and only get the UK version.  No cloud access.  Anyone that can help?
Amazon,Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums ...,E. R.,23-Oct-14,4,"Overall pretty good. I love that I can stream albums from the Prime library. I'm not sure if there is a way to download them onto my phone and play them through the app that way, but it's not a big deal.Reason I gave it four stars is due to layout and navigation. I should be able to click on the artist's name from any song and see all albums/songs by that artist. Also, sometimes the buttons get stuck below the display area of my phone (3.5"" phone). I also see that it runs a bit sluggish (1 ghz phone).Again, pretty good app and I'm happy with it. Hopefully we'll see some improvements and make this a truly outstanding app/service."
Amazon,tuned in,Amazon Customer,17-Nov-11,5,"I've used it a few times, and it worked good.  Try it you'll like it.  Saves a lot of room on you're tablet."
Amazon,Moved on,PAJeff,31-Oct-11,3,I got away from this Amazon app and moved on to a generic app. Music Search and Download is what I use now.
Amazon,There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request but I'm not happy in doing,M. Renee,25-Oct-16,1,It wont load into my Droid Turbo 2. There is an error message even after I change the security functions on my phone they request that I'm not happy in doing. This is the WORST. I sent a report but no response.Not only can I not use it. I also don't have access to my paid library of music because I the old app that DID work is no longer available from what I've found. Thus Amazon owe me a couple hundred dollars in music. They should have left the old MP3 app available til they worked the bugs out. But like most large entities this days it's about the bottom line not the consumers needs.
Amazon,No more free song,Amazon Customer,9-Oct-11,1,Why did the daily free song disappear??? It use to be there. There is no reason to use this app then. 1 star.
Amazon,DOES NOT WORK,Donny Brassco,29-Jun-14,1,"No trace of this app on my kindle, tech support says to be patient - why should I be patient?  If something isn't ready, don't put it on your website or store shelves.  Bought a kindle fire just to use this app but it doesn't exist."
Amazon,Wth,Amazon Customer,11-Oct-11,2,What happend to the free song of the day ): Bring back and i'll add two stars. Everything else works well.
Amazon,love it,cat,16-Apr-14,4,Now I can have my music whereever I go without having to take along a separate mp player. my grandkids like it because it has their favorite music on there as well. You can play from the cloud or download to your mobile device.
Amazon,It's almost like they don't want you to use it,E. Nelson,3-Mar-15,1,"Oh, man...I was really hoping this would allow me to get rid of Spotify Premium and save some $$ each month. False. This app has one of the least user-friendly interfaces I've ever experienced. It's almost like they don't want you to use it...I'm really hoping they get this fixed, because it was a large part of why I renewed my Prime membership for another year."
Amazon,Doesn't work,Matt,25-Dec-16,1,Keeps on giving me an authentication error exception #117
Amazon,Keeps getting better,B. Shaw,26-Apr-11,4,"The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets, 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up."
Amazon,The importing process from iTunes was no easy task and as I use it with my Samsung ...,JP Amznfan,15-May-15,3,The importing process from iTunes was no easy task and as I use it with my Samsung network speakers (purchased through Amazon) it is not smooth. I know it is Amazon music because the stream from network works fine while the stream from Amazon jumps and cuts off songs. For the price and nearly unlimited number of songs it gets 3 stars.
Amazon,Garbage! Will not install,John Kirk,28-Sep-16,1,"This crap will not install! Tried numerous times, read tons of reviews of others with the same problem.  Amazon tech can't get it to work either.  This app is junk and amazon prime delivery is terrible also, they're consistently late but they're late taking my hundred bucks. They blame it on the UPS, USPS AND OTHER CARRIERS.  ALL THIS IS AMAZONS MISMANAGEMENT!!!  Love to see Amazon bankrupt"
Amazon,A Must for Amazon Prime Subscribers,Jaxon,27-Oct-14,4,"This is app is a must if you have invested in Amazon Prime and want to make the most of the music resources available.  Works equally well on my Kindle, Nexus  7 tablet and Android phone (Galaxy S 5).  Having access to a relatively rich and varied library gives the user more personal control than streaming services.  The pre-selected  playlists are entertaining and the ability to create your own playlists is good.  I primarily take advantage of the music that is freely accessible through my Prime account.  I have not purchased any songs or albums.  The app, itself, is clean, straightforward and easy to use."
Amazon,"I really want to live this app, and I ss",Tamar Goldberg,21-Feb-12,2,"I rally want to love this app, and I did for the first couple of days - it has two odd the features I want in a music player: good lock screen and it remembers the last song that played even if it was closed for days.and then I tried the shuffle button on the songs list, it showed me 0 out of 0 songs and when I tried to get out of there it crashed. since I dint want to create a play list for shuffling over all my songs, this is more or less a deal breaker.I would also love to have the option of uploading songs to the cloudThis review is for the galaxy s2 on Sprint"
Amazon,Bug fix,Akki,18-Oct-11,1,Crashed at start up and now wouldnt open fix the bug. Got a froze and than black screen. Oh no
Amazon,"great app, great service",pc.pc,11-Oct-17,5,"really impressed for an early stage, post adopter app quality/function and enormous library all amazing, look forward to seeing what is next and how it competes against the newly merged rivals"
Amazon,Nice App,Jeremy M.,18-Jun-11,5,"Plenty of storage available for free. I  use it mostly for sharing access to my mp3s between multiple devices. Not sure how well the streaming works or how much bandwidth it consumes, but the are nice options to allow you to limit downloads while using cellular networks, which may keep you from getting an unpleasant data charge from your provider."
Amazon,Don't,Jason Ziegler,7-Jun-16,1,"Came to Amazon to download a single mp3 legally. Didn't get the song version right, cause the sample was too short to tell. Also I had to download an app to be able to listen and download song. Ridiculous! Already uninstalled!"
Amazon,This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left ...,Michele Anderson,25-Feb-15,1,"Where's the metal? It's all mainstream. I am constantly let down by Pandora and other so called music apps. I am a metal head who can truly recognize talent in any music I hear. This app is nothing but an extension of the over pampered, over rated, computer synthesized, failure of music today. This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left today that still has true heart. Sadly, even many of the hearts of this genera is selling out faster than American Idol can ruin the youth who watch and silently dream of this pop music crap."
Amazon,My music on my device!,August W McKenna,16-Dec-13,5,"I love that the music purchased from this app lets me choose what device I want to play it on.  Other e-music publishers, will only let you play their music on their devices.  However, I can purchase a song on my android, play it on my windows PC, and load it onto my iPod to listen to whenever I want.  Also, I am always able to stream the music (when data connected) from the Amazon Cloud.Keep it up Amazon, this is what purchasing all online media should be like!"
Amazon,Mostly great,J. White,15-Oct-14,4,"It's almost fabulous. I don't have an iPhone so I can't get my iTunes unless I'm at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I'm out and about. My one star less is because there's no way (that I've found) to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I'll wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying my tunes :-)"
Amazon,Auto-Rip Rocks!,KS Rocks!,14-Feb-13,5,"I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
Amazon,Convenient library streaming,Justin F,29-Sep-17,5,"Nice to be able to stream 250 of my mp3s. I would probably go for the expanded service if I had a ton more music I wanted to access remotely always, or if it was a bit cheaper."
Amazon,Love amazon music!,Amazon Customer,16-May-16,4,"Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far,  is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
Amazon,A must have for prime members,Antsinthepants,30-Jul-16,5,Excellent music app for prime members. Loads of free playlists and stations that you can stream on your phone or tablet. The app lets you add songs to playlists and your library.
Amazon,Get Yo Jammin' On!,Arielle,8-Jun-16,5,"I absolutely LOVE this feature! This app is AMAZING! I really don't know how i listened to music before this! If you have Prime, or your thinking about getting Prime, get this app. You wont regret it!"
Amazon,not what i was expecting,Kirby Gold,18-Feb-14,2,"To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
Amazon,A piece of garbage,Camille Lambert,24-Aug-11,1,"App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
Amazon,Used All My Data...Battery Hog As Well,Zigzagmolly,23-Jun-14,1,All of a sudden I have used almost 4GB of data. I made sure the app was set to download via Wi-Fi only and the next day another 2.5GB was downloaded. And the battery drain on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was amazingly slow...until I installed Amazon music and then half of it was gone in half a day with very little use. It appears it automatically syncs with the cloud every 10 minutes without any option for adjustment. Why would I need to sync every 10 minutes? Very disappointing. Uninstalled it from ALL our phones. Please fix these issues!
Amazon,average.,Joshua Campodonico,21-Oct-15,3,offline has many Glitches. offline should not require Loading that's the whole point of Offline so I find it reacting like its buffering. needs offline quality setting added
Amazon,poor,Chele,15-Jun-14,1,"Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play.  I get ""exception 119"" or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of ""free"" (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play....."
Amazon,"Money Talks, Eh?",Phillip C. Holloway,21-Oct-14,3,"I think it's great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone.  Since it's bundled with Prime Instant Video, I'm not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the $99.00 that I'm being charged.  When I want to buy something, I'm told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee (I live abroad).  However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card.  Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical?"
Amazon,Fantastic App,Camile Bailey,18-Jun-16,5,I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone.
Amazon,Great extra with the prime membership,Cinomod,31-Oct-14,4,"Great extra with the prime membership.  I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have.  I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music.  It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly.  I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
Amazon,I'd give it 0 starts if I could.  AWFUL app,Laura Milburn,10-Jan-15,1,"It froze up frequently requiring me to pull the battery to reboot my phone, a brand new Samsung S5.  I never could get it to recognize my amazon account,  so I couldn't stream prime music or even retrieve albums I've purchased.  It was a huge resource and battery hog too.  After trying a second install and an update I gave up and deleted it.  Canceled my prime membership too."
Amazon,I like the cost versus some other guys,Amazon Consumer,21-Oct-17,5,I like the cost versus some other guys.  There are some tracks that I cannot find though.  But the price makes it all better.
Amazon,Great tunes,Amazon Customer,23-Jun-17,5,Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's didn't hammer us with usage charges
Amazon,Can't use it,Jon McAvoy,16-Jun-14,2,"I suppose it may be OK, but since I am an ""Invited Guest"" of a Prime member (my wife), I can't use it on my smartphone or Kindle Fire (my wife has neither so there's zero chance of having more than one device using it at a time).  I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is.  Tough luck, I guess.  I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora."
Amazon,My music library!,Beelissa,19-Feb-13,5,"I have turned my back on iTunes. This is my music library now. I have this app on my phone and I can download whatever songs I want from my Amazon library. I can download music I've purchased from Amazon or songs I've uploaded (like the songs I imported from my old iTunes. Once the song is on my phone, I can listen even if I'm not in a WiFi area, and it doesn't need my data minutes either. You can sort by artist or album or song or genre, and you can make playlists too."
Amazon,So much bugs,Valiryon,1-Feb-17,1,"After opening app, the first time after a while ""+ Add album to my music""  button is pressed I am redirected to an amazon prime screen, and the album I selected is lost. It takes multiple attempts to purchase mp3s. Headache after headache using the store."
Amazon,Amazon.com reminds me of the Clinton email scandal....,Amazon Customer,28-Oct-16,1,"Never installed....and the new version of amazon and Amazon video sucks.  I  am bot planning on renewing my yearly subscription.  I believe that Amazon is doing this intentionally to discourage people and fix their money issue they saythat Amazon prime has caused them.  Shame on you if this is true, you took our money well enough and now that it has caused you some issue in the delivery side, you start to have download and launch issues."
Amazon,Fantastic little program!,Lori Trueblood,13-Jun-17,5,Love this player when I am not on a computer.  I can listen to music anytime I want with headphone or ear plugs!
Amazon,It is the worst music app yet,KRONIK801,27-Jan-16,1,It is the worst music app yet.the update pop up won't quit.i just deleted the app..it only about money to this website. an you guys need to catch up with eBay on the fees ypu chatge an keep the customers money for 21 dayz like them.imagine the money from interest ypu collect on other people's money.
Amazon,serves all of my music needs,SkirmishofWit,1-Aug-12,5,I have been using this app for a year on my android phone (Verizon droid razr).  I uploaded all of the music I own (aprox 15gb) to my cloud drive and use the amazon mp3 app in place of the music app provided by android.  I love that it lets me play music on my phone or in my cloud from anywhere or purchase music and play it without having to download.  A few glitches here and there but the features and ease of use far outweigh any drawbacks for me.
Amazon,Five Stars,luis ortiz,1-Oct-16,5,ok
Amazon,Boooo,Blake Bigelow,28-Aug-17,1,Wife bought me a CD for my birthday and its not shared through her prime account...do we really both have to buy it that's retarded...
Amazon,I don't like Pandora!,Jeem Jam,13-Jan-15,5,"I listen to what I want,don't have to mess around with thumbs down and I love everything that goes with the package,I'm Primed!"
Amazon,Music,Tom T,19-Mar-15,5,"I have listened to a lot of the Prime Music that I had lost track of through the years. It is hard to keep up with the format changes, records, tapes, 8-tracks,and CD's. For instance....I hadn't listened to Joni Mitchell in years and found her music as delightful as I did in the 60's. I have a bluetooth speaker to use with my Android, and a computer connected to my A-V system and it has been wonderful to have access to so much music in an instant."
Amazon,Useless on my android phone,A. Moore,2-Aug-14,1,The app is more frustration than enjoyment on my Android phone.  I have given up on it working and have uninstalled it.
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,30-Mar-17,5,I love my Amazon Music.  It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime.
Amazon,Doesn't work,Desi,23-Jun-14,1,"I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs won't download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music,Jeff,16-Jun-14,3,"I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time."
Amazon,Cloud Player was mind changer for me.,Nate Shapley,23-Feb-13,4,"Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
Amazon,Nice to have some free download options as a benefit ...,Joseph Vallandingham,21-Sep-14,3,"Nice to have some free download options as a benefit for having prime; however, it would also be nice to be able to listen to those free songs through another music app i.e. poweramp. I understand why, but what good is having cake if you can't eat it, too?That being said, I think all other aspects of this app, based on my brief experience thus far, are wonderful and the average user/listener would really enjoy what it has to offer."
Amazon,Boooooo,Amazon Customer,21-Jun-17,1,Lowest ratings possible; because it does not work in my country of Trinidad and Tobago
Amazon,"Nice, but room to improve",PBFT,28-Oct-14,3,"Nice idea but still room for improvement. Android app user interface isn't as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist doesn't exist or has eluded my search so far.That said, the audio quality seems fine and it's a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership."
Amazon,"I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money",David M. Ocame,18-Jul-15,5,"Use it for dinner parties, for everything! I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money!"
Amazon,Not what I expect from Amazon,Haroldwolf,26-Apr-11,1,"I have downloaded the app and on my Samsung Galaxy S I find I am connected to Amazon MP3 UK. UK? I live in the US. I can't find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they don't know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I don't want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.Great idea but the app isn't ready for prime time."
Amazon,"Great idea, but annoying",keipper,19-Jan-16,2,"I was so excited about this app until I actually tried to use it much. First off, the music I download disappears all the time and I have to redownload, which is a pain in the butt.Secondly, the music stutters when I try to play it via the headphone jack, which means it's practically useless to me since I primarily use it to listen to music in the car.Back to Google play music I go. =/"
Amazon,"It's free, and it works with my cloud music collection",Pfoggy,21-Feb-13,3,"While it's pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches)."
Amazon,Fantastic App!!!,John & Sue Hofmann,7-Feb-13,5,"I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it.  All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service.  You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone.  It's great!"
Amazon,Five Stars,John W.,17-Sep-17,5,I love the instant rip and available music with my prime subscription.
Amazon,... downloadable trough prime subscription not just some but I like the selection available,bryon gaudreau,21-Oct-14,4,Wish all music was downloadable trough prime subscription not just some but I like the selection available
Amazon,This program is not just bad its damaging.,Jonathan,30-Jun-11,1,"I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."
Amazon,Two Stars,Rosemary Boatwright,24-Jun-17,2,"New, haven't figured out how to use yet. 7/31/17 still have not used this. please cancel anything that I have to pay for. it is too technical for me to enjoy. I signed up for a free month, but I have not used it and I want it cancelled. please do not charge me for any music, or videos.please cancel this. thanks, Rosemary"
Amazon,works great,Laura,3-Aug-12,4,"Not sure why people give this one star just because they can't uninstall it. That's not the apps fault that you bought a phone with pre loaded apps. I use this on a galaxy nexus and it works great. It remains to be seen how the ""improvements"" to the cloud player will affect those who do not pay but I have been pleased with Amazon cloud player since I started using it."
Amazon,Great Music App!,Mike1sc,14-Oct-14,5,Great music app with a ton of free music if you have Amazon Prime.  I love it!
Amazon,One Star,SK Hamilton,25-Sep-17,1,Worthless if you can't get the prime member music
Amazon,Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better.,Amazon Customer,22-Jun-17,5,Its waaaay louder than spotify was. I had to max my car out and have treble all the way up to hear songs. Now my radio is on 40 and treble is down and is way better.
Amazon,Love this app,Joyce P.,9-Feb-17,5,"I get all the music I want, right to my phone. I love this."
Amazon,Four Stars,DeAnn,22-Oct-14,4,Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members.
Amazon,"If you don't want to pay, you're only allowed to look",Riley Davis,23-Mar-17,1,"So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app? Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to ""free music"" with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
Amazon,It's music to my ears,Michael Asher,18-Mar-15,5,"One of the unexpected benefits of Amazon prime is the music service that comes with it. Download the Amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files. You can stream them our download them to your phone. They are available as full albums, individual songs, or listen to preselected playlists. Get Amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it."
Amazon,Five Stars,Kindle Customer,14-Jan-15,5,"Easy to use, great selection of free music if you are a prime member."
Amazon,Good,Amazon Customer,20-Jan-13,4,"This is good app to store most, not all my music (only because I haven't paid the $25 annual fee). Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources (PC, tablet or cell). If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!"
Amazon,has potential,markie petty,20-Mar-15,5,"I haven't  had any issues. I don't care if I don't have enough  memory  on my 16gb galaxy s4, my 64gb sd card is useless  because  I can't store anything  from here on it. So yes it uses up all my memory. I don't care. I get to listen to my music, and buy new songs as they come out. I'm always listening to music. I just wish the app didn't take up so much of my memory."
Amazon,The BEST,Frank,10-Feb-13,5,I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can't sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere.IT IS AWESOME....DownLOAD it now...why are you still reading this..go download.
Amazon,Amazon Rocks.,Terry L. Bell,9-Oct-14,5,"Just want to say Thank You Amazon.Since I love music so much, you made it so easy to listen to them.I love the many choices I have to listen to, not limited to just certain ones.So easy to find and navigate and explore.I even told my family and friends to join up. They sure wont be disappointed at all.Keep up the Good Work.Love Ya Guys."
Amazon,Four Stars,J.Crowley,5-May-17,4,There's some decent music on it but the variety is limited.
Amazon,I love my Prime membership,C. DUPONT,4-Jun-17,5,"I'm a music love and as such, will try out everything available.  Amazon is the most recent musical trip I've taken and it might be that I've reached my home for music.  I've been a Prime member for many years and it's paid for itself over and over.  This is just another reason my membership has worked for me."
Amazon,New tunes stuck in jail with no key to get out.,peter reiser,18-Oct-16,1,Amazon lacks the ability to share files or it hides instructions or directions on how to do it. I just purchased a number of Adele tunes but can't transfer them to my Google play library.  Why?
Amazon,Music only on internal storage?,Ryan D. Unger,12-Feb-13,1,This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company.
Amazon,Good music,ceejack,8-Oct-17,5,Good app easy to use.good music.
Amazon,Five Stars,Duchess,13-Oct-17,5,Easy to get. easy to use. Love this!!!!
Amazon,Frequent errors and crashes,Sefton,13-Oct-14,1,"App crashes if I try to use it without an internet connection, and gives frequent errors while streaming. Haven't been able to listen to a single full album. Just terrible"
Amazon,Not so much...,B. Wood,9-Oct-17,1,Damn confusing...I gave up :(
Amazon,Five Stars,Dallyce Morris,21-Jun-17,5,"Amazing, far better than pandora."
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,31-Mar-17,5,It is very reliable price.
Amazon,Five Stars,girlrunning,29-Apr-17,5,you got music any time any where
Amazon,Worthwhile for Prime Members at Least,CC,9-Oct-14,4,"As an Android user and an Amazon Prime member, I got this app to take advantage of the Prime Music Amazon now offers for free for their Prime subscribers.  It is functional and the music selection has improved vastly since it started up this summer.  If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and have an Android device you might as well take advantage of this."
Amazon,Answers All Of My Music Needs For Now,Wally,25-Mar-17,5,Very good deal for $8 per month!
Amazon,Get google music instead,DoctorMu,24-Oct-16,1,clunky and not as good as Google Music
Amazon,Great app!!,Janet,19-Jun-17,5,Unlike other music apps we have tried Amazon music does not have ads or commercials and I love that.
Amazon,Garbage in the first degree,GMGCPA,9-Jul-14,1,Garbage in the first degree...a long time amazon music purchaser...now I'm shut out as on my samsung S3 downloads aren't in my library...uninstalled reinstalled wasted a lot of time...now can't login to it on my phone...I'm very tech savvy so the fault is with the amazon music app...deleted...used to work great...on to spotify or dare I say...iTunes...ugh
Amazon,WTF... Seriously!,K. Myers,13-Jun-14,1,"Broke will not work on Samsung Galaxy Note. Tried Google play and Amazon apps, Google says it's already downloaded (it's not) and Amazon says it's incompatible... Seriously, WTF?"
Amazon,Better than Itunes,Deborah Cruise,14-Feb-13,5,"I completely changed from Itunes due to their many restrictions. I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices. So Amazon music is the only place I now purchase from, and it is saved in my account for me to access at all times anywhere."
Amazon,No Genre? REALLY??,Frank Imburgio,7-Nov-11,1,I can't believe it but I don't see a way to play all music by genre. This option appears in the web based player but its not on the Android software.How can this be left out??One star until this is fixed. The Google music beta wins hands-down.This is a must have feature!Boo.
Amazon,Five Stars,Al,31-Mar-17,5,great gift
Amazon,... had this app since it came out and I love it. However,AstroTrio,19-Mar-15,5,"I've had this app since it came out and I love it. However, last night I downloaded Android 5.1 to my phone, now Amazon music player crashes whenever I hit play on any Prime Music. Please fix!! My morning commute is not the same!!UPDATE 3/23/15: got the 5.1 fix installed, happy days are here again! Changing to 5 stars, thanks Amazon!"
Amazon,OnePlus & Ouya compatibility,Sean Crago,24-Oct-14,1,"Hugely unstable on OnePlus One (and apparently other OPO devices) for several subsequent releases. Unusably flaky on an Ouya. Amazon kindly flags the app as uninstallable on the OnePlus in the Google Play store, but still enables access to the app on both devices through their own. Left hand, meet right hand. Or better yet: Just fix it."
Amazon,Yay!,Ana Q,17-Jun-14,5,"Finally!  This is great so far, I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music, so the transition wasn't bad for me.  My only criticism is that their catalog for streaming is not that big, but I understand that this is because the service is brand new.  I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase.  Thank you Amazon!"
Amazon,Great selection,Joe,11-Apr-17,5,Great selection
Amazon,Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was ...,Philip Kroupa,21-Oct-14,4,"Works well with a few exceptions. Wish there was a way to delete downloaded items just off my device when I need to free up storage, there's always a little freeze in the playback when I'm streaming over Bluetooth and I lock my phone, and on android can be way too complicated to kill the app. Other than that I'm really satisfied"
Amazon,Amazon MP3 to the rescue,J. Archie,13-Feb-13,4,"There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train."
Amazon,Five Stars,Gator,1-Jul-17,5,Love it
Amazon,App works well.,Sara,23-Apr-14,4,I like being able to get my Cloud music and play it on my phone. The one problem I have with it is that without me adding them in there it picked up ringtones I had downloaded to my phone and put them in my list of songs. I had to manually go through and delete all of them which was a bit annoying. Other than that it works well.
Amazon,"Is constantly ""looking"" for the cloud",Kevin Weaver,5-Jun-13,3,The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone.
Amazon,Great APP,Dexter,25-Feb-13,5,"It took two neices and three freinds to convience me to get this app to help me work my new tablet and they were right. This is a great app to find other great apps. I am not sure I would ever be able to work the computer but now I have all types of helpful and fun apps on my tablet, thanks to Amazon and my family."
Amazon,No longer works on the OnePlus One!!!,69gm,23-Oct-14,1,"This app used to work fine on my OnePlus One, but now it crashes all the time.  Please fix ASAP so that I can enjoy it once again.I believe there might be a compatibility issue with the latest CM 38R update?"
Amazon,kept refreshing and bumping me off the net,Amazon Customer,9-Mar-13,1,No problems before I downloaded this app. After downloading Net would disconnect every 2 -3 minutes. UNINSTALLED after 20 minutes. No problems now And then I tried to install the cloud player.... can't find the widget... and it is also unstable on the site. I try to play something and it will just stop playing.
Amazon,Five Stars,leisay88,18-Oct-14,5,Love love love

Amazon,issues with version from amazon app store,Tyler,24-May-11,3,"i had this app downloaded via the amazon app store for a few weeks and i constantly had issues with it. downloaded from the android market, and it works fine.streaming at times takes just a little bit too long on 3G (as opposed to google music beta. which is nearly instant)"
Amazon,"bugged, broken or just bad design?",robert,12-May-11,1,Can't even install it because my default language isn't english. oh wait my phones default language is english. fail.i've never had this issue before with any other app. why not just take this setting out and let us select what language we would like to install the app in.
Amazon,Five Stars,r&amp;amp;d pena,22-Mar-15,5,Outstanding hands down
Amazon,10 STARS,Jon,11-Feb-13,5,Perfect. Fast downloads. Much better than itunes. The new auto-rip feature for cds is wonderful. I hope it will include vinyl in the future. (Sooner rather than later)  Love it love it love it!!!
Amazon,Really quite good,Iain,2-Sep-15,5,"This is really really good. What can I say?  All sorts of music, even the obscure stuff that I like. Free to stream within your annual prime subscription. I stream musiic at home, at work and on the train.  The movies are rubbish, but the music and free next day delivery are worth the å£70 a year."
Amazon,Works great!,Josh,20-Feb-13,5,"This is my go-to app for all music now.  Once you go Amazon, you can't go back... or something like that.  Great product....easy to use... have some issuesa saving mp3s to my SD card on my phone.....so I just save them like normal, then use a file manager app to move them where I actually want them :p"
Amazon,Ejoying The Benefits of Prime!!!!,Sheldon Brown,18-Mar-15,5,I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash. What I liked most of all was the access to the many music playlists that are available and also the music that had been on my wish list for years were made available through Prime. Thank you. Yours Truly a future Prime Member.
Amazon,Easy access,Timebandit,10-Feb-13,5,"I love the way I can go either on my phone, or my laptop and search for music etc. I already have an account with Amazon, so everything downloads  instantly, and without problems. If I should have a problem, it is usually very easy to fix."
Amazon,This is a reminder...,Rachel Roman,17-Mar-17,1,On how spoiled I was when I had my Google play music subscription. Amazon music just cannot compete with the real deal. Google Play also gets Youtube Red that alone is worth the price.
Amazon,Stupid..,D. Wahlroos,9-May-11,1,The app functionality is fine. But starts itself even if I'm not using it. I was there for love to uninstall it however there install put it under system so I can't. how do I remove 1 of those? and whose stupid idea was it to install it under system by default...
Amazon,UPDATED Force Close when opening Settings menu or play,D. Wollmann,27-Apr-11,1,"UPDATE After review of system event log it appears there is a conflict with an EQ library loaded by the Equalizer app. After stopping this app Amazon MP3 player works fine, no Force Close. After loading Amazon MP3 Player, the Equalizer app says the device does not support Reverb effect, so it looks like two conflicting libraries using the same API and if Amazon's loads first both programs can co-exist but with reduced functionality in Equalizer.Useless. Any attempt to open the settings menu or play music causes a Force Close. Test this code on Google flagship phones before you release it, ya big dorks.Nexus S"
Amazon,Streaming on Nexus7,Capt. Talon,10-Nov-12,5,I use this app on my Nexus7 and have had no problems. Streams my purchased music and personal uploads to my tablet with no problems.
Amazon,Good way to stream music,Michael J Worthley-Seldon,16-Jun-14,4,"I will admit this isn't the best music streaming app, but if you are a prime member, I'd say it is a must have. I have had trouble finding a couple of songs/albums in the prime/free streaming section, but for the most part I can find what I am looking for or something that is close enough."
Amazon,"I love listening to my music on here, and is easy to put on protable devices.",alex,9-Feb-13,4,"I love being able to carry my music everywhere I go without buy the same songs two or three times. This is an easy way to put songs onto multiple portable devices, and maintain them for long periods of time. You also don't have to buy the same tracks for each device which is convient."
Amazon,... music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to,Duane Patton,18-Mar-15,5,"I listen to a LOT of music and have found several thousand songs that I enjoy listening to.  And it's really great to have all this available on my desktop, laptop, tablet and phone!  SIMPLY WONDERFUL!  The recent updates to the music app make it easy to use.  GOOD WORK AMAZON!"
Amazon,Fun.......,RevDoc,18-Feb-13,5,What a fun little AP !!I have it on all of my electronics.  SO far no glitches. It was difficult for my tablet to get itself onboard but once it was........... super!  It was a tablet issue not the AP issue.  TRY IT!!!!
Amazon,Five Stars,young k lim,1-Jan-17,5,very gooood! thank you Amazon music
Amazon,"Not for me, even though free.",NVW,28-Oct-14,3,"Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks & albums.  Just no way I'm gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it's free (for Prime members).Going back to Rhapsody."
Amazon,amazing,Todd,11-Nov-11,5,"This is honestly the best app ever. I uploaded all of my CDs to the cloud, and I use it to listen to my music on my computer in my office. I can also plug my phone into my cars stereo and it works great even over 3g."
Amazon,Easy to use,Daniel Rebert,14-Feb-13,5,"Works exceptionally well.  i purchased a CD and the Cloud/Bitrate option to download Apocalyptica's ""Worlds Collide"" album.  Unlike most of you who might read this, I am not generally a consumer of music downloads.  As a first experience with this, it was great!"
Amazon,"Not bad, but could be a lot better.",Diego Diaz,19-Oct-14,2,"A bit dissapointed with Amazon music, especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members, even if it was all included, it still wouldnt be that good, They are missing a lot of amazing artists, Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
Amazon,Dope,NIX TIX,25-Feb-16,5,Dope
Amazon,One Star,wendy,31-Mar-17,1,This sucks!!! Getting no where trying to get this on my I phone !!!!
Amazon,can't sign in - galaxy note at&,E ...dorf,27-Mar-12,1,"I think this app would be great if I could sign in but I can't. Tried reinstalling, no luck. Tired different keyboards no luck. Can type in user name and password but nothing happens when I press enter and there is no sign in button. Please fix this"
Amazon,Amazon MP3,SadJack,25-Feb-13,4,"I buy a lot of my music from Amazon, so this app is perfect for downloading and syncing that music without any fuss. I don't use it as a player, because I don't play it off the ""cloud"" and I have a much better program for playing the music on my device."
Amazon,from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime,Jacob,13-Oct-14,2,Until i can find a way to hear more than 30 second snip's of songs on my phone this app gets 2 stars...from the PC it works great and is a great added bonus to prime.  I dropped my Pandora and will drop Goggle music once I figure out how to hear more of a song.
Amazon,Music Purchase Frustrating,Nic McLaughlin,16-Jan-17,1,I don't know why I have to install your music app to purchase music. Very frustrating.
Amazon,Use pandora instead,Joe K.,1-Jul-17,1,"This used to be a great app before they got money hungry. As it Prime member you used to be able to download a lot of music onto my phone and play it later to save data. But now they've updated it and I have to pay to be able to do that. They are taking way too many perks away from Prime members.  Even their movie app is not as good as it was, So now I just use Pandora.  If this keeps up I will drop my prime membership!"
Amazon,Simple but Helpful,Ben,13-Apr-13,4,"It's a nice app, but there's not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you're just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all, nothing bad to say."
Amazon,i did love it...,tara,2-Mar-13,1,"It was great on my droid, but won't stream on my LG. That's a big deal to me as I was using it all the time. Now if I want a song, I have to download it to my device in order to listen to it. Guess I need a new place to buy all my songs and that sucks."
Amazon,Won't work on android 4.1,Christopher,30-Mar-11,1,"Version 2.81 works fine, but the new version 3.06 only loads 1/2 of my music and then stops - all albums from N-Z do not load.  If you have a large collection (more than about 8,000 songs) - do not upgrade to this version!"
Amazon,Amazon MP3,Angie,7-Dec-12,1,"again we got this for my son to be able to get music on his android phone.  we have yet to be able to get it to work.  even though I have added his device to my account,  downloaded the app on the device.  it still says he is not authorized to use it."
Amazon,Five Stars,reader,31-Dec-16,5,a great app!
Amazon,Doesnt play,Michael Owen,31-Mar-11,1,"On DroidX running 2.2, most of my music tracks dont player, the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks...FOREVER. this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement. Those are my thoughts."
Amazon,bug report on keyboard detection,Luca,31-Mar-11,1,"Hello. The app is refusing to start because my keyboard has language ""English(Italy)"" since the phone was bought in Italy (I'm actually in the US).Could you just check that the language string starts with ""english""?"

Amazon,This was not what I order,Amazon Customer,17-Jun-14,3,I order a different plug that had a different connection. Because I was desperate to connect to a power source I use it. It worked so I settled. My complaint is with Amazon for sending the wrong item. The order numbers were similar but not the same.
Amazon,Especially love her Christmas album,AHZ,21-Jan-15,5,"I discovered Enya with this. Especially love her Christmas album, beautiful sounds! I have to load the albums or songs from ipad then they will play on the TV after I sync. Was a Godsend at Christmas! Kept the house peaceful with her voice! :)"
Amazon,wont work if your language setting isnt English US,Nomas,15-May-11,1,US resident with US Amazon.com account currently in America but my language setting is English UK and it will only allow me sign in to amazon.co.uk. just spent 36 hours uploading my music to amazon.com so I am upset.
Amazon,Looks like we won't be keeping the Prime account after all,Amazon Customer,18-Sep-14,1,"Unfortunately I have a windows phone so it doesn't work for me, and my husband has a Samsung Galaxy III that was made for the Canadian market so it won't load into his phone either!!! Looks like we won't be keeping the Prime account after all :("
Amazon,Does what it's supposed to do,mattgb1,10-Feb-13,3,"Amazon still hasn't worked out its cloud server interface as well as they should, and they utterly ignore the needs of people like me who want it to handle podcasts (which iTunes does do)"
Amazon,sucker price,Amazon Customer,16-Jul-15,3,"I was disappointed on the Super Wednesday prime day when they advertised a fish finder for a low price,  but when you opened it up it was more than 25 times the advertised price.Really gets your attention. .... but don't deliver."
Amazon,needs work,Edward Newman,13-Nov-15,1,This app needs a lot of work . It keeps adding a new device everytime I reset my Android  device.It sucks
Amazon,Update Destroyed Awesome App-  Moto Droid 2,techknowgeek,9-May-11,1,"I was using this app a LOT to listen to music but after updating recently, all it says is 'network error' or 'error playing song' on both 3G and WiFi connections. :'( I will change to 5 stars if it gets fixed"
Amazon,Downgraded to free service?,Kristian Barrett,10-Jun-11,1,I didn't know I had a premium plan when I signed up for the service to begin with.  Must have missed the memo.  I don't know how many people have only 250 songs.  Thanks Applezon.
Amazon,works,T. Beldham,16-Aug-11,5,"This is a pretty good application, I think that it could use a refresh here and there though.  -Otherwise, a good app"
Amazon,A Music Lover's app fave,Jay K,8-Oct-14,5,"I love this app. It is so easy to listen to either my cloud or what is on my computer with a simple click of the mouse. If you choose, you can also use music prime with this app. It works on my Android phone as well as on my computer."
Amazon,So So,B. Feely,13-Apr-13,3,"I really don't use this app.  I tend to get my music downloaded for way less through my computer and transfer it to my tablet.  I think if I used my tablet for music more often I might enjoy this app more, simply for it's convenience."
Amazon,Just ok,James A. Ellis,18-May-11,3,"My greatest beef with Amazon player is how limited the settings are on the player itself. I love crossfading between tracks. Get this feature and I'll make this my default player. Until then, not so much."
Amazon,I love to use this app,Kathy Smith,12-Oct-14,4,I love to use this app.  The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due.  I am not sure I can justify $99 for this privilege.  It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music.
Amazon,Five Stars,Poloriod17,20-Oct-14,5,So easy to use! Love it!
Amazon,Nope Nope Nope,D. Keener,2-May-15,1,"Because this seems to be a prerequisite to downloading music purchased from Amazon, I won't be purchasing music from A again. It's difficult to use. It's invasive. It requires the system's security settings to be lowered."
Amazon,Great addition to amazon prime,Demon Necron,23-Oct-14,5,Really great collection of music and it's organization only thing that I'd change is adding a feature close to Pandoras music mix to give you a saved playlist of music close and varying from the original added song or artist.
Amazon,great idea but Amazon needs to work out a few bugs.,Trey Stone,16-Jun-14,3,Love the included music.  Prime has even more value now.The App locks up on my mobile phone and the browser version has a few querks.
Amazon,Good app,Allison F Green,26-Jun-17,4,Good app
Amazon,NOT USEFUL AMAZON!,HeirloomCountryFarms,27-Oct-14,1,"Even with ""Prime"" you still have to pay for songs or albums!  You only get snippets of the music for free, then are required to purchase the individual song or album to hear it in it's entirety. NOT USEFUL AMAZON!"
Amazon,really buggy,Alison Gravley,17-Jul-11,3,I can't seem to get this thing to work consistently. It is always telling me to reinstall. Done it several times with no luck. On HTC EVO 4G. Any ideas on getting it to stop saying it has an error?

Amazon,Now I cant use any apps,Joaquim,28-May-14,1,"Says there is a login error and to try signing in again.  None of the ""fixes"" I found online worked.  It won't let me use any apps I purchased from Amazon until I login.  I'm never buying another app from Amazon."
Amazon,Love the new Prime feature,Gupta,18-Jun-14,5,Good operation so far. The search engine defaults to search every song in Amazon library which is a small inconvenience when searching for Prime music only. Also haven't figured out yet how to create my own playlists.
Amazon,"I like having the cloud storage, and don't use more of it than 5 GB",sallythetimid,20-Jun-11,4,"And I bought most music through amazon, anyway, since I dislike iTunes.  The streaming isn't great when moving between towers, so I downloaded the music.  Yay."
Amazon,Does not work for me...,EThomas,27-Oct-16,1,I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and this app loaded but would not install. I tried all the fixes and troubleshooting tips without result. I have other Amazon apps installed and working.
Amazon,works good,Sam,21-Jan-15,3,Works pretty good. I was a little annoyed that I had to download it from the Amazon app store instead of the Google play store on my one plus one phone. I also would like a little better method of browsing music

Amazon,Keeps my SD space free.,Donovan Jeska,17-May-11,4,"Not the greatest looking mp3 player around, but good enough.  Functions well, though network hiccups are common.  Fits a need till Google Music goes public."

Amazon,Easy lintening,frogman,28-Oct-14,5,Its great. I can pull up several bands that I had not heard in years to listen too. I have lots of CD's but the time it take to switch a dis is more than twice the time to switch on prime

Purchasing, downloading (and re-downloading, if you need to) are all simple. Playback is fairly simple, too.What will make this the best (it's not there yet; I am aware of the limitations):- adjustable bit rate streaming- enhanced flexibility in the player (playlists, tag editing, etc.)- purchase streaming-only version for a fraction of the cost (enable upgrade later)- mark previous purchases as purchased, and inaccessible for re-purchaseKeep up the great work!"

Now you have to buy the song blindly without knowing if this is the song you were looking for or pay $7.99 a month to join one of their memberships for music which is not why I use this app. Nearly all my music is on this app which means I can't uninstall. It's all about profit.  They want your money. Don't buy single songs every once in a while, no they want you to pay monthly for their services."

Amazon,Store on sd card...,Robert M.,17-Jun-14,4,"I've noticed a lot of negativity due to lack of sd storage. Yes, you can't natively download to an sd card, however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to an sd card. If you've ever used a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. It's just like moving files from one folder to another. Your music player apps will read mp3 files from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the settings in order to eliminate a step, but sometimes we need to do things on our own and use a little thinking to get there."

Amazon,Unimaginably bad.,MWR,7-Feb-16,1,"I got the app in December and got all my music organized, stored all on an SD card and playlists set up (which you can do only one song at a time), then shortly after it stopped reading most of the songs on the SD card. I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files. Make sense?"
Amazon,I almost walked away from this app but found the new update to be awesome.,Jack of all trades,28-Oct-14,4,You guys are listening.  However maybe I missed it but can you back up your playlists that are created on an android device?  If that is not already done that should be next.
Amazon,My favorite app,Julie Lattimer,4-Jan-17,5,Love my music and have put it all in Amazon music player; even my odd mix CD's. I enjoy the free radio and many free songs. I don't need any other music app. It does it all.
Amazon,Not as Stable as it Used to be,AL,28-Oct-16,5,The previous version of the app was much more stable. Ever since they revamped the interface and launched the Unlimited service I have had problems with the streaming part of the app. It pauses after a few songs (even on my wifi) if it doesn't outright crash. Running it on Android 7 on a Nexus 6P.
Amazon,Love these Sandals,btb65,23-May-15,4,"These are the cutest sandals I have seen and I had tried to order them last year but they were out-of-stock.  So I reordered this year.  They still are the cutest sandals and go with anything.  Unfortunately, I have a high instep and with the strap being so far up my foot, I could not wear them.Rather than return them, I plan to pass them on to my cousin.  Therefore the I rated them as a 4 for me when they are really a 5 star.  The size was exact and shipping was swift with arrival on time.  I'm just so disappointed that I can't wear these sandals."

The case requires you to unscrew 6 small screws in the front to use insert your phone.  It's not a standards size screw you would typically have a screwdriver for around the house.  Hence, it will require you to purchase a screwdriver somewhere just to use the product.  It also has no instructions and is a little heavier then expected."
Amazon,Five Stars,Al Sims,22-Mar-15,5,Excellent
Amazon,Expected better from Amazon...,Brian,13-May-15,1,"The interface is terribly confusing and incredibly difficult to navigate.  It's hard to figure out how to even get to your music.  It's a resource hog.  You can't control whether it downloads to your internal memory or SD card.  If a download of purchased tracks fails (which it usually does) the ""Download Failed"" message can't be dismissed from your notifications regardless of whether or not the app is running (since some process of it is ALWAYS running).  You have to reboot the phone in order to clear any stray items it leaves in your notifications.Just give us something that lets us download the tracks we purchased so we can use whatever player we want."

Doesn't make much sense.UPDATE6/20/2014 - When I first posted this, it was not available on the first generation Kindle Fire, however the I.T. people got right on it and now us original owners have the benefit of Prime Music.

Amazon,Finally went too far,User,1-Aug-12,1,"I'm a big Again fan in general. We have a kindle, three kindle fires and three Android phones in the family that heavily utilize Amazon apps. We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."

I used to tell my friends about it but now....not so much. Ever since the last update it randomly ""stutters"" when playing a song or stops competely. I can't get it to clear off my phone after I turn it off. It has also become a pain to navigate. Before this last update I would have given the app 5 stars. I hope that they fix what they screwed up. No longer a fan."

However, after getting into my car, realized it no longer works our even shows up on Android Auto. Not my typical experience with Amazon, so 3 stars for release quality control."
Amazon,Love the Service; The App is Limiting.,Darren Nelson,29-Sep-12,2,"I basically just use this app for shopping or downloading. The irritating issue with this app is that you cannot set the default download location. As a result, if you have limited internal storage, storage space for your music becomes an issue. It would be much easier to store the music on an external SD card with more space. There are many users complaining about this issue for over a year but nothing has been done. This can't be that complicated."

Amazon,"If its not broke, fix it until it is!!",C. Johnson,13-Jan-15,1,"I have been using the Amazon Music App on my Tablet pretty much since it became available.  I am a prime member and I downloaded tons of free free Prime music to my device to listen while at work and not connected to the internet.  This served me well for many months and while I knew my downloaded prime music could only be played via the Amazon Music App, this was not a problem for me since I carry my tablet pretty much everywhere I go.However just today I load up the Amazon Music App as I always do at work and I eventually discovered that the app was only playing music I already had (meaning songs I didn't download from Amazon).  I have my entire library on random so after the 20th track of very old music, I discovered that all the prime music I downloaded to my device was no longer in any of my playlists.  I verified that the mp3s themselves were still on my device (why wouldn't they be?), yet this stupid app no longer sees them when I'm offline.  Even albums I've purchased from Amazon no longer appear in this app.  I verified that the albums I downloaded was still available for prime members, (System of a Down, 311, Disturbed, etc), yet for some reason the app doesn't want to play them anymore unless I'm connected to the internet.If I connect to the internet, then viola!! all my downloaded content plays.  But think about this for a moment, what is the purpose of downloading for ""offline play"" if I can only play them when I'm online?  I don't know what changed but an app that worked so well is now broken and pretty much useless for what I use it for.  I'm not going to connect my tablet to my cellular network for the 8 - 10 hours I'm at work just because Amazon decided to break something.This is incredibly ridiculous, and the so called help videos on Amazon.com are about as useful as ____ on a bull, and the only somewhat useful suggestion of refreshing your music library doesn't work.  My only other option is to redownload all my music that I ALREADY did to get this to work again, but I might not even bother because in 6 months it will probably break again."
Amazon,From reasonably useful to completely worthless in one update,bigjase,24-May-16,1,"I like its customizable folders album and artist options, but it sucks up WAY too much data to be regularly useful.Update October 2016I finally got used to the process of uploading and customizing, and they changed the whole thing, preventing the organizing of folders, songs, albums as we would like.  Now it is virtually useless and unwieldy, with side bars expanding,  and extremely difficult to simply look through folders.This is absolutely terrible.  If I hadn't spent so much time putting stuff on to it, I would never use nor continue with it."

Amazon,Permission to what?,CyberYadda,13-Apr-15,2,"Ok, I don't have alot of experience with these sort off things. But I just got my update notice, and it scared the heck outta me. I had no idea that their permissions allowed them to have as much, if not more, access to do as much as I do on my phone-and other devices. Why do we have to allow them to, set up accts, delete accts, use all our google accts at will, change and delete apps and other data, and on and on... Am I a bit more of a dummy than I thought? Why on earth would they need people to agree to things I would let my own mother have access to? Well,  maybe mom... Lol If anyone can help me make sense of this, I could really use the eye opener. But I really can't see myself going for it... Shaking my head..."
Amazon,Won't work,Dj,20-Nov-16,1,Thought this was included with prime ..  won't even open.
Amazon,Worst GUI Ever!,anomefasullo,2-Dec-16,1,"I am very tech savvy and have used many types of media management apps and software. This is possibly the worst interface ever, especially on PC. It is slow, sluggish, and difficult to navigate. The screen is so cluttered, you can't find anything. When playing a playlist on a PC, you can't even read the song title."
Amazon,"High quality app/service, intuitive, really enjoying thus far",Chris Macc32,5-Sep-15,5,"I only recently started using the Prime Music app, & after uploading my own music (matched by Amazon) & finding some Prime music that I was happy to find is available (free w/ Prime), am very happy with Amazon Music thus far. I briefly tried Google Music, & two popular music streaming apps (Pandora, & Songza), and my Amazon Music experience has been infinitely better. I had a few technical questions initially (re: uploading my music, using PC & iPhone, etc.) that weren't addressed online, & support for Amazon Music was available right away, very knowledgeable & spot on (I now realize) as far as recommendations made.Now that I'm routinely playing music & adding or deleting individual songs from my library, etc., my impression is that more thought and planning went into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other options I've explored. It's very intuitive; graphics are very professional & consistent; it's very responsive (I've not (yet, anyway) experienced any lag or technical glitches); there's no annoying behavior by the app to aggressively ""encourage"" you to buy music unless you've expressed that interest; and - one feature I really appreciate - no ads (pop-up or otherwise). Quality of stream is excellent.My impression is that Amazon (wisely) realizes that this app nicely integrates with their business model, & complements their core mission; that is, if the app works well & people have a very nice experience, it becomes a very ""sticky"" service (i.e., enhances loyalty & overall impressions of Amazon, & encourages more people to join (or continue their membership with) Prime). In any event, they've done a very nice job designing & implementing this service (& accompanying app), & I'm really enjoying it."
Amazon,Good except for one issue,Nick Huschle,6-Mar-17,4,"Pros:-Okay music selection. Had a fair amount of music that I enjoy (mostly have metal/death metal added, no other genre)-Free with Prime Subscription-Offline listeningCons:-If you want a lot more to choose from, you need an additional subscription-Having lyrics up causes memory issues (tons of lag)  on my device after a short period of timeFinal thoughts: Extended music library shouldn't be something that costs extra. And if you insist on charging extra, mark down the price please. Overall, a nice app that does what it's supposed to."
Amazon,Awful,KELLY,5-Nov-16,1,Hardly any control over media. You can't even use it in the background or capture media while in other apps like Snapchat. Don't even bother purchasing from Amazon music anymore. Stick to iTunes. Thumbs way down.
Amazon,"What happened, Amazon?",BennyG,21-Apr-16,1,"Stopped the ability to play DL Prime content without verifying first, which isn't the point of offline playback. Offline recordings cached well with a data connection, but like I said in the first sentence this isn't the definition of Offline playback.Cleared cache, reinstalled, etc. to no avail. Guess I'm paying for Google Play again even though I already have paid for my Prime."
Amazon,Still sucks.,Michael Koch,15-Mar-17,1,"STILL stops randomly, even on downloaded songs. STILL crashes my computer. Music STILL suddenly becomes unavailable without warning. STILL have to pay for some songs, even with Prime & music subscription."
Amazon,What a rip off,jorge,29-Apr-17,1,I have to pay even more money to listen music? My prime membership isn't enough??
Amazon,Angry!!!,Doctor JAM,15-Nov-16,1,"I paid $100 for my fire TV and $50 for the game controller and Amazon issues and update that makes me hunt through nested menus for purchased music that was originally accessible from the home screen. Updates are supposed to make apps easier to use not harder with more fees. If I start seeing advertisements the app I'm gonna demand a refund for my fire TV. The best word to describe the Amazon music cloud is ""volatile"". I literally lost purchased music because Amazon stopped the album. Even uploaded music is subject to the volatility of Amazon's music market. If Amazon made a straight up media player app they would not have a problem. I download everything I buy because I can't trust Amazon to keep it for me."
Amazon,Worst Music Service I've Ever Seen,Microgrooves,30-Dec-16,1,"This service has been atrocious. Only iTunes is worse. Although iTunes can handle more than 40k songs...... I am a person who has a huge audio collection, and I own an echo, so I'm forced to use Amazon Music for my server to upload my music so I can listen to it on my echo's. This has been a cluster since I was in the beta.... every time they upgrade, it gets worse and worse. After this last update, when I open it, I get an error message that says there is no disk in the drive, and It wont go away, and Amazon Music locks up..... can't use it at all. I've uninstalled and re-installed, and it does the same. About six months ago I called in for support, and they said it could not handle over 40K songs, but I was only at 33K. Still they said it was due to high song amount. I pay amazon so that I'm supposed to be able to upload up to 250K songs. That is not even the worst. I have a compilation set with 4 albums, and Amazon made a different album for each song. It is fraught with issues all the way through, and I have been telling amazon for almost a year about these issues, and it just keeps getting worse. I hope they fix it someday, as I love the Echo... but can't stand this program."
Amazon,Only one small glitch.,Edwin,4-Apr-16,3,"This app has a fair amount of music. Amazon music unlimited does have a fair amount more, but it is a good selection for a free app (with a prime membership). There is a small glitch that causes the app to not play the song you selected at first when you change albums, but when you select it again it works. It has music stations and albums to download. All and all it is worth a download if you have a prime membership. If you do not have a prime membership I would use google play music, because it seems to have less glitches."
Amazon,Prime music is not included in prime membership?,golfer,7-May-17,1,So now we have to pay more for prime but lose the music? What a scam......PRIME IS DEAD. I will not pay for it again.

DOWNLOAD ALL???Drag to a list to download?  I WANT IT ALL OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT!!!Amazon music is the worst program I have EVER run into, and I have been in computers since 1972.  THE WORST I have ever run into!It appears that they want us to leave everything on the cloud, make play lists and stream it off the cloud.  The problem with that is that mostly I send it to my tablets and my phone, which I then listen to in my car or out in public.  The tablets only ever have an internet connection in my house.  My phone has to pay BIG BUCKS for data to stream music I already own.Streaming may work just fine sitting at my desk in my home over a broadband, but it just doesn't work AT ALL out in the world.  I need to download to my devices.  ALL OF THEM!  All my music.Let me repeat, AMAZON MUSIC is the WORST program I have EVER RUN INTO.  And I have run into some reaaaaaalllly bad crap.Sadly, Amazon doesn't care, nor do they read these comments, so this is just an exercise in expressing my frustration.Buying the music is dead simple, and I like to support the artists, and listen to the music I love.

Seeing that the hdx is no lonher available (or so I was told), I decided to try the HD 10, thinking it was gonna be better that the HDX. I couldn't be more wrong. The one thing I looked forward to was getting back into my music. Come to find out that the HD 10 doesn't allow you to purchase music to add to your collection. So now I'm forced to purchase music from my phone and sync it to my kindle. That's if I decide to keep.it. It already has one strike against..wait no, two strikes against them.Just found out that I can't even download the Amazon Music app into said Kindle, it said it was 'unavailable'...'Una..who? This gets better and better. A total waste. I feel for everyone who's experiencing this too. Both investments the kindle and the actual music is about to go 'Bye Bye'. I just know it!

I looked at the permissions,  but Amazon says nothing about this.  Ultimately,  I trust Norton over Amazon.  There is no GOOD reason for Amazon.com to access all of our SIM cards.  I did make a complaint to the developers for what it's worth.  This makes me reconsider renewing PRIME when it comes time.

I listen to my music while driving in my driving job, and this piece of garbage has become so un-user friendly! I can't keep messing with it while driving, it needs to work as it used to.

(Why provide the ""free"" service then? (Meaning, the service we already pay $105/year for, in our Amazon Prime membership? And why does the company gray out other songs in my playlist, saying ""this song is no longer available."" ??? A song out of copyright, and more than 70 years old? Really? I believe this is the lowest scummy sort of pressure to try to make customers switch to the paid service. Tell you what. I'm leaving Amazon Prime music and will be very happy paying whatever Spofity charges. I hear they have more songs anyway. Amazon has nothing by Led Zeppelin for example. This Amazon Prime Music is fatally flawed by the company's greed and stupidity."
Amazon,ALWAYS RUNNING!!!,Julio Cesar,6-Jan-14,1,"This app is a huge resource hog. It has a setting called ""refresh cloud library"" that runs EVERY 10 min whether you want it or not.  The setting does not give you the option to disable that check or even change the time interval.  Hate apps that don't let you control if/when they run and drain your battery."
Amazon,it's not entirely terrible. A few things I liked about it was ...,AmazonCustomer,5-Jan-16,2,"I was expecting a bit more from this app.Don't get me wrong though,it's not entirely terrible.A few things I liked about it was the addition of lyrics to some songs and how simple it was to look for music and buy an artist's album. However,I did experience some issues.The fact that when I was listening to a song and lost my internet connection, the song would start all over and you're forced to listen to the entire song all  again once connection has been restored.Another thing I disliked about Prime Music was the fact that there's not many artists.Only really known ones.One of the things that really bugged me a bit was the fact that the app needed a lot of my private information.Like no thank you.I ended up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it took up a lot of space on my phone.I'd rather stick to Pandora."
Amazon,Getting better with age,J. Lubliner,16-Sep-16,5,I've been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it.  One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating.  The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists  that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library.  Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers.  It is truly a great value added service.
Amazon,Not worth another subscription,Grumpy Grandpa,16-Jun-16,1,"Did not care for the requirement to buy a separate subscription. We have Amazon Prime on my wife's phone and shared to my phone. I wanted to add music to my phone as I am the only driver and it would be nice to have ""our"" music to play from the phone through our car's enfotainment system. The attempted setup of a library for music required that I pay for another subscription. Definitely not worth another $99. Cannot say how the service works. Unhappy"
Amazon,Worse than that,anonymous,30-Nov-14,1,"Your app is very limited that sometimes it gets close to absurdity.1.  I expended over a $100 in your store to get a 128GB memory card.  I have not taken advantage of it because your app doesnÛªt allow specifying in which folder I want the music to be downloaded.  I have to maneuver and keep transferring the music manually which is really aggravating.  At times, if I have no done a recent transfer to the memory card and I will not be at home in a while, IÛªm in such need of memory that I have to clear the whole Amazon music from my phone.  The start the whole process again.2. To free up memory from my device, I selected the voicemails messages to be downloaded to the memory card.  Your app makes them part of the library.  Worse than that, I canÛªt delete them all at once or better,  just  delete them from the library but keep them stored in my phone.  At times I had deleted over 20 voice mails one by one from the app library.  That how stupid it becomes.3. Same as #2, I have downloaded complete playlists from Prime.  I discover songs that I donÛªt like and I donÛªt know how to get rid of them while keeping the rest of the library intact.4.  I can't play my music offline and wasting my cell phone data streaming.  When I try to play music supposedly downloaded to my cellphone, I get an error message with a ""Exception #180"" codeIt is such a painful waste of time when you can solve that in less than an hour.  That is why you hire software engineers and geeks.  Any of them can take care of all of the above during lunch time."
Amazon,An Audiophile's Nightmare,fae,11-May-16,1,"As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music.  Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn't work."
Amazon,Could use some editing,M. L. Hardman,20-May-16,1,"I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service  providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it."
Amazon,Luv Everything Amazon,Beth E.,5-Aug-15,5,"This app takes a minute to work through the intricacies but that's bc it does SO MUCH!  I wanna address 2 complaints I read abt 'no external SD support.' & that it limits u to 500 songs per playlist & that made the app a piece of crap.  Okay, so 1st off, 500 songs is like 3 Days worth of music.  I have a playlist with 48 songs = 5 hrs of music.  Does anyone's phone even hold a charge for 3 days straight??  if u streamed that much media on your phne straight the battery would heat up so hot & prbly melt the phne. So, to me that's a useless comment & irrelevant.  The other issue: I like that all the music us stored in the Cloud & it doesn't use ANY Storage space on my device.  If u own the music u can download to ur device  (it's fast!) to play offline if u ever get stuck or just don't want to use data.  And, YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDERS 2 an external SD card if u have an Android (Samsung S5 user here).  it works just like moving files on a computer. The hitch is this:  u can download aNY of the music u want.  However, u can only move the music you own.  Amazon streams the music in 2 different formats: MP3 & MP4. It downloads in MP3 if u own it. Then u can move to an SD card & the app will find it & play it.  MP4 music has to stay with the app on the phones internal storage.  Hopefully,  most ppl get the obtuse reasons for this, so you can't transfer & steal music u haven't purchased.I personally think this is a great app & that Amazon Prime is better than sliced bread. I'm a true believer."
Amazon,Now trash app like others before it.,Amazon Customer,13-Sep-17,1,"As of the latest 7.1.2 version this stand alone app records audio without permission and no way to turn it off.  I have no use at all for this ""feature"".  This is not an Alexa, tap, or even a Kindle app, this is on the Android version used on phones. No choice for consumers means no value to consumer. Time to move on and find a better player that let's me choose how I consume my media. Last two updates have had spotty connection. This was last nail in the coffin."
Amazon,Amazon Music,Debbie Baer,8-Jun-17,4,Use this app almost daily.  Love that we can create our own stations to listen to.  Totally like there are no commercials to listen to.  But there are 2 complaints I have though.  If you put a song in twice by mistake it won't let you delete one of them unless it deletes both from the app.  There needs to be a way to just delete a copy.  Also when I travel I may be listening to directions and turn it off .  As soon as I restart my car starts it comes on /  even if I don't turn it on.  And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on.  There is just a glitch were it comes on without turning it on that could be fixed.  But I love the music and so do my grandchildren.  We all have our favorite stations.  Highly recommend this Amazon App!
Amazon,App almost tolerable; Incompetent Music Unlimited Support,Amazon Customer,18-Sep-17,3,"Numerous issues with this app. Music not playing (with errors), including music that ""I Own"". Creates duplicate offline playlists EVERY time you download music to device. Very inconsistent loudness levels across albums / artists. Limited features when connected to modern vehicle entertainment systems compared to competitive music streaming services. And, I'm a Music Unlimited subscriber!Amazon Support virtually useless. It's a vicious, yet ""very polite"" circle of getting absolutely NOTHING done. I've sent app logs so many times I can click through my phone blindly in a matter of seconds. Amazon Support has yet to act or provide a ""we found a problem"" response.Send logs; Provide more info; Thank you, now please call us; Thanks for the call, please provide more written information; Sorry for these problems, please send us your log files --- then REPEAT Indefinitely.Over 4-weeks of this and no solutions. One of the support engineers I spoke to also  experiences similar issues with the app, so why are these issues not addressed / corrected?"
Amazon,the latest build broke app,Amazon Customer,7-Dec-13,1,"used to be a terrific app, but the latest build has made it remarkably useless.  i see the new update comes with the ability to share what i'm listening to facebook.  thanks, but no thanks.  i don't need or want people to see what i'm listening to.  what i want is the old player whose widget worked and that didn't lag when playing from the cloud."
Amazon,Deletes playlists,Mid Century,8-Jun-16,3,"I've been a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appeared. And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I'm not going to risk testing it either since I'm talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof!  The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century.  The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn't it?Reminds me of when ms quit selling music, their player crapped out and amz stepped in."
Amazon,Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of ...,Debbie,5-Mar-15,1,"Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of downloaded prime music to an SD card, or it purposefully prevents such transfers. While the latter is more egregious, both are unforgivable.  A few lines of simple coding (if that) would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that Amazon is working to do that. Are you? Hint to Amazon: ""free"" prime music is not free. Your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege. Second hint: even if the music is transferred to an SD card, which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device, Amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account, so what does it matter? For your (tens of) thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory, this is a huge problem. We are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your ""cloud"" to listen to our prime music. Fix this glaring problem and this review goes to five stars, because the ease of downloading prime music and the sound quality are impressive. Thanks."
Amazon,"Good, but Amazon Prime Music has a lot of adapting to attract Millennials and stay ahead of other streaming music options.",heavenlywhisprz,16-Mar-16,3,"For the most part I am enjoying Prime music--both my library and streaming. Prior to Amazon Prime Music, I mainly used Pandora and Spotify. It is quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music caters to the white, middle-class, mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. As a millennial I am definitely more drawn to Spotifiy's playlists and classifications for genres.  I have a feeling I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1-year subscription. However, I was turned off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon caters.So far, I am thoroughly enjoying no ads and the option to download playlists, albums, and songs to my library to listen to offline. That is a big deal for me since I have a small data plan and limited access to Wifi. I'm definitely willing to tryout as much as I can on Prime during my first year of paid access. At this point in time as a business woman and a graduate student, I feel that the $50/year student membership fee is not worth it and most definitely not the regular membership fee."
Amazon,This was a good app but the past few months i have not ...,Carlos B. Lara,21-Oct-16,1,This was a good app but the past few months i have not been able to update it. I unistalled it and tried reinstalling it. Keep getting a error 505. Have the samsung s6 edge and still have trouble with this app. This is the only one i have problems with. Hope they get it fixed soon or ill be downloading another music app.
Amazon,Bug ridden release!,Bhatta's Reviews,14-Jun-14,2,"I was very excited when I learnt that Amazon has decided to allow streaming of most of the popular music for Prime Members like me but my excitement did not last very long when I found several bugs & limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. Granted it is too early to comment as the app is new but certain basic concepts are flawed.The most important for any phone or tablet is the limited space one has for storing music files and since this app saves music for offline listening into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it (External SD card) it is very limited on how many songs you can save on the limited internal storage.It is never practical to be connected to Wi-Fi at all times on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage, it is also not practical to stream using your data plan all day so currently the app is flawed. I am sure eventually Amazon will release updates to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablets.Also, there are number of bugs and more notably the app gives a lot of exception errors and asks to contact customer  service and the downloaded songs do not play. Even killing the app and restarting does not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re-download the songs till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounters download errors (Which it does on a regular basis) you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re-download again or try again and again which is very frustrating.Also the album art goes out of sync when shuffling. The Song title does not match with the song it is playing, The album art disappears when you are not online on certain songs, the Equalizer does not seem to have no effect and the list of bugs goes on...It is indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited streaming of popular songs to Prime Members but this APP should have been the first thing they must have paid more attention and get it right as all that effort that they have put into cloud services for streaming music is worthless without a proper working APP.I am rating this with 2 stars currently but I am positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly.Thanks for reading my review."
Amazon,"If you want the best app ever, and have the $$ for it, find something else.  ""Prime music "" is actually so so.",A_publicname,11-Nov-17,2,"The Amazon music app is okay.  I use it almost everyday.  I'm content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can't listen to.There have been a few errors with the program I've experienced.  But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music.  Somedays I'll hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes.  I click on the app.  And I wait a moment.  Then some more moments...and it's still loading.So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving.  It couldn't take that long could it?Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so.  Other times- 15 minutes down the road-  The screen still hasn't popped up.Usually.  After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.Anyhow.  I'll likely keep using it.  I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.It's not convenient.  I don't like it.  But it'll do."
Amazon,"Incapable of storing music on SD card, which is idiotic",Huns,17-Jan-14,1,"This app insists on putting all your music on the phone's internal storage. There is no way to move it to the SD card. Therefore, the amount of music you can have with you is bound by the unchangeable internal memory rather than an SD card which can be 32GB or larger.This problem has been known for YEARS. The developers have deliberately ignored it. They simply don't care about how useless this idiotic, pointless restriction makes the app.Amazon is pretty good at a lot of things, but when it comes to this app, it's amateur hour."
Amazon,Terrible Service,Alice Ceballos,2-Jun-17,2,It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there . For a subscription service that is included with prime it should have a much larger database of music to choose from . I can download music to my phone or use Pandora with so much more ease and not get a headache
Amazon,Streaming works great. Downloading doesn't work at all.,Nathan,2-Apr-14,1,"I've been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it (so I can put it in the car), and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I'm now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which shouldn't even be necessary in the first place, wouldn't be able to do its job. It's not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you'll end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50% of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been ""01. Track Name.mp3"" would end up just being called ""01. Track N"", with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I'm not paying for bandwidth.It's difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they'll give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."
Amazon,Make the app self report errors...,Steven H,1-Dec-15,2,While I love the music the app on my Samsung Note 3 is terrible.  It fails repeatedly.  It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service.  Why does the app not send this report itself?  Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again.  Today I was just trying to edit a playlist.  I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start.  I don't want to call customer service.  Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?
Amazon,I feel prime just made things worse for this app,C. Senn,19-Jun-14,2,"I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?*In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.Pros:Not laggy and no bugs yetFree MusicGreat launch for PrimePop music for the masses.Cons:Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your tasteUI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clickingadd/delete songs from playlists is confusing"
Amazon,There are better apps out there,Christina,27-Sep-14,1,"This app is an absolute mess.  If and when it works properly, it will only work that way for a short period of time.  For those who were familiar with Amazon's previous mp3 app (which worked great), this an ""upgraded"" version of that app that's just completely missed the mark.I will give the one positive of this app is that you can quickly move between device and cloud.  So if you have created playlists or Amazon Prime playlists, you can easily get those.  That's really where my enthusiasm for this app ends.My current issues with this app:- Freezing - This app freezes constantly.  I listen to music each morning/afternoon as I ride the train to and from work.  Each time I boot up the app, it will be at my last play point, freeze, give me the stopped working message, and then reboot again always at the Cloud/Albums page.- Unresponsive Controls - It happens fairly often where I will hit the skip button and nothing happens.  It's actually more like I hit it 12 times before I give up.  Finally when I accept that I can't skip a song the app catches up and quickly skips past 12 songs.- Unresponsive Quick Bar - When in the Songs screen, the quick bar that allows you to move between different letters will be touch and go if it works.  And it never fails, it always stops working when I'm on a song with the letter A and decide a song with the letter T would be better.- Playlists that don't shuffle or shuffle when they feel like it.- Always have to choose repeat and shuffle.  Sometimes, you just know the song you want to start with.  Every time I hand pick a song I always have to re-choose repeat and shuffle, or it will just start going in order.  The previous Amazon mp3 player always remembered my selection.I will admit most of my complaints are, when isolated, an annoyance.  But those annoyances occur daily and add up fast.  The only reason I continue to use this app is because I've invested a lot into Prime and Prime Music.  I will admit, Amazon has me over a barrel on this one.If you don't have a huge investment in Prime Music and you're just looking for a music app, definitely look elsewhere.If improvements and fixes are made to the app, I will come back and update my review."
Amazon,"Great music service, DIG IT",Shane Perry,8-Aug-15,5,"As a Prime member we always try and explore new music. Initially there was a bit of a curve to sort it all out. But as with all Amazon products, interact and select the suggestions as well as various a ratios station's and samples. Amazon-Amazing analytical tools as well as their buyers and Brand merchants  will  soon learn your likes and open new worlds."
Amazon,Pretty good!,Ali Julia,30-Jul-17,4,"Nice app. Easy to use, no ads. Good value if you are a prime member. Streaming, off line, individual songs, stations, thumbs up/thumbs down. It has per-existing play lists or you can create your own.Minuses? Not many. I wish it would remember the station I was listening to and return to it after I turn it off and then turn it back on again.Ali Julia review"
Amazon,Disappointment for Prime Members,NP,6-Aug-17,1,Someone told me if I had Amazon Prime I could stream music using my account...in the end the truth is I was assaulted by repeated offers to pay more money to join music unlimited and could not play anything that I had not already purchased. What a disappointment.
Amazon,Can't figure out how to play songs while offline,Amazon Customer,13-Jun-14,1,"I only want certain songs downloaded to my kids' devices and I don't want them to be able to purchase music.  With the previous version, I could log in on their device, download the song they wanted, and then log out.  They could easily find and play their songs.  After the most recent update, I can't figure out how to get to their songs without being logged in.  When you open the app, it prompts you to log in before you can do anything.  I tried just finding their music and playing it through android's music player, but amazon songs don't show up as music.  I was able to dig around and find them, but it was a hassle.  I can choose the amazon player to play each song individually, but the other functions don't seem to work.  I have to go through the file system for each song.  At least once I did that, my device recognized the files as music so I can use the android music player.  UGH."
Amazon,Not so good after the upgrade to new service,Frank Gutierrez,15-Nov-16,3,"Same old music, just different station names. Since the new update, it no longer connects to my Ford Sync, just bluetooth audio. The push to get people to pay for this service leaves the music that is provided to Prime members very lacking. Don't try to force me me to pay more money, I promise you I won't pay, I'll just leave you, there are plenty of other services out there."
Amazon,You just lost a customer!,Deena Nelson,1-Jul-14,1,Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I didn't have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I'm not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again.  Bad move Amazon!  I won't use iTunes so now I'm in search of a different provider.  great job - you just lost a customer.
Amazon,Barely functional,Jennifer Gundlach,27-Sep-15,1,"This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo."
Amazon,"let's you DL your music directly to MicroSD; still no gapless play or equalizer, still needs major work",cinephiliagal,7-Jan-16,2,"Finally this lousy app allows you to download the music YOU OWN directly to your MicroSD card, which I understand was a problem with Android, not Amazon (the problem occurred with many other non-Amazon apps).That being said... this app still needs major work.DLs of music I bought/own don't always work, but there's no indication from the app that they didn't complete. So you think you have the whole song, and instead you have only half or less.On top of that, it is SUCH A PAIN to try to delete and reDL the song, because this must be done from completely different screens and requires stepping back through multiple menus. It is neither easy nor intuitive.As a Prime user, I'm allowed to DL some Prime music I *don't* own for offline listening. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't. The app won't tell you why.There's no way to remove the gaps between songs the way they would sound if playing a CD or album. There are FREE apps that let you do this or let you crossfade, which this app also doesn't let you do.There's NO graphic equalizer. Again, there are free music player apps that do this!"
Amazon,Great music app!,Robert Stier,12-Aug-16,5,"Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet."
Amazon,"Great concept, but essentially unusable in practice!",Charles P. Lotz,7-Jul-14,1,"I am a huge fan and used of Amazon Prime- originally for the 2 day shipping and for the last year+ for streaming video. When the price jumped 25%, the general consensus was that Amazon would be adding another killer benefit to make up for it- and so it was when Amazon Prime Music was announced. I loaded up on albums I hadn't listened to in years, and marveled at the bargain that Amazon Prime represents.My daughter just got a new Android phone- a brand new, very recent model, relatively capable Android phone, with a brand new 16GB SD card (purchased via Amazon Prime!) installed. Amazon Prime Music was the second application loaded onto it- in fact it was a and she sat on the couch, delightedly perusing all the music she now had available.A few hours later the phone was staggering, and a quick check revealed the culprit- the internal memory was almost entirely occupied by Amazon Prime Music's data. Thinking that it ws just a matter of directing the data to the still empty SD card, I first perused the settings and then did some internet research revealed that this is not an option- the app only write to the internal memory. The 'Clear Cache' option helped for the short term, but the fundamental problem remains.It is a pity- this has the potential to be huge part of the cost-benefit calculation in favor of Amazon Prime. Instead, the benefit is essentially nullified, and one is let only with the (increased) cost."
Amazon,Love Amazon,Rick,16-Oct-16,5,I really enjoy the music that has lyrics included.  Now we wish every possible song in there would include the lyrics.  Thanks!
Amazon,Best app ever!!!,Morgan,22-Sep-15,5,I love Amazon and I love love Amazon prime music. I feel like there is actually another person on the other end who knows all the music I love and they just pick the best songs all day!!!it's crazy to find a Mac dre station. I also heard on the news recently that Amazon has spent around 100 million on letting their prime members stream music and movies add free and I just want to say thank you Amazon for being legit! I love this company and everything about it.
Amazon,garbage,Cal,8-Sep-15,1,"This app is difficult to use and fails often. I have never used an app that made it this difficult to play music. It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it isn't user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more."
Amazon,No Download Location Setting,Tink,18-Aug-13,1,"Well, when looking for an alternative to Google Play, I thought for sure that Amazon would have their head on straight and would allow you to choose where the downloaded music is stored so that the memory limited main phone storage, which cannot hold my music collection, would not be crunched.  Unfortunately, Amazon has it WRONG as well.  There is no setting to choose the download location, thus the poor ranking of this application."
Amazon,Poor experience with the amazon music software (5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400) for Windows,Phenomenon,6-Nov-16,1,"Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!"
Amazon,Amazon is stealing my music!,Karen,5-Jul-14,1,Disappointed is not even close.  Amazon prime is cherry picking songs from previously downloaded albums and refusing to let me access this purchased music unless I pay more money!
Amazon,How stupid is that,Paul Timos,1-Dec-16,1,"Amazon needs to make some major improvements to their Amazon Music App on the Kindle Fire series.  It does not work well offline (appears the buffer memory is way too small).  Besides not working well offline, you have to actually tell the Kindle Fire device to work offline and then tell it again to work online... How stupid is that?  Can't Amazon's own app on it's own name brand device figure out if it is connected to WiFi or not and function accordingly?  I love the Amazon Music service concept, but the Amazon Music App currently is so sub-par.  In addition, when the Amazon Music App crashes, you literally have to reboot by turning off the Fire and then turning it back on again.  On both my Apple and other Android-based devices, in the rare instance that an app does crash, you can wait a few seconds and then just re-launch it.  Not so with Amazon Music.  To shame!Also, it appears that the Amazon Music App has functionality issues with reading/writing music files on large memory cards.  I have had Amazon Music crash and then my Fire HD 8 suddenly can't read my name-brand 64GB SDHC card after the Amazon Music App crashed.  I've had this behavior happen many times... Then it takes a series of reboots to get it to properly read the memory card (and apps loaded on it which are all grayed out on the screen) again.  And then the Fire HD 8 and all apps and media on the memory card will work just fine for days, usually as long as Amazon Music App doesn't crash out again!!!  So that tells me it's not a bad memory card at all... Somethings wrong with Amazon's app / device.Overall, the Fire HD 8 Tablet seems to be an excellent low-priced tablet, but the Amazon Music App and phantom memory card error issues are killing it for me.  Amazon, you're better than this, right?  Get your device and app teams to fix this or I'm moving to Spotify and likely never coming back!"
Amazon,"If this gets better, maybe it can rise to mediocre.",Bob Powers,24-Feb-16,1,"Mediocre at best.  The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information.  You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you?  Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5?  You realize that station is not for you.But.  The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck!  Horrible!A simple description under each station is too much to ask?  Or even just a category label?  No?  As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?I'd love to learn about new artists--  but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).Where is a FILTER for the prime stations?  I don't care what is popular!  I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.One star, all but useless."
Amazon,No External SD Support = Useless,virtuadept,24-May-13,1,"This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone. The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store all of its data. All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache, and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone (depending on other apps you have) before you will fill up an S3. Streaming is fine, but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small (these days) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap. Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally, but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon's MP3 cloud progam. So yeah, it's useless. Deleted app, canceling cloud subscription, will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD's or whatever, if they can't make it convenient, then what good is it, really?"
Amazon,Not a robust Music source,Danny Fixit,10-Dec-16,2,"Several issues with this software/service.  It does not work on Roku yet except to access my purchased music.  Can't find other music or playlists.  Then on my BLU Advance 5 phone (Android) from Amazon, the app hogs itself into the main memory of the phone and will not move to the added SD card.  As a result (like other Amazon apps), they all take up so much memory in a limited memory phone that it makes it impossible to use.Overall, on other platforms, I don't find it as versatile as Pandora in finding music, building playlists, or creating ""stations"" of my own.  At this stage, I am staying on Pandora."
Amazon,Wanted this to be good.,Kevin,16-Nov-14,1,"I wanted this app to be good since I'm a prime member.  I could get over the clunky gui, but the app won't play more then one song off a playlist or album. This used to work fine but as updates have come it's gotten worse and worse. First it would only play five or six songs off a playlist/album. Now after the most recent update it will only play one then stop. The app will also crash every time I try to play a downloaded song. Really buggy and poorly written program. I expect much better from Amazon."
Amazon,Stupid app,Amazon Customer,20-Oct-16,1,Can't even login into it both Google play and in Amazon underground _Ùª
Amazon,Keeps closing,HogCc,13-Nov-16,1,The app keeps closing for no reason. It used to be a great app and always opened automatically when connected to Sync. Now it won't stay open. I have to keep switching back to FM while driving because Amazon Music closed. Please fix this!
Amazon,Worst music player,Eddie,9-Mar-17,1,"You buy music with this app, but you can't play it on any of your new devices. It's the worst. It doesn't let you play it because you have to deregister your old devices on Amazon.com from a web browser. But you have no way to register a new device. So Amazon Music will give an error called ""Ah fiddlesticks"" which means... awe, our music software can't play the music you paid for on your new smartphone.Oh and then, it says that you have to buy a Kindle or something like that in order to register your new device. What kind of non-sense is that?Asked a friend who tried Amazon Music once if it is even worth trying to register a device, and he said, ""Amazon Music has the worst possible audio software and makes your high quality mp3's sound very, very bad."""
Amazon,This app needs work...,B. Lawrence,25-Sep-17,2,"I have 2 major complaints about the Amazon Music Android app.1. When playing music ""OFF-line"" (from tracks that have already been downloaded to my device), playback frequently pauses, as if it's having a buffering problem similar to a streaming (ON-line) connection.  the interruptions to playback are incredibly annoying and don't happen on any other music player using the same device.2. There is no way to auto-play music on bluetooth connect.  When I start my car, I want my music to start playing as soon as BT connection is established.  The Amazon Music app does not support this feature.  I have tried using other apps (Bluetooth AutoStart and others) and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect, but I am not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... Well.. If I already have Amazon Music App running on the phone, it will transfer over to the car and keep playing, but, that's only if the Music app is already running.For example... Black Player music app will auto-play on bluetooth connect from a cold start.  Black Player doesn't need to be running.  It just recognizes the BT connection and starts playing the song that was last played when it was turned off.  This is the way a music app should work... of course you should have a setting to be able to turn off this feature if you don't want it...If Black Player can do it... why can't Amazon?"
Amazon,Mobile Android App Does Not Work As Advertised,Muggs,13-Sep-14,1,"Amazon Music with Prime Music for mobile devices is unusable.  Have contacted Amazon customer support for over a week and a half to no avail.  Amazon customer service reps try to help and are sympathetic, but the bottom line is the Amazon Music with Prime Music App for mobile android devices does not work.On the ""Cloud"" setting music cuts in and out.  Music downloaded to ""Device"" does not play at all.  The only music the app plays without error are songs that have been purchased.  It is strange that the music that has been paid for plays fine without cutting in and out, but the Prime Music in the ""Cloud"" and ""Device"" downloaded into the playlists do not.Nice try Amazon, hopefully the kinks get worked out.  Would like to see it play like the P.C. version."
Amazon,"I'm no grandma, and this is truly the most complicated way to download music I've encountered",Brigitte,22-Aug-13,1,"Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure ""oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!"". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than 20 new songs, I now have 200+ duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space."
Amazon,This software has turned into garbage.  Can't even download purchased music to my phone.,Larry Dare,19-Apr-16,1,"This software is getting more unpredictable on my Galaxy S5 as time goes on.  It will not allow me to put new purchases on my SD card on my phone.  I don't like having to stream music while out on my runs because it uses up my data from Verison.  When I do stream, it often changes to a different album on it's own.  I also like using Power Amp because it works predictably and the sound is much better.  Even the headset buttens in Amazon are unpredictable.  I have not been able to upload the last album to my phone.  Sometimes it will down 1 to 3 songs but will not download the entire album.  Your music software has turned to the worst software I have ever used on my phone.  Factory reset doesn't help.  ."
Amazon,Amazon Music - getting better but not quite great yet..,PV_Seattle,20-Apr-17,3,"So I am an unlimited Amazon Music subscriber and some pros/cons:Pros:1. Huge quantity of music to select from2. Family plan works for my whole family - thank you Amazon for finally making this available.3. Integrated with AlexaCons:1. Stations and playlists are not curated/updated.  Unlike Pandora or many other music services, the stations and playlists on Amazon are pretty much the same.  For instance - any time you start the Classical station, the first tune played is Yo Yo Ma - EVERY TIME..  Amazon really needs to step it up in the curation management of their stations.2. Variety of playlists and stations suck.  They have the generic genre stations and then they have stations by artist but there is no ability to select 3,4,5 artists and have the site dynamically create playlists/stations for you.  I miss this feature the most from Pandora and find myself going back on occasion (with commercials) just to find different music that is similar to the music I already like.  My kids use Spotify the majority of the time for this reason as well.I'm sure Amazon will eventually catch up but with all their resources, they are very slow to add them."
Amazon,Youve lost an MP3 customer,Michael J Deneen,5-Aug-14,1,"App will CONSTANTLY turn itself on and eats up LARGE amounts of data, sometimes entire GBs at a time if you don't pay attention. Since the update, I've yet to get an album to download without it failing, whether Im on wifi or 4G. Amazon employees are useless too, as all they say is to uninstall it and reinstall it, which does nothing.I will no longer be purchasing music via Amazon for Android."
Amazon,Wont Work on Older Hardware,Kindle Customer,27-Jun-14,1,"Great job. Promote your new prime music and make the player incompatible with older hardware (2 year old phone and first generation Kindle). It has speakers, it has a audio jack, Pandora, Slacker, everything else works on it. Guess I will say screw it to Amazon Prime Music and stick with tried and true music players that don't give me a hassle.Be warned, if you don't like spending several hundred dollars every year to upgrade your tech then you wont like this application because it wont like your perfectly good hardware. Way to be like Apple Amazon."
Amazon,This app is a mess.,Nathaniel Morey,20-Aug-17,1,"This app is constantly having loading issues, I download every song to a playlist for work and yet when I turn off my internet it will get to a few songs it can't seem to play anymore even though they say downloaded right there on the list, what gives?Not only that but just random songs will stop playing internet or not, and instead of skipping them the playlist will just sit loading endlessly, and it will be the same song every time for a week, then a different one, it's really annoying that I cant just open my music in another app on my phone this one is very often completely unusable."
Amazon,Excessive Battery Usage,Coffee Grounds,16-Jun-14,2,"After installing this app on a Samsung Galaxy S3, my battery power significantly decreased so much that my phone couldn't even make it through the work day. I uninstalled, the app, and my battery usage returned to normal.  So I installed a new battery in my phone and re-installed this app.  Again, battery power took a nosedive. And again, I uninstalled it.  I really would like to use this app, but it is doing something in the background that drains the battery."
Amazon,i enjoy the amazon music area that comes with my prime ...,stephanie scheliga / ATribeCalledFam,25-Oct-15,5,i enjoy the amazon music area that comes with my prime membership...it has such a wide selection and great mixes as well...i like to play around with this music area when cleaning the house and dancing with the kids...makes cleaning fun and i get my exercise at the same time...thanks so much fun...mom and family approved
Amazon,App Designed By Someone Who Has Never Used A Music App Before,George Vazquez,26-May-16,1,"I really want to love this app.  I really do.  Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.But this app is absolute garbage.  It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before.  Maybe it's my phone?  I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:1)  You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud.  That's pitiful.  Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing.  I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number.  Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs.  A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.2)  If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance.  In a year what will I be at?  Favorites 69?3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv?  With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.4)  This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3.  This app has never once played a playlist all the way through.  And it is INFURIATING.  What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?!  I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800.  But it doesn't.  It. Keeps. Restarting.  So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday.""  Google Play Music never once had this issue.I want to hear a playlist all the way through.  I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist.  And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before.  But the app is currently a broken mess."
Amazon,Amazon has dried up,Alicia E. Goolsby,21-Jun-17,1,Is there a way to overactive stars?  This coming from a long time Amazon devotee.  But they have fallen far from good graces.  Do not purchase music through Amazon music.  They are worse than Apple with their proprietary management of what they sell.  I had a presentation set up that incorporated music I had purchased through Amazon.  Now I am left to buy the music for a different source because the Amazon music app is no long supported on my non Amazon devices.  And mindless have become the worst devices on the marketBad move Amazon.  Yes I have a voice Nd I will use it to warn others of your bad dealings
Amazon,Well behind Apple Music app. Hoping improvements will come soon!,Steelerfan#1,7-Jun-17,3,"The app needs some improvement in order to make it more user friendly. It has a very generic setup. The biggest pain is getting your library move over from another service like Apple Music. It's not easy if you have playlist you want to keep in place without having to make new ones. Sorting is limited, very limited columns selections in your songs catagory (roughly 2 choices vs Apple Music has over 40 choices). It has a duplicate choice in advance settings, but there is no option(or a way) for the user to run a duplicate command like Apple Music. Preference tab is very limited as well. These things makes this service well behind Apple Music, but like any other service it can be improved. The one big advantage Amazon music has over Apple is price. Amazon does offer 2 months off for a full year subscriptions vs Apple which offers no discount which is why I decided to give Amazon a try."
Amazon,"AVOID.  Do not become dependent upon Prime Music, you'll be sorry",Bob,16-Jun-14,1,"UPDATE:  I now have the Galaxy S7.  And guess what?  This app is TERRIBLE.  The ""update"" causes my playlists to stop after every song.  It will not recognize my downloaded music library (4000 songs, and this app can't find ONE of them).  And tech support is non-existent.  I've reinstalled 3 times.  I've uninstalled the update twice.  I've refreshed about 10,000 times.  Nothing helps.  And I was stupid enough to upload my music to Amazon Cloud and build playlists from Prime Music.  I think Mr. Bezos should refocus on his company rather than the Post or space junk."
Amazon,"For a simple app, it is really not that good",L. Briner,17-May-14,2,"This app only does a few things, it's basically a music player with a built-in store. Being someone who uses Amazon Cloud Player, I expected this to work like a breeze but there are all kinds of problems.The main one is that across both this app and the Cloud Player, Amazon have a pathological problem with track ordering and identifying albums which has STILL not been fixed. Talk about keeping the main thing, the main thing, I can't imagine how they can't fix it. Uploading tracks from iTunes to Cloud Player lose their track ordering because some of them get the year and disc number and some don't. Album artwork that is taken from a completely different album even though the tracks I've uploaded all have the correct tagging. I thought this was perhaps a Cloud Player issue but......nope. This app seems to have the same problems. Take Presto, an album by Rush which I uploaded from iTunes. It broke like most albums did so I had to reset the tags in Cloud Player to make the track listings work and now they are correct. I recently bought a new phone and got this app, downloaded Presto from Cloud Player and....the app thinks it is two different albums so now if I want to play the whole album, I can't without creating a playlist. One of them is listed as Presto with the srtwork from Presto and has 3 songs on it and the other is also listed as Presto but with the artwork from Chronicles with the other 8 songs on it.How on earth have Amazon mucked this up so badly? They are supposed to be kings of online sales and probably sell a large percentage of the online music market but this is basic cock up 101. The fact it has not been fixed? Fail The fact that this occurs on two products? Fail The fact that it happens on the app even when the tracks are supposedly downloaded from Cloud Player which is setup correctly? Fail The fact you can't even force the music on the app to go to the correct place? Fail The fact that the app thinks that Presto by Rush and Presto by Rush are two different albums? Fail.Also, the tracks sometimes reset back to the beginning when playing.The only reason I don't move to another service is that iTunes and Google Music don't sound much better. There is NOTHING actually keeping me with Amazon other than that."
Amazon,I will download music and it still acts like it online music only,Joe Doe,22-Sep-16,1,"So buggy, i wouldn't use it if it didn't come with prime. I can't believe that amazon finds it acceptable. Music will often not load or the app will crash out mid session, if you make a playlist that has online and online music it can't play offline (just skip the online). I will download music and it still acts like it online music only. The app will turn on randomly and play music (happened once in a meeting which wasn't cool). In addition its painfully hard to exit the program on your phone, its like one of those bloatware apps that just wont go away once you opened it. It is easy to find free music or purchase music though and works on both iphones and androids. The iphone app seems to be less buggy then the android (no surprise)."
Amazon,I hate it :(,MrsSeniorChief,26-Oct-14,1,"It's cumbersome. It forces updates that don't automatically install on my system so I have to go in and download the entire thing again and install it in order for it to run properly (Windows 7 Ultimate). It doesn't allow me to choose where on my system I want to save the music, and it invaded my privacy before I could choose my preferences/settings by going through all the existing music files on my computer (most of which are NOT from Amazon) and making a playlist for me... While I like Amazon for a lot of other purchases, particularly Kindle books, I'm not buying music from Amazon anymore. Going back to iTunes."
Amazon,After the love has gone.....gotta find another player.,jtown9,5-Jun-17,1,"I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car.  Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold.  The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.  And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it.  What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."
Amazon,"Nice, but a few usability issues",Dave,28-Sep-17,3,"It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version.  Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list.  I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate.  The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own.  After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again.  After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed."
Amazon,Having the correct album covers matter!,Tom,1-Mar-15,1,"Why Amazon can't get album covers right is beyond me.  They use Gracenote.  So does Apple where I rip the CD.  Apple gets it right but when I upload to Amazon they can't get it right.  I have spent hours on hours trying to correct album covers.  Just gave up.  There is an easy solution.  Let me update the album cover on your website like Google Music does.  What I have learned is that if you adjust music titles or album names, you might get the right cover to show.  Also, having the right cover on the website does not mean that the right cover will show up on a Kindle Fire device.  Or, it might be wrong on the website, but will be right on the Kindle Fire.  Go figure.  They have until my subscription expires to fix this.  Too many other services that get it right to keep paying for this one.  Apple gets it right.  XBOX music gets it right.  Google gets it right.  When all three of these services don't, they let you fix it.  Amazon does not, you are stuck with what they give you."
Amazon,Don't Upgrade,Amazon Customer,23-Jun-17,1,"Nope, now they're forcing you into a pay to play.  With the app you can no longer just search for a song and BUY it.  You have to sign up for their new program and get a free month until you start paying.  Guess I'll just keep the older songs I purchased, and mix in Pandora."
Amazon,Prime is always getting better,J.Petro,17-Jul-15,5,"Prime membership makes this the perfect App for any mobile device, you can either download prime music to your device and for those who are worried about storage can always stream there music online and it's all included with the Prime membership. Lots of music to choose from and all free with your membership, if your song is not available free on prime  you can always find deals on entire albums or just buy the songs you like while saving you more money in the long run. Automatically sorts out your music and you can add whatever it is to your digital library. This is very easy to use and would highly recommend using this if you are a Prime Member why pay for another music service when you have already paid for a Prime Membership make the most of Prime."

Amazon,Versitle! and Convenient!!,tourbi,11-Mar-14,1,"Have on phone and tablet.  Love I can play from device or cloud. Downloads very easy to SD card with help from mover app.  I have play lists on each that work for the device I'm using. Love that purchases automatically added.  I am very happy with a great tool.....app. One request ...please add back the ability to add more play lists to currently playing.  Thank you.Update****** So unhappy, this had been a favorite app of almost all my apps, I now hate it with a purple passion.  Please please fix this.  I can no longer see what I have added or purchsed in my music loaded to my device.  There for, I just purchased a song and it take for ever, FOREVER to add it to playlists.  I use playlists all the time.  I would go to the play list, and to the purchsed and add the new songs, no can do now., or go to the purchased and the new song and add it to the playlists Now I can only do it through songs, albums, etc.  It takes forever and is no longer fun to do.  Music must be easy and fun, it is not about work, but bringing joy, happiness, relief, healing etc to my life, NOT STRESS.  Please Please make it fun and easy and stress free again, make it the best again, instead of the worst app I have. Thank you.  I am so sad to have had to write this. Was 5 stars, now 1.  Please let me put it back up to 5 stars."
Amazon,"As of this moment, the worst music app in the history of music apps.",Heather Wolf,18-Nov-16,1,"I used to love this app (when it was still an orange icon).  The latest update ruined what was better than iTunes.  I have this on my iPhone because I used to like it better than iTunes.  It was much easier to navigate while driving.  The latest update ruined that.  It is now so complicated and counter-intuitive that I can't even really use it while I'm driving.  Since I spend about 20-30 hours on the road every week, that's a problem.This latest update didn't even fix what has been the biggest problem with the app since I have used it.  It treats compilation albums as though each artist is a separate albums.  So instead of one Christmas album with 14 songs, in the albums list, you have 14 albums, each one song in length because of the different artists.  Ridiculous!Other issues I have had since the update include losing individual songs from albums that were uploaded from CDs.  Jumper from my Third Eye Blind album just vanished from the middle of the album.  No other songs, just the one song. Go figure.  What's worse, is that albums that I purchased from Amazon disappeared altogether.  For example, I had purchased the full version of Maroon 5 (the Animals album) along with the lyrics book.  Since there is a ""Prime"" version of this, all of a sudden, I had the prime version with no lyrics book.  I was able to re-download the version I had purchased but it still sucked to discover that on a three hour drive and no time to pull over and figure out what the hell was going on.  Because it was the prime version, it wasn't in my normal list of offline albums.  So initially it looked like it vanished altogether.The controls are my biggest issue with this new update.  What used to be simple, straight forward controls are now ""fancied up"" to the point where they are almost as dangerous as texting to try to used while driving, especially trying to switch between albums.  The menu defaults to settings instead of just sticking to my offline albums list.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I just clicked the app to double check what I am saying here and all of my albums are gone.  Literally all of my music, except, oddly the one song that I have purchased from iTunes recently.  THAT song is still there.  Everything else is literally wiped out.  I'm done.  I'm going back to iTunes.  Amazon, someone needs to be fired for overthinking, over-engineering and just throwing a bunch of bells and whistles at this app, instead of fixing the actual problems with it."
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music - I use it because it's free and without commercials otherwise I wouldn't bother.,BenBTizMe,23-Aug-17,2,"I get the ""Prime"" version with my prime account for free otherwise I wouldn't use it.  The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible.  My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service.  Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent.  Amazon Prime Music - not even close.  Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts.  I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available."
Amazon,Cool App,Madison T. Edwards,16-Dec-15,5,"I've used several different streaming music apps.  Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.I like it!  It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever.  I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels.  Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora.  Other than that, I like this app,  I can pause, skip and shuffle.  It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."

Amazon,... Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon ...,Samantha Harper,2-Jan-17,2,"The entire reason I even bothered trying Amazon Music was because I thought it would offer a better user experience for seamlessly playing music with the Amazon Echo that my husband and I were gifted. My husband signed up for a 30-day Amazon Music trial to try it out with the intention of purchasing the $14.99/month family plan. Magically, 7 days into his trial, he was getting notifications saying his trial was up when attempting to play music. We had barely even had an opportunity to use it. Looked in the box that came with my Amazon Echo and found a 3-month credit for Amazon Music. Great! Applied it to my account and within a few minutes we were back to streaming music. Wasn't getting the best song or artist suggestions that I had seen with other services like Pandora and Spotify so I attempted to log in to Amazon Music on my laptop to organize playlists and was met with a screen offering a 30-day music trial AGAIN. Exhausted with the Echo streaming experience, tried Amazon Music on my Android device and even after verifying that I was signed-in on my account correctly, it acts like I don't have a 3 month credit so we weren't able to stream music while driving. Overall, pretty inconsistent user experience and much more trouble than it should have been to simply stream music. ""Credits"" don't seem to be true gift cards or credits so I would avoid that. Had in-laws in-town during the few days we had the trial and they said it made it seem like both Amazon Music and the Echo weren't worth their cost. Wouldn't recommend it to friends. Giving it 2 stars because it could at least play the majority of specific songs or artists that I requested but then again, other music services have had this figured out for years. I'll be sticking with Pandora."
Amazon,Serious Flaw in App,Stephen P. Cseplo,12-Jun-14,1,"OK, so i downloaded/installed this app on my Android Samsung S3 and it seemed to work fine. Played music, had all my purchases there, etc. All was good until I wanted to exit the app to avoid it running in the background and thus run my battery down and who knows what else in this day of NSA spying.I tried e-mailing customer service and got no help. I did call and did get to speak with a rep who informed me there is no exit button in quick fashion. Thanks, that answered my question. That is all I wanted.The whole thing is that every other music app I have on the phone has an ""Exit"" button available in it's menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? Better believe it does. Free Radio? Sure does, though it can be a bit clunky at times. Heck, even Anime Radio has an ""Exit"" button that shuts down the app.But this app? Nope!That is a serious flaw. Caused me to get rid of the app. It took using the Unistall menu option rather than just dragging it to the trash can, but at least it is now gone.And good riddance.If they ever get their act together and put in an exit button, I'll reinstall it.Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very well, namely selling stuff and forget services.This one sucks due to the one fatal flaw."
Amazon,"Best part of Prime, next to the free shipping",GlossyChic,11-Aug-15,5,"This is one of my favorite benefits of Prime!No extra cost to stream music from all genres commercial free. I listen on my laptop, kindle, and phone with perfect back to back flow, no issues of any kind. There are so many free choices available, that my playlist is pretty much neverending!Great free choices, great service!"
Amazon,I had switched from Spotify to Amazon music because Amazon had a few songs that Spotify doesn't and the music sounds a bit bette,Tom Paulk,15-Jan-17,1,"The last straw.  I had switched from Spotify to Amazon music because Amazon had a few songs that Spotify doesn't and the music sounds a bit better from the Amazon app in my opinion.  I am giving this app a one star rating for two reasons below and after submitting this review will be unsubscribing from Amazon music.1) This app constantly restarts in the background and drains the battery on my phone.  I have had to install a separate app just to put it into hibernation2) A bug seems to have been introduced recently where despite there being 70 songs in my playlist, the app insists on repeating the same song endlessly.  Selecting skip only returns to the songs beginning.  The only way to get a new song is to manually select it.  Not something I feel inclined to do- especially since I only used this app during workouts."
Amazon,The latest release of the best 50 Beatles hits is terrible because the sound engineers ...,Dr. R. R. Hilton,25-Dec-15,5,"I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles'  Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon  Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality,  but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control.  I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I don't understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault.  Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV.  Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities.  I have also revised my star  rating accordingly."
Amazon,Best music app I've ever used,Kevin Smith,19-Mar-16,5,"I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings.  There is nothing it could possibly do better.  I've stopped using Pandora altogether.  Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it.  The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time.  Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else.  Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great.  Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora.  I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release!  If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion.  I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see.  I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."
Amazon,The best music app ever!,Julia Helton,31-Jul-15,5,"I love this app!  Being a prime member has so many benefits, I recommend to all my family and friends.  I can set up different playlists easily.  It is the most uncomplicated music app to use!! I get many free songs that are currently popular and they also have many older songs from all genres.  The only thing I wish Amazon would add is a way for me to stream the music through my playstation 4!!  Thanks so much Amazon!"
Amazon,UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App Isn't Compatible With My 2015 Amazon Fire tablet!,Stephanie Sullivan,19-Dec-16,1,"UNBELIVEABLE! The Amazon Music App will not install on my 2015 Amazon Fire tablet or original Fire TV! When I try the Amazon product page says it's not compatible. Argh!The product listing says it only requires Android 4.1 and both my Fire tablets and Fire TV have been updated to have OS versions based on Android 4.1 or newer. I'm blocked from even purchasing it (at $0 of course). Sometimes you don't even get what you pay for!Maybe I shouldn't complain as the old app works fine for me. On the other hand a lot of good music seems to be disappearing from Prime music and I expect the added cost music subscription may be needed in the future to get good tunes. Just feeling a little dark at a good thing like prime being eaten away in parts I care about.I hope Amazon isn't blocking all older devices from new apps. That would be bad. I'm giving this app only 1 star till this gets resolved, if ever."
Amazon,What happened????!!!! (Updated),Amber,10-Nov-16,4,"Updated 11/16/16 - I updated all of the drivers on my Dell laptop and now this app is working. I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :)**********************I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon. This is soooooooooo disappointing. Help! Isn't anyone reading these reviews that can fix it?"
Amazon,Amazon Music - so far it's CRAP,The Lawn Ranger,15-Apr-16,1,"This Amazon Music software is crap.  It's as if they shoved it out the door without ever testing it.  Just to address the playlist aspect (although there's plenty more that stinks).  First I tried to import playlists from iTunes.  It had the names of them OK and I checked all the boxes - but they never were imported into my library for Amazon Music.  Not the songs in the playlists, not the names of the playlists themselves.  Then I tried creating playlists in Amazon Music.  I could create them OK - but when I tried to add songs by checking the boxes, it would do things like add ALL the songs not just the ones checked.  Then scrolling down the alphabetical list I'd check a song or two to add to a playlist - and the screen would inexplicably refresh, erasing my checkmarks, and re-setting to the beginning of the alpha list.Whoever they had developing this software, they should fire them.  Whoever they had testing it, they should fire them.  Oh, they should fire the designers, too.  It's clunky and it doesn't work."
Amazon,Reboots my phone after a handful of locally stored songs,Jerry B.,23-May-17,2,"I took some time to build multiple playlists. The software updated and POOF my playlists are gone! All that work down the tubes. No warning, just gone. So I go to create new playlists, but now the app REBOOTS MY PHONE after four or five songs play! I'm sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I'm guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally. But that's okay Amazon, I found a new friend in music!"
Amazon,I like Christian music and have a lot of music on ...,David Frisino,5-Jan-16,3,"I paid to have amazon music for a year where I could click on a song and add it to my phone. I should have checked the list of songs available. I like Christian music and have a lot of music on my Ipod from ITunes. it doesn't appear to be transferable to my droid phone so now I have this. The list of bands available was far less than I expected and ended up buying a few albums already. Keith Green is a major artist, Amy Grant, Petra are a few not on the list except a song or two. Please add more artists if possible. Thank you."
Amazon,"amazon -should be ashamed, TOTALLY ashamed",CeltKnitter,5-Jan-17,1,"I want to rip the software from my computer and kill it - this is horrible, it freezes, it shuts off, it takes about 25 minutes to 45 minutes ON HIGH SPEED internet connection to download cd, that is if it doesnÛªt crash in the middle of the process. I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I canÛªt spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. ItÛªs the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered. Again, Amazon, you should be TOTALLY ashamed of this product and what you are doing to customers. I have been with amazon for many, many years, I think since the beginning actually. Too bad... I am DONE!!!"
Amazon,No support for original Kindle Fire,Texas Mark,17-Jun-14,1,"Not that it will help, but maybe another 1 star will wake them up that there are still many original Kindle Fire users. How hard can it be to make this work on the original Fire when the Prime video streaming works just fine. I have a feeling this is just a ploy to get people to upgrade their device."
Amazon,Good service but android app designer should be ashamed.,stew,23-Oct-15,1,"Using Android app on Samsung S4TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free.  Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.Pros :Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon appManaged playlists are nice, good varied selectionLots of good music in thereCons :Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library - no way to disable this - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again) - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scanNo way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as : - specify download location - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music - disable device scan"
Amazon,Good mix of music,Jeff,18-Jul-17,5,"I did not know this was a feature of Amazon Prime! Pleasantly surprised to discover this amazing option. I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the way I would market the service."
Amazon,Meh!,Kalikid30,8-Mar-17,2,The music I listen to is usually a remake or some kind of remix crap that I can't stand. I also do not want to pay a dollar per song for my genre of music. Especially when i can get out my cds or download em free somewhere else.
Amazon,Iphone App Version is HORRIBLE,Comedy is Good,16-Aug-17,1,"The iphone version of this app seems to have constant issues.  When opening the app it takes upwards of a minute for it to load and you to be able to access/select music, this assumes that it does not simply crash on you - which happens around 50% of the time.  Not sure if it is Amazon or the iphone, but it is extremely annoying and difficult to use.If you allow your screen to turn off, it is another minute plus of fighting with it to get it to work.When it does work it is excellent."
Amazon,Disappointed Prime Member,Prime_Member,24-Feb-17,2,"I am very disappointmented in Prime Music and Amazon's new ""music unlimited"". One of the reasons we have kept our Prime membership was because of the music. This is a crappy way to treat customers and keep trying to find new ways to get more money out of them. I notice there are several of the song in My Music that are no longer available to me and they have designated a lot of the more popular stuff to the ""music unlimited"". Amazon should have at least allowed existing Prime members access to the same service they had prior to making the change. We will most likely be cancelling our Prime membership."
Amazon,No way to exit app without signing out completely.,Haze Reid,24-Mar-14,2,"This is a pretty good app...But I hate the fact that there is no way to exit the application without signing out of all Amazon apps completely.This is frustrating.I don't want this app constantly running in the background, but I don't want to sign in every time I want to use it.So the only way I've figured out to exit this application is to go into Android ""Settings/Apps"" and ""Force stop"" the application.Very annoying. Poor design.If anyone knows a better way to exit the application, please let me know."
Amazon,latest update is a disaster,Amazon Customer,10-Dec-13,1,"This was a great app until this latest update. Amongst the improvemnts listed are that it's now supposed to be ""lightening fast""........erm no it's not. I've got my entire mp3 collection stored with Amazon and am now virtually unable to access it. It take minutes to load up album tracks after I click on the album ( if they appear at all ). This is happening on both my Galaxy s2 and my galaxy tablet. Ok they're not the most up to date hardware wise, but then again they are both more than capable of streaming music across a very fast internet connection. Please sort it out soon. In the meantime where can I download the old version of Amazon mp3, as this really is completely hopeless now."
Amazon,Use to be a great application .... now it is garbage,wattsun,28-Jul-17,1,Use to be a great application  but in last few months after last few updates  / redesigns has tuned into total garbage and never works correctly.reinstalling one last time and if issues presist I will be moving to another platform.
Amazon,I Should File A Better Business Bureau Complaint Against The Amazon Corp,Doug Crist,19-Mar-17,1,Amazon Music Suck's. Amazon Corp. Lied To Me. Amazon Told Me Since I Was A Paid Member Of Amazon Prime Video That They Would Give Me Amazon Music For Free & That Was A Big Lie From Amazon Corp. Amazon Corp. Doesn't Know How To Tell The Truth.

Amazon,"Again, Amazon willfully leaves committed customers in the cold",ETH,29-Jun-14,1,"I want to start with this: my dad has nominally enjoyed the use of his Kindle Fire.  But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store.  So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight.  Sure, those 3rd parties aren't pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that's probably because Amazon doesn't want to share.Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers.  Not only does their weak app store show how they're catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."
Amazon,Downloading Purchases Is Slow and Painful,Technology Guy,2-Aug-14,1,"I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music  V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.UPDATE:Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phoneDownload Failed. Error: 1000THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN"
Amazon,"Should have left well alone, the 10/2016 upgrade is terrible",D. SHARGEL,8-Oct-16,1,"I've used the music app for years, mostly the iOS version and a few months ago started using the Fire Tv/Stick version and thought it was all right.  The version just released recently is absolutely horrible however.  No longer can you click on a song and select ""artist"" or ""album.""  You just have the option to play it.  A quick way of playing an album I recently purchased or uploaded was to just find it in the ""recently added"" playlist. Now you can just click on an individual song and listen to the entire playlist.  What is really egregious though is when you go to ""my music"" you can get to your songs, artists or albums and they are in alphabetical order as before but what is missing is the alphabet menu shortcut we had before where we could jump to an artist like Joyce Manor for example, just by quickly scrolling to the J.  Now you have to scroll through each individual artist name by name which if you have a large library can take quite a while.  I feel like I'm being pushed by Amazon into relying on playlists and using the music app as if it was Pandora or something.  I prefer my own library and that's what I want to play but this app makes that more challenging."
Amazon,Music won't play,Laura,30-Nov-16,2,"I love this app. Well, I LOVED this app. After one update, and then another, it's less and less helpful. All the music I own is through Amazon, plus I'm a PRIME member, so I should be able to play all the PRIME music for free. But it's not working out. Music I've bought and paid for is downloaded onto my phone and then immediately deleted without my permission. PRIME music won't play. And other songs that I've deleted from my phone keep re-downloading - again, without my permission. And other songs that do play when tap on them individually, won't play in a playlist. It's very frustrating. I've deleted and re-downloaded this app several times, but nothing helps. And every update makes things worse. I just want the original app back so I can buy and play my music!"
Amazon,Doesn't work properly with Android Auto.,Patrick McNeal,2-Oct-17,1,"Doesn't work properly with Android Auto. Your own playlists are unavailable, unless you want auto-generated playlist of what Amazon thinks you want to hear. Cannot use voice commands properly, either. Most times, if it responds at all, it gives you something wildly different from what you asked for. This is basic functionality and has apparently been broken for some time or has never worked. I know Amazon and Google don't play nice with each other, but removing basic functions from their service is ridiculous. If I'm paying for a music  service, I should be able to listen to it wherever and however I like."
Amazon,Buggy App,Gekigangar,2-Sep-14,3,"It's a good app that plays music even if not purchased from Amazon. However, I took off 2 stars because of a single (and annoying) bug. With Prime music, one can select certain tracks to download and play on this app. However, the app tries to play songs from albums where I've downloaded other songs. For example, if I download ""My Life"" from Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, it will try to play ""Only the Good Die Young"" even if I haven't downloaded it. This causes the music to stop and I have to correct it. Sometimes, I even have to go back and start the shuffle again. Yes, it's on music from the device only so that's not the issue. I hope they fix this soon."
Amazon,I Hear Music,R. J. Province,3-Mar-17,5,"I love the Amazon Android Music app. I like to listen to music when exercising, walking my dog, taking a bath, mowing my lawn and the list just goes on and on.I added my favorite songs and created my playlists using the web interface and my laptop computer. I then use my cell phone to listen to the music. I downloaded all the songs to my phone, so I can listen to them without using up too much of my bandwidth. So far, in the past 2 years everything has worked for me and so the saying goes - I hear music..."
Amazon,I could find all the music I love on this app,MJ T,12-May-17,5,"Yeah they are asking for more money, but suddenly, I could find all the music I love on this app.I no longer have to go to YouTube and listen to less quality music while keeping my phone open so YouTube works. Every song I want is in this.The annual fee isn't bad at all for not having to worry about paying every month, or not finding your song, or listening to ads. It's really a small price.Plus, I didn't find that they removed songs or at least that many songs from their prime anyway.I honestly don't know what people are so irate about.After all, you get what you pay for. You don't think $99 per year would get you free 2 day shipping, free choices of movies and videos, and unlimited music?Come on people!"
Amazon,What is wrong with Amazon?,Stephen C.,31-Dec-16,1,"Problems : 1) Too many Amazon variations of music packages. I'm at a point don't even know which package I have that Alexa booked for me??2) For the first time of my life my Amazon Music on my iphone 7 won't play nor recognized by my 2016 Honda Civic two door Coup? I went around the world to get support and back, no luck. The answer I received is even more confused than EVER!?!? 3) I wonder if Apple is interfering with Amazon? 4) I was a very happy customer until Amazon finally done something out of ordinary?? 5) I spoke to two different Amazon music tech support and received two different answers on New Year's Day, why Amazon??"
Amazon,Buggy & missing basic features.,C,1-Nov-17,1,"1. If your previously owned music is on an external SD card and you add the same music to Amazon Prime music cloud it will see your previously owned music as ""downloaded from Amazon"" yet expired thus unable to play it. Moving music to internal memory solved problem. Customer support was no use. 2. Doesn't recognize .nomedia files = Audiobooks and everything else is now part of my music collection. 3. Locked in playlists! Doesn't use Android's internal playlist database, can't import/export playlists = lock-in to app, waste of my time, total horse s.... 4. User interface is poorly thought out IMO. For such a big company with such a big music footprint I'm shocked at how bad this app is. Seems the bigger the company the worse the app! Sad cause I really like Amazon Prime but their apps are terrible!"
Amazon,Mandatory Inclusion of Prime Music Unwelcome,Bluzfan,20-Dec-15,3,"Until now,  have been buying all of my digital music on Amazon and downloading it to my computers from the cloud player or from my shopping cart. Now I've got a new laptop, and I can't get an Amazon Music App for it without Prime Music being included. I have no need for streaming music, and I don't want the complication of an additional interface requiring me to take the extra step of rejecting ""listen free with Prime Music"" every time I want to buy a song. I want to pay for the songs and not be stuck subscribing to Prime forever.There are so many little glitches in the Amazon Music app already, (most recently, I bought 4 songs in one day and tried to download them all to one computer, but I got a message that I had to authorize my device before downloading songs 3 & 4 after the first 2 had downloaded to that same device) I don't want the additional frustration of having to manually prevent Prime from intervening in every attempted purchase.My solution - don't renew my Amazon Prime membership (so I don't qualify for free Prime Music services) or don't buy any digital music on Amazon."
Amazon,A real plus for me!,S. Chapel,24-Jul-14,5,"I love this app. I have registered both iPhones with Amazon and with each prime album I have purchased for free I've been able to down load to iPhones,and both of my kindle fires. My album collection stored in my cloud really got a whole lot bigger. Thanks to Amazon prime ."
Amazon,Best Streaming Music App or Web based yet.,Amazon Customer,17-Oct-16,5,"First, to clarify, I am not new to streaming audio and have them all from Pandora to Tidal. There are pros and cons to each and everyone's preferences are different. For me, I like to pick a Genre or Style and have the app do the rest (Pandora). On the other hand, I like to reminisce and find specific Artist (Pandora,Spotify,Tidal.)That being said, I don't like to have certain Genres shoved in my face everytime I open the app (You Know who you Are.) Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular ( Tidal and Spotify) for SQ and (Pandora and Spotify) for Cellular.Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available ( Late 2016) I will cancel them as well.Hope this review is helpful, Thanks"
Amazon,Its ok..,Joseph C,28-Jul-16,3,Feels like a wedding DJ while listening. Every now and then you get a good song or the right version. Other times you get the cover band for your favorite songs.
Amazon,If I could give less than one star I would,JoniVL,17-Jun-14,1,"Shame on Amazon for touting this great, new ""perk"" for being a prime member and not giving full access to it. I was really excited when I got the email from Amazon about this feature and was VERY disappointed to find it won't work on my Kindle Fire or my Android phone."
Amazon,"where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the ...",Jill Randall,15-Apr-17,3,"It's all right to have on in the background, no different than Spotify, except for one thing. Some of the songs don't sound right. Has anyone else noticed this? Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped."
Amazon,"Doesn't work! Frustrating, too!",Capt Sax,5-Feb-17,1,"This app keeps in idling when I want to listen to the music. It won't play. I'm sure someone out there is having the same problem. Called Amazon to notify the problem,  but blew me off. I'm a half prime member paying for a full prime membership. Not good. Call me Amazon."
Amazon,Was good until recent change,Amazon Customer,25-Aug-17,1,"This used to be on my kindle fire, making it easy to access my music and favorite stations.  Now it is gone and I'm unable to use.  Making my paid subscription seem worthless!  Why would you make it so difficult to access a service you provide on your own devices?"
Amazon,On the fence,anitaj,16-Aug-17,3,"I don't like that the music I download no longer goes to my own music library, nor do I like the fact that a lot of music choices I paid to download (even as a prime member) aren't available to me unless I become an Amazon Music Subscriber. I do like that it gives you the opportunity to listen to and download music that I wouldn't normally listen to or search for. I think as a Prime Member the subscription price should be lower than what it is. After the 30 trial I'll make a decision to keep or stop, at this point I'm not sure if it's worth it."
Amazon,"Not quite prime, more select",D. B.,22-Apr-15,2,"Amazon Music, not quite ready for ""prime""time, and if I had to pay for the service, I'd request my money back.Heres why I say this. First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon.."
Amazon,Love amazon music.,alex,6-Nov-17,5,This has worked great for us to date. We made a play list for our wedding with this app (I am a Prime member). It's nice being able to take our favorite music with us and being able to save it to an SD card when no internet is available. Only precaution-- you can not change the order of songs on your playlist once you have created it. The first song you save becomes the last one to play and the last one you save the first one that plays. I wish Amazon would add the ability to rearrange the order of the songs on any playlist you create / save
Amazon,Amazon Music app: how I manage the music I purchase from Amazon.,Mike Powers,15-Jan-17,5,"I use the Amazon Music app to manage all of the music that I download from the Amazon music store.  I do this without ever subscribing to AmazonÛªs music ÛÏservice,Û which is something I have tried and don't particularly like. (All of my digital music from Amazon is either Prime or purchased.)I have installed Amazon Music on all my Android devices except for, ironically, my Kindle Fire HD7 ÛÒ which has all of the Amazon Music features already ÛÏbakedÛ in to its software.  I find the Amazon Music app very useful for my purposes, especially now that its interface has been redesigned. I can sort my downloaded music almost any way I wish ÛÒ by genre, song, album, artist, whether itÛªs Prime music or music IÛªve purchased.I also have Amazon Music for PC, so whenever I purchase an album or song, it automatically downloads to whatever device I happen to use to make my purchase. Amazon Music for PC will synchronize itself with my Android devices, so I can very quickly see my new music on my smartphone and tablets almost as quickly as it appears on my laptop.Amazon Music also serves as a music player on my devices. It does a very good job of sound reproduction, although itÛªs perhaps not quite in the same league with some other of the more full-featured (and expensive) music players.I am very pleased with the Amazon Music app. It serves my purposes well, even though I donÛªt subscribe to AmazonÛªs music ÛÏservice.Û Highly recommended."
Amazon,Every mans music.,Gloria Lombardi,23-Jan-17,5,"The best of music to your liking.  Always has what you're looking for and always delivers great pleasure to hear what you choose to listen too.Because I have Prime, I get to pick so many songs without having to buy it, so my choices are endless. This was a genius development of great minds that got together to create something all and everyone could enjoy. It must have taken more than one mind, but if it was one man, wow!"
Amazon,Don't download! Caches streamed music on INTERNAL storage only!,Jon,6-Dec-14,1,"Let me choose where the app caches music.  I was getting Disk Full errors on my phone when I realized it's been storing the music I play in a cache on my INTERNAL STORAGE.  When I looked to see if I could change the location, that option didn't exist.I had to plug the phone into a Windows machine and use Explorer to clear out the cached music.  1.8GB of cached files!  Amazon, you can do better than that.  Give us the option to set the cache location or give up on the cloud streaming business because this WILL NOT WORK."
Amazon,Why can't I organize my music like other music apps???,Karen G,28-Feb-15,1,"This does not meet my expectations.  I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not.  In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm looking for.  Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck.  It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close.  If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer.  If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck.  This app does not let you pull up by composer.  Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app.  I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title.  I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums.  Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to.  I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books.  Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background.  Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too.  However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books.  The code wouldn't be that difficult.  Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good.  My dogs are unemployed and they are pretty good coders.  They'd be willing."
Amazon,Great program with awesome potential but falls short with unacceptable lack of key features and no fixes for years...,Stella,17-Jul-15,3,"I wanted to chime in on Amazon Prime Music. I have been using this service for about a year and a half now. I absolutely love the easy access to my music collection whether I am on the internet at work, out in the world with my phone, chilling with my tablet, or enjoying music through the home surround sound Prime Music is ready to go and streams well!However! I am a serious music collector and I adore having my collection labeled correctly, correct album art, and organised by year of release. Not too much to ask, these are STANDARD music program features since the first Windows Media Player and iTunes....Well you can not change your album art in Amazon Prime Music! In the year 2015 and after years of complaints in the forums you still cannot do this. Yes, there are bogus work arounds like finding the artwork cache on your PC and pasting new arrowroot in there with the same file name as the bad artwork. However this only affects your PC amazon music player, it does not change on your tablet, phone, website etc. Then there is the method of downloading your album back to your PC, adding it to a better music player, using that music players artwork change feature, and then import it back to Amazon Prime Music which may or may not take it or just paste the wrong artwork on it again! Either way this is ridiculous and for a serious music collection this will take YEARS to correct my collection to my standards. So yeah, this is a MAJOR issue for me that really bugs me. Albums will have the wrong artwork, sometimes 3 albums in a row have the same wrong artwork, and many just don't have artwork at all.You also are very limited in how you can view your music, no option for sorting or display release years which is another big issue for me. The program also displays your music very literally by artist instead of album artist. What does this mean? Well instead of displaying lets say all of Beyonce's music under one artist heading of Beyonce, Amazon will have 30+ Beyonce artists, one for every Feat she has ever done. The only way to condense this is to change the artist to Beyonce and lose the information on who she is singing with. This is soooooo frustrating!!When it really comes down to it if i had a better option i would absolutely ditch Prime Music because it is just far too simplistic and limited for my tastes but when you already have a Prime account the price is just too sweet to ignore along with Amazon's fantastic storage limit and bonus features etc. and like i said before, having all your music everywhere and anywhere is pretty awesome! Overall i do like the service but there are just unacceptable issues that frustrate on a daily basis and after over 3 years of this program existing im just left scratching my head at how a giant like Amazon does not fix these issues.... I want to love it Amazon! And it is so easy to fix it so just do it already! I will only hang on so much longer that's for sure!"
Amazon,"Good app and service, weird pricing",C. McDonnell,16-Apr-17,3,"I've been a Prime member off and on over the years but I have issues with having to purchase a membership to be able to have access to the streaming video services and music.  There is nothing special about Amazon music unlimited  that would make me want to pay an additional $7.99 fee to get what used to be included with Prime at no additional charge.  As far as the music app, it works okay although the player could be improved by adding a volume control.  I briefly switched from Apple Music and my catalog transferred flawlessly but I maxed out my Cloud storage the first day and can't add anything else without paying an additional $25 a year, another Amazon gotcha.  They are fooling people into thinking they are getting services for free but they are fleecing your pocketbook. Apple Music is not perfect but it has a lot of features I enjoy and the price you are charged is up front with no tricks or gimmicks.  With Amazon Unlimited Music, that Prime membership becomes expensive.  So, I give 3 stars for the app and 0 stars for the Amazon pricing structure."
Amazon,Yup,ALLIS GERMANE,26-Sep-17,5,"Checking it out. Old Redneck here, looking for more old Classic country.  Not DJ dribble and overplayed popular hits.  ... but ""CLASSIC"", by every definition, Belly rubbin', Belt buckle shinin' dancing with your Woman, cryin in yer beer tunes."
Amazon,... based on just how much this piece of software sucks. It's buggy,Jezreel,1-Nov-16,2,"I'm seriously considering cancelling a long term Prime membership based on just how much this piece of software sucks. It's buggy, it crashes, it won't let you pick which folder to upload/download music to properly, it's a resource hog, it just basically is trying very hard to not let you use the space (which I pay them quite well for) allowed for my own uploaded songs. Absolute garbage. The music importer worked quite nicely, then the previous iteration of this piece of muck started out ok and you could choose your file locations quite easily. This is just trying so-very-hard to be spotify that it's losing sight of what made it BETTER than spotify. Any searches take 10's of seconds to display anything and then when you click on anything it takes an age to open up, if it bothers at all. This is running on an absolute beast of a PC so the issue is not hardware. Currently this piece of software = WOEFUL."
Amazon,The only down side is that they tease you with Unlimited for an extra fee on some of the best songs when you search for them and the stations ...,David E. Hall,1-Sep-17,4,"With my Amazon Prime account, this is my go to audio app. Plenty of ad free music and the ability to store them locally when in areas without service. The only down side is that they tease you with Unlimited for an extra fee on some of the best songs when you search for them and the stations start to repeat songs fairly quickly."
Amazon,This app is OK but it is definitely not user friendly. Very hard to keep musical preferences clear,Stellarr Chance,13-Apr-16,1,"As a Prime member this is a nice way to get music since you have access to hundreds of artists and genre of music.But the app is designed piss poor and is not user friendly at all.First,  the interface is PAINFUL to use. Not only does the app NEVER keeps your music last listened to in check, there is no real way to make a Playlist, keep recently played music in check or even find what you last listened to. Sometimes the app saves it but half the time I  am looking for what I last listened to which is annoying!Secondly, the UI is confusing. It list cloud,  Prime music, library and store but it never really has the list right for what you were listening to or want to listen to. It is just really a pain to find music I want to hear,  even my own music!Thirdly, how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figured that out. The app is so painful to use I really haven't bothered.If you just want to listen to music it OK for that. The app itself is a mediocre music player."
Amazon,FREE Version is fantastic  Paid version probably even better if you want to spend the extra cash!,Len Fredrickson,21-Jul-17,5,"Works very well.

Amazon,... and all I have is problems of which the worst is that I can no longer play the music ...,sadsack,11-Nov-16,2,after several years with this app and no problems something changed and all I have is problems of which the worst is that I can no longer play the music I own and downloaded on my computer.
Amazon,Terrible app won't work,Lonnie R Heidtke,4-Jan-17,1,I tried to get this app to run on my Lenovo Tab and installed it multiple times and all it does is crash.

Amazon,Data destroyer.,ReeVeew,10-Feb-17,2,"When on wifi or data, it will stream your music from the cloud rather than using your devices copy of it. Why on earth would they do that?"
Amazon,Great App for Multiple Device Types! !,Saturnberry,11-Jun-16,5,"I'm really glad I can download my music just about to every device in the house, thanks to the app.  It works on iPhone (5, at least), google's horrid, cruddy phone from Hhhheck, and the fun Windows phone, older versions of the Kindle, o'course. If we had Prime, we'd have access to just a ton of music our family loves! Hmm, maybe we'll do that."
Amazon,Resource hog,Timothy A Bradshaw,3-May-17,1,"I have been an Amazon Prime customer for quite some time now.  When I open up the Amazon Music app, it uses anywhere from 40% to 100% of my resources and will lock up my Virtual DJ program and sometimes my entire laptop.  This is on a laptop with an i5 processor, 16GB ram and a solid state hard drive and that is all I use it for.  I don't have any other programs installed on it.  There is absolutely no reason why this program should kill a laptop in order to play or download a song.  I have also noticed that not every song you purchase and download from Amazon is set up to be downloaded through the Amazon Music app, some are still coming down as a zip file.  There needs to be a standard for downloads and then stick with it.  I will stick with Amazon for a little while longer and if it doesn't improve, I am done with it.  There are too many other options to buy or listen to music out there.  Come on Amazon, you are far better than this."
Amazon,"Good music, bad app",ZackL,26-Jul-16,2,"Music selection is pretty good, features are very basic (or well hidden), but there is one issue that drops it from a 4 star app to a 2 star app (on my Android).  When I am done listening to it, there is no way to shut it off without either logging out (so than I have to login the next time rather than just opening the app) or force quit it through application manager.

DeCaire,20-Jul-16,1,"I have used this app to pick and play music for years now and with this new up date I can't unless I allow access to my photos, media and storage.  What the hell do they need to access my photos for much less my personal media for. So now I can't play any of my music that I paid for or access to free to prime members"
Amazon,Not what  I expected,Kindle Customer,13-Nov-14,3,"I was excited when I saw that you had a way to stream music and such.  The promise of FREE Downloads and listening for Amazon Prime members was even more exciting.  Until I actually saw that ONLY SPECIFIC MUSIC was free.  This reminds me of ALL the other lies told when advertising something free: For your FREE credit report, you MUST enter your credit card number... :-/ REALLY??But overall it's better than what I had so that's why I say it's Okay."
Amazon,Simply Does Not Work Reliably,Random Scribbler,5-Jan-17,1,"Horribly buggy. I installed it on Mac & PC & iPhone. Uploaded an album from my Mac. Looked like it worked great, but: on the PC, every track in the album is listed 3 times, and the album doesn't appear at all on the iPhone app.This is bush-league crap written by amateurs. Don't waste your time.Wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a cross-platform, cloud-based media solution that actually worked? So far, it doesn't exist, because the greedy bozos at Apple and Amazon are just not up to the task."
Amazon,BIG Streaming/buffering pauses compared to Prime Video - No Fire TV Support,Patriot MAGA Man,1-Jul-14,3,"Most disappointed that Fire TV has no Amazon Music with Prime Music app yet.  Also disappointed in this app on Android, it stalls A LOT and requires an app restart or reboot with reload. Streaming is MUCH better on the TuneIn Radio app on FireTV-Android-iOS from many different online radio stations all over the world.  I tried Amazon Music with Prime Music also on Windows 7 and Mac OSX and found it to be inconsistent or get error messages even after installing the latest version of Adobe.On the other hand, Amazon Music with Prime Music seems to work fine on iOS on an iPod.Amazon adding their Amazon Music with Prime Music enticed me to finally get a Prime Membership of my own rather than use a family member's.  However, while the Prime Video is awesome with lot of choice and solid streaming as are all of the Prime Video apps, I am rather disappointed in the Amazon Music poor streaming/buffering problems."
Amazon,"""Sucks"" is way to kind a word",A. B. Cameron,7-Jan-17,1,"I gave the app one star, BECAUSE ZERO IS NOT AN OPTION! Completely ruined a decent app with this upgrade. I cannot upload anything from my laptop now. This app is now just a front end to sell you Amazon's streaming music service or single songs from their store. I don't buy single songs, I buy ALBUMS (and by the way, I have been buying 90%+ of my music from Amazon. This may change very soon!)  On top of that, I pay $25 a year for the privilege of not being able to upload my music!Does anybody know how to start a class action lawsuit?"
Amazon,cloudy with a chance of grrrrrrr,Gary D. Payne,24-Jan-16,1,"Had my hard drive die on my pc. Installed new drive, downloaded Amazon Music to get my cloud music.......... Nothing is there !! So I copied a few of my discs to the hard drive and uploaded them. All the tracks said duplicate. Yet still not in the cloud. Even more frustrating they all show up on cell phone app. Even more frustrating than that, cant download from cell phone. Amazon all I can say is grrrrrrrrr."
Amazon,Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists ...,Amazon Customer,15-Jun-16,3,"I purchased Prime so I could have the music option (music + free shipping was worth it to me, same or a little less than paying the $9.99 for rhapsody). Prime does not seem to have the newer albums (Rihanna, Blake Shelton just as two examples). Prime also does not have a very good variety of music to choose from (less popular artists that I CAN find on spotify). I was able to make playlists which was nice but when I play the playlists it stops after every couple of songs (receiving notifications does not make a difference in the playlist, it just stops playing randomly) but then other times it plays all the way through...I would say this is the biggest frustration. Also, it is slow at downloading. When I had rhapsody it was lightening fast, almost so much so I would lose track of where I was! If you download a few different songs at at time it takes a while to do and you can't search for other songs in the meantime. If Amazon doesn't fix these features I may consider cancelling when my year is up and going with another music app."
Amazon,Passable...maybe.,PeteAndHeatherGooch,1-Oct-15,2,"Crashes a LOT!App is slow, search is sluggish and inconsistent. I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results.The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can't listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping.The selection is limited.Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes. It will help me make some purchasing decisions, though I doubt they will be made through this app."
Amazon,Not worth it,Mr. Tea,26-Oct-16,1,"Selection of music is very limited.... so many more apps that have a better selection, some even for freeUpdate: uses the hell out of my data.

Amazon,I love whole prime option,Domenick Reese,5-Sep-15,5,I love whole prime option. I am a disabled veteran that is home bound. I love music so the music part I really love.  I have not got into the movie part yet but I plan to very soon. I bought a good blue tooth speaker that makes the music sound awesome. I wish this was all a little easier to work and learn. I have about 3500 songs but I know there are a lot of doubles. It would be nice to be able to have the app identify doubles and ask before before you down loaded it again. It seems like this might be something you want to control on your PC. I look forward to the movie part. I use prime to make purchases and I really like that part. Help to make the music more user friendly. Thanks
Amazon,A great way to store and listen to music on any ...,mgengler915,21-Jun-16,5,"A great way to store and listen to music on any of my available devices.

Amazon,Use at your own sanities risk.,Mac75,4-Oct-16,1,"While I actually like Alexa and having my music available.  I have never had worse software.  Amazon music crashes on my pc while trying to upload even 20 songs.  My collection is over 25,000 songs.  Don't even try and do the math, the misery this app has caused me is unbelievable.  I get excited like a schoolboy each time there is an app update... wondering hoping its over and won't.. ... oh fiddlesticks never-mind it crashed again.  I eventually get everything uploaded.

Amazon,Music Unlimited Rocks!,Devin Stephens,13-Nov-16,5,"So far I am really digging Amazon Music Unlimited and the new and improved app..  The selection is now top notch (if you pay for Music Unlimited) and the app works MUCH better than Apple Music on Android!  Being that pretty much my entire purchased music library is on Amazon Music, Music Unlimited seemed like the no brainer choice for my music subscription service.  So far I have been very impressed and would highly recommend it to anyone!!  The app features full albums, stations, and playlist..  The app is easy to navigate!!  The app is easy to download or stream..  And overall, I have had no issues with the app.. I highly recommend it"
Amazon,I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies,SolidAmazonCustomer1cylinder,4-Nov-14,5,"I do notice that on small occasion amazon ""greys out"" a choice, however compared to what the have you certainly can spend a lot time selecting what you want.  I hope amazon does not raise their prices as so far, prime is worth the small increase.  I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies.  Prime movies, however, has such a small offering I ususally just skip those as I don't want even accidentally trapped into further pricing.  We own our own movies, plus have Netflix and Grandma goes to the movies with the grandkids so we are cool with amazon on the movie part.  There has been times in the past you could log on to amazon and there was no movies in prime ...so we got used to it.  Last month we ordered three complete boxed sets of movies so that will keep us busy."
Amazon,Why the short sample times?,Thomas,23-Sep-15,1,"Amazon digital music downloads would do much better with increased time for listening to samples. In most instances, the listener never gets a good idea of the music because of the 30 seconds sample time. I often pass over songs that have a very limited sample of a song that I might otherwise buy. 30 seconds will give you an intro, or part of a verse, or perhaps part of a chorus or instrumental. I would rather know what I am buying when I am browsing for new music. At other sites they allow you to listen to the whole song! Also, allowing the user to choose the folder to download to would be nice."
Amazon,The only music all you need!!!,Cheryl Justice,17-Apr-17,5,Amazon music is way better than Pandora or any other music listening app out there. I love it and  it's the only one I use now.  I've took all the others off my phone to free up storage.
Amazon,Not ready for PRIME time,Oregon Doctor,20-May-15,1,"I'm paying for storage of songs and have about 80,000 uploaded. The player is super slow, erratic, and buggy. By buggy, it sometimes can't find songs and it crashes with great regularity. It also has a sucky interface. It is hard to figure out how to do things like build playlists. I know Amazon will eventually get this right, but for now, iTunes is a much better experience. I'd like to see Amazon puts some resources into this especially since it's a major part of Prime and they charged me for storing my music."
Amazon,"Been patient, but this app is worthless.",LManoog,8-Nov-17,1,"Amazon music app developers: get your sh*t together. I've TRIED to use this app on a galaxy S7 for going on two years. I like that I can theoretically access music as part of my Prime membership instead of paying for a separate subscription. However, this app hardly ever does what it claims to be capable of. Music skips when I have a full wireless signal. I download music, but it just loads perpetually when I'm offline. Today I tried again and got a message that my downloaded music had expired and needed to be refreshed. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN I TAP ""REFRESH MY MUSIC."" Reinstalled the app, made no difference. This is such a joke of a product. Seems like really lazy development -- you're not making any extra off it, so why bother doing it right, right?"
Amazon,"Works on Some Devices, Not Others",Curious,13-Jun-14,2,"Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet, Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet. The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone. The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in ""airplane"" mode. Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded didn't show up. On the phone, and trying to get to music via the cloud, Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days. Advice:  Boycott until they stop that and fix the app."
Amazon,"Learned the hard way, at least it was just one song.",ride_long_distance,28-Oct-14,1,"I thought I was buying and downloading an MP3 file, not some file that sits in a 'library' server. First Amazon music purchase and now the last."
Amazon,Amazon Music Unlimited Review,Bobby Dove,20-Feb-17,3,"Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available.  However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to...  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."
Amazon,"This app is intrusive, difficult to use and unnecessary.",Airedale,10-Aug-15,1,"I don't want to stream music but I do want to download digital music I purchased from Amazon.  This app did it.  It also found every other MP3 file on my computer and added them to this app.  I deleted them all from my hard drive and Amazon Music still has them listed among the albums I just purchased and downloaded.  I just want to play music in my car from a USB drive.  I don't need or want this nonsensical app.After moving the recently purchased albums to a USB drive, Amazon Music decided to download them again.  I look at the settings and there is apparently no way to turn this off.This app is going to make me spend hours doing something that could be accomplished in minutes before Amazon forced me to download the app to buy music.  As soon as I get my new albums copied from my hard drive, I'm going top delete this app and just not buy digital music from Amazon any more."
Amazon,Yup it'll keep me being Prime,AudBrew,21-Aug-15,5,"Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi.  The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."
Amazon,Would give 0 stars if possible,Tyler,6-Jan-15,5,"Crashes every time I want to play a song that's downloaded to my device (android 4.4) whether or not I'm connected to the internet at the time. Of course, I downloaded my most played songs to avoid needing an internet connection every time I want to listen to music which means the app is basically useless to me. I CAN still play songs that aren't downloaded to my phone UNLESS they were previously downloaded. That's right, even if I remove the song from my library, trying to play it still causes the app to crash.UpdateThe app is now fully functional and allows me to play downloaded music as well as stream audio. The redesign isn't as easy to navigate as in previous versions, but it still gets 5 stars because the functionality is there."
Amazon,This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by ...,pashkop,29-Mar-17,1,"This thing is bad. I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.Amazon, get it together."
Amazon,Really Awesome!!!!,Katie A,26-Jan-17,5,"Love Amazon music! It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi (perfect for airplanes). Would recommend this!!!"
Amazon,My go-to music app!,Leaveamark,24-Oct-12,4,"UPDATE: My original review was circa 2012.  My how times have changed.  The Amazon Music app is now my go to app for streaming music and listening to downloaded music.  If you have Prime, take advantage of the stations, playlists and free music!ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA 2012: I have used the AmazonMP3 app both for listening to and purchasing music directly to my phone since the app was first introduced. The app, mostly, performs as expected. It is simple and relatively easy to use. HOWEVER, the app does not allow you to download your music to your phone's SD card, it will only download to internal memory. This is a large inconvenience for those of us who do not always have a wifi signal or have 3g/4g data caps. I travel a fair amount of time and want to have my music available on those long flights. Plus listening to music on my phone's memory is much better on battery life than streaming.Other MP3 app makers have addressed this in their apps.  Google has recognized this issue with their Google Music app and has allowed download to SD since March 2012.  Why Amazon cannot figure this out is beyond me. In the end this will hurt Amazon more than its users. We, as users, have choice and the ability to walk away from AmazonMP3 and choose another music vendor. I can say that I have withheld purchasing many albums from AmazonMP3 for this reason.Until Amazon rectifies this omission from their app, I cannot, in good faith, give AmazonMP3 a positive review. 2 stars until this changes, 4-5 stars if Amazon gets on the ball and makes the fix."
Amazon,"Great quality and selection, poor sorting and searching tools",Lawngahnome,20-Feb-17,3,"First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year (year is visible once the album has been selected, but I've already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading). This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. It's common for me to ""view all"" albums, and it's 3+ indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.I've also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the ""my recommendations"" screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list (specific example below). Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it's a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it's not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is ""The Nexus"" by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that ""The Nexus"" is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not."
Amazon,Takes up all my internal memory.,Amazon Customer,10-Jun-15,1,"Adding my voice here.  Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB.  Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage.  Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music.  I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it.  Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone.  You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected.  You don't need to hog my internal memory.  I guess you are only for top end phone users.  I can't afford you.Listen from the cloud you say?  Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops.  I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what?  It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone.  Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds.  Amazon, I love you.  But I hate your music app."
Amazon,promising but...,manna man,15-Aug-15,3,"I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved.  There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently.  Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."
Amazon,I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle,Steve Winstead,23-Dec-15,1,"this is the slowest app that I have experienced recently.  It is slow to load, slow to update, slow to make changes (order of playlists).  I can't believe a major organization like Amazon is putting this application in competition with Goolgle, Spotify, etc.  The only advantage of this app is that it is cheap.  But, functionally, it it terrible.  I have been an Amazon customer an Prime member for 5 years, but I have to admit that their venture into the music world leaves a lot to be desired.  Amazon, you can do better with the (almost) unlimited resources that you have. Spend some more time and money on this application and you could be the best, but if this is what you are willing to invest in this, users, please go elseware."
Amazon,Build 3.0.2 mistake.,Amazon Customer,7-Dec-13,1,"I keep all my music on Amazon Cloud.  I use this app to listen to my stuff on my phone.  This latest update, 3.0.2 is the reason I gave it 2 stars.  When you're listening to an album, you used to be able to add another to the ""now playing"" list.  This is no longer an option.  Also, the reaction time when you do something, (Skip a track...play a different album...scan forward in a track...) is significantly delayed.Time for a version rollback :)  I wish.Another ""feature"" I just discovered:  When you add an entire album(s) to a playlist, the stupid application plays the tracks in a random order.  (I don't really know if it's random, I didn't qa test for randomness)  This is mildly annoying for music, pull your hair out annoying for audiobooks."
Amazon,I share a membership and pay half with my 76 ...,Lorelei,11-Nov-14,1,"I share a membership and pay half with my 76 year old mother. Because it's in her name, I can't access songs that would be free. She has zero use for it. If only one person on Prime can get free songs and apps, we should be able to designate that member ourselves.I also couldn't download my purchase to my phone without it asking me to change my settings to allow downloads from ""unknown sources"". Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet. The general permissions I had to accept for the app were way outside of normal apps, but making general changes to accept unknown downloads is nuts."
Amazon,Absolutely love this service,KENNETH L.,3-Sep-16,5,"Absolutely love this service!!! Probably one of the main reasons I continue my prime membership. I have XM radio and this service way out performs XM radio. I listen to Amazon Prime Music way more than XM now.  I can pick my own songs and play it from my library or chose from the Prime library.The only CON I can think of right now is Amazon Prime Music needs a COMEDY channel, that is the only reason I still have XM radio.The views stated in this review are based off of my own experience and testing/comparison of this product against other similar products. I am not being paid to review this product nor will I take payment to review a product.If you think that my review was helpful, please press the YES button below."
Amazon,I turned blue when the app did... but Amazon listens,Ron,8-Nov-16,3,"I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.CONS0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.EDIT***Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But  I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.PROSThe color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now.."
Amazon,Not usable unless u live in US or Canada,A. K.,28-Apr-17,1,I'm an international subscriber. I couldn't make use of my prime music nor videos. I couldn't even buy anything. My credit card is accepted for goods purchases but not for music or videos. Apple is doing a better job! Too bad.
Amazon,"Prime Unlimited Good Value, iPhone App just So So, Echo integration Poor",S. Jones,4-Nov-16,2,"I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons - easy things to fix:1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full.  So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"".  On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time.  If this improves I will update my review."
Amazon,Inadequate music selection,Cag,7-Jul-16,1,"I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection."
Amazon,"App works well, the upload process (and programs) is horrendously bad.",Frederick R. Gruner,21-Nov-16,3,"I'm using the IOS app. It actually works pretty well. It seems that some albums in my library need a little update in the metadata, and it will be easier to find the stuff I'm looking for.I've got about 30k songs in my collection. I'm trying to upload all those so that I can access them across all my devices (including my echo). The Amazon music program on the PC and MAC are by far the worst cloud upload program I have ever worked with. Let me list the problems:1) I've got a 4-core 8-thread core i7 machine, it maxes out all my CPU in order to do 3 parallel streams of uploading. On my macbook pro, it shows 110% CPU on a 4 core machine. Uploading a file should not be a CPU intensive process. It slows down my entire PC, where typing stuff into a web browser is about 1 character a second.2) The underlying threads kindof work (I get lots of ""Cloud Service Not Responding Errors""), you have to go back through and ask it to retry files one at a time. Because it's so slow, it takes about 30 seconds to actually select, hit retry, and click ""got it"" and have the popup dissappear.3) The UI hangs, so you have no idea what it's actually doing. I have to resort to hitting refresh on the browser on the website to see what has actually been uploaded. It gives a popup when the upload is complete, but that only happens about 20% of the time (if you're uploading 5 songs at a time). If you upload like 100 songs at once, then it just hangs and shows busy forever (even hours after it completed uploading the last file). You have to quit the program, and go into the task manager and actually kill it. I now do that between every upload.Amazon solutions are typically very good. The kindle programs work amazingly well. This one is total crap, which is a shame for an otherwise very good service (from what I can tell). If they can get this fixed, then their offering should be very competitive."
Amazon,Amazon Music.. it's 2015 and YOU SUCK,vb_lord,8-Jul-15,2,"How can this app STILL not allow you to save purchased music to an SD card?  How simple was that to program!? OMG.. Fix or I'm setting all future teen purchases to Google Music from now on.  This should never have been a issue!  Being the best online retailer on the web, I was sure that this was the place to let my teen buy music for their Android phone.. until it FILLED UP THE PHONE'S SYSTEM MEMORY!!  You wasted too much of my time figuring this nonsense out and to resolve the problem this app creates (going forward) involves taking out the SD card (periodically), and doing all sorts of rigmarole to reorganize the files onto the SD card via my computer?!! Don't BOTHER to suggest third party apps that can't GUARANTEE that all album images will move with the mp3s and be accessible by the CLOUD.  Major fail... YOU SUCK.  Sadly a great online retailer will be losing my music purchases due to lousy app."
Amazon,Best free download site out there (for Prime members).,gtb4775,26-Nov-16,5,"Best free download site (for Prime members).  Allows offline listening on a number of devices (but as one would expect, no copying in sharable formats).  Free music selection is very broad and I enjoy hundreds of songs on PC, tablet, and android phone.  Good options for automatically downloading new library additions device by device.  Also allows you to store owned music that CAN be shared -"
Amazon,Amazon Music sucks.,T. T. Royston,1-Jul-14,1,"This app is clunkier than Windows Vista. Heavy, unmanageable, buggy, and virtually unusable are the strong points. At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets. The fact that you're shoving this drek at us tells me you've lost your way. Disappointed? More than you know. Wow."
Amazon,It Sucks!!!,Jason,16-Jun-14,1,"Yesterday the Amazon mp3 app on my phone updated and went from a great app to one of the worst I've ever used.  It's very frustrating because I can no longer save music to my sd card, the app has crashed several times, and I am getting a lot of download error messages.  It is bad enough that I am considering going tomorrow and buying an IPhone and never buying music from Amazon again. Also a better Prime benefit would have been unlimited cloud drive storage for music rather than a million songs that just take up the very limited storage space on my phone or kill the battery if I try to stream it.  It also would be a very good idea to make it available to use on the kindle fire and Fire TV."
Amazon,Very disappointed,Amazon Customer,1-May-17,1,I have over 1000 songs on this app and I was absolutely loving it! It was included with my paid prime membership and was so nice. Good quality and everything. Then a new update came out and now I cannot add any music to my library because they are all now premium subscription. Now they are trying to make me pay extra to listen to music that was originally free!? And I have so many songs that if I don't upgrade to this new premium standard I have to either A: one by one download every song through a new app. Or B: Be forced to upgrade to keep my music. I thought amazon was awesome before and now they are getting greedy and I guess my money for prime is now not enough. Very disappointed
Amazon,Awesome with Unlimited,Brandon,13-May-17,5,"With Unlimited,  this is now my go to music app!  Spotify does have more of a wealth of playlists, but I think Amazon will continue to improve in that regard."
Amazon,Good variety,Cleo,5-Nov-16,4,"I like having the option to listen to varied stations and my own list from anywhere.  Maybe I haven't done enough research, but I do not know why one day I am able to listen to some songs, then the next they are no longer available to Prime members."
Amazon,Great for Prime users,JR44,2-Mar-17,4,"Great option for prime subscribers, you can set up a library of your long lost music. Also listen to complete CDs before you buy. I really suggest looking into the library option."
Amazon,Grandpa Truck loves this app,Heather McCarty,8-Aug-15,5,"My Dad is a truck driver and he loves this app. manly because he can get all the music he likes into a playlist. He doesn't want to listen to other apps like Pandora because he wants to hear what he likes. This app lets him do that. Most of the music he likes is free to him with my prime amazon membership. Its easy for him to use, he is over 60 and has technical difficulty with working devices but this is easy for him."
Amazon,Great App; Perhaps More Rare or Obscure Tunes Added to Available Songs,SoggyNacho,2-Nov-15,4,"I like this app but we recently just started using it more and I realized that the library of Prime is very mainstream. We listen to a multitude of stations that play songs I've never heard before and when searching for quite a few of those songs, they are not found. The app is used on an Android and loads sufficiently, but connection could be dependent upon carrier. Overall, I am glad I have it, but I hope that the available tunes will be expanded to those that are less mainstream, and leave you wanting more after hearing them play on Sirius."
Amazon,Trying out the 1-month free membership as an add-on to ...,Jared,28-Feb-17,2,"Trying out the 1-month free membership as an add-on to my Prime membership.  They seem to have added a large selection of music to the library, the player is much more visually appealing, and the user interface is more user friendly.  However the search feature rarely gives the results I am looking for, and I cannot search only in ""Playlists"" or ""Stations""...  The biggest complaint I have with this version of Amazon Music is the amount of CPU power and memory it has requires from both my laptop (Dell Inspirion 15 7000 Series) and my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7).  On my laptop I notice an immediate lag in the operation when I open the app.  Amazon Music consumes the most CPU power and is the second largest user of memory.  Since I've installed the app on my phone, my battery is down to 50% by lunch and by 5 P.M. I will have less than 5% battery life.  Typically, I have about 35% to 45% battery life on my phone at 5 P.M...  I have been using this app for about a week and I doubt I will continue with it after the free trial."
Amazon,Need Data to Play Downloaded music?!?!,Robert Ellis,24-May-15,3,I have a Moto X running KK 4.4.4 with this app version 4.4.4 (interestingly enough). I actually really like this app as a Prime Member but the one GIANT mess up that I see is the need for data even to play music that is downloaded. I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me.
Amazon,Not For Kindle Fire (?),Solaris,30-Sep-13,1,"Won't download to my refurbished Kindle Fire (1st gen)! I had to download the ""TuneIn Radio"" app (free version) in order to get the ""Amazon MP3"" app. The ""AMP3"" app is INSIDE the ""TIR"" app. The ""AMP3"" app is located in the upper right hand-corner. And note, you have to be in playing mode in order for that icon to appear. Works good as such. I've been able to make purchases, access Cloud, and download to my device. Sweet."
Amazon,Latest updates hard to use,JTM,19-Dec-16,2,"I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad."
Amazon,"wish i could give it zero stars, haaaaaaaate it!!!!!",WhorableAdorable,15-Dec-14,2,"Only gave this 2stars because my finger slipped when i tried to give it 1.Buggy and inconsistent, stupid, unreliable, needlessly complicated, totally unnecessary BS!!! I understand that all websites have a mission to make everything proprietary, but proprietary apps should WORK CORRECTLY!!! Remember the good old days when you could just buy an mp3 from amazon and they would just let you download it and enjoy it? Then came the mandatory cloud player, now the mandatory app. Every time i upggrade to a new device amazon makes it harder and harder to download my music library tomy harddrive. This app works less well every time ihave to use it. On my thirdvattempt to download my music to new tablet and half the mp3s simply cant download correctly, even though they downloaded just fine to my previous tablet 6 wks ago. Tried it on several different networks to be sure its not just screwing up due to bad wifi; network is fine. Never paying another dime to amazon for music as long as i live. Enough is enough with this crap."
Amazon,... be used for my entire family but a HUGE disappointment is that when Prime is purchased,K G,25-Apr-17,3,"I would definitely rate this app higher if it could be used for my entire family but a HUGE disappointment is that when Prime is purchased, only ONE person in the house is able to access Amazon Music. This is ridiculous! If one purchases Prime for a household, then everyone in the family should have access to the music. Music was a huge reason we purchased Prime. It was a great disappointment when we discovered only one person in our household could access the music. It made our overall opinion of Prime less attractive for our family."
Amazon,it never works,weshophere,19-Apr-17,2,"IT NEVER WORKS. ""sorry this content is no longer available"" EVERY DAY.In fact, NEVER has this ""free"" music bovine excrement ever worked properly.I personally will go back to music the Old School way. I love an artist. I SUPPORT THAT ARTIST WITH MY FREAKING WALLET AND BY THE ALBUM, you know, a tangible object that you can see and touch and HEAR EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU PLAY IT.streaming......bovine excrement."
Amazon,"I love it, but ...",Mike Tarrani,26-Apr-12,2,"UPDATE September 25, 2013: Since first using this with my old (and long gone) Droid X this software has deteriorated in one big way. On my Samsung Galaxy Note II I just discovered that this software downloads your music to the phone's internal memory and there is no workaround. So my new 64gb card is next to useless when I am purchasing MP3 albums from Amazon (which also sold me the 64gb SD card.) This is truly a brain dead piece of software for folks who frequently purchase MP3 albums. Factor that into your decision to download this and purchase MP3 music from Amazon. It's a no-win situation.Original Review:No doubt this is a convenient application and has made my Droid X my best friend (not to mention my dramatically increased number of purchases of MP3 albums from Amazon!)What I love most: cloud storage, and the fact that any MP3 music purchased from Amazon is stored for free, regardless of how much space it takes up. I also love the fact that whenever I purchase a new album it's immediately available to play from the cloud or to download directly to my Droid X.Now for the bad: if I am playing music for hours my device will freeze and I have to force the application to close. And when I say my device freezes, I mean everything until I get a pop-up informing me of such and asking if I want to wait, cancel or force it closed.Another issue I have is when I am downloading MP3 albums that come as disc 1 and 2 (or more), each virtual disc names the tracks with a number, then title. So when they download, virtual disc 1, track 1 downloads, then virtual disc 2, track 1 follows, and so on for every track. The track list is seriously out of order. This is a problem Amazon needs to resolve, even if it means a different naming convention for tracks from multiple virtual discs (i.e., disc 1 would be A-1-track name, and disc 2 would be B-1-track name or some similar scheme. It is not insurmountable.As for accessing my music from the cloud - I have scant luck playing songs from the cloud when I am driving and it's hit or miss at home unless I have WiFi turned on, so I am forced to play from songs stored on my device when I am not near WiFi. I have more music stored in the cloud than my phone will hold, which is why it can be a pain, but I think that may be a limitation of my provider (Verizon) instead of any shortcoming with Amazon. Just be aware that it can be an issue of the underlying technology, including your service provider's infrastructure.Despite my complaints, I have reached the point where I cannot live without the app, so I guess liking it is optional."
Amazon,"Cannot use, have membership too",Chelsea macalik,21-Jul-17,1,"I would put no stars but I can't. I cannot use this app without a so called membership. Even though I have one. It keeps asking me to start free trial or make a payment. But ive already signed up, and am able to use the kindle book app and the Amazon prime video. So why music isn't recognizing my account I don't know. But I've already called twice about this Amazon prime. It sucks having to constantly call for this stuff."
Amazon,battery hog,Rickard,22-Sep-15,2,I hardly ever use this app but keep it on my phone to play music when i buy a new CD while I wait for it to arrive (yes I prefer actual cd's to lossy mp3's).This app is constantly waking the phone to refresh something. It's always towards the top of the list for battery usage even if I haven't touched it all day.
Amazon,Love the Cloud,Kate Fredericks,10-Dec-12,5,"I have used the ""other"" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. II have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!"
Amazon,Has its good days and its bad days,Terp Allan,14-Oct-15,3,It's gone from mediocre to freaking horrible.  I left itunes because they screwed up their program a two years ago.  And recently amazombie followed suit.  It takes twenty minutes for me to access the music and it's molasses if I try to add a new playlist.  It's the freaking cloud connection.  Let me download all the music and you fix the problem.  You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music.  Most disappointing amazon experience by far.Update May 2017 - They seemed to have streamlined the software code.  Running better.  Still kind of slow but a useable experience.
Amazon,Needs lots of TLC,Mr.Wrong,4-Feb-16,3,Received when I signed up for prime I normally use Spotify I like the fact that there is no commercials making a playlist works yet it does not allow you to import the playlist from Spotify. You have got to solve this problem also if I want to sort my playlist for instance alphabetically or when added to the playlist on the app it doesn't allow me to do that I have to manually sort everything. All in all I'm happy with it but you guys have a lot of improvements that you have to make to catch up
Amazon,Great idea but still (in 2014) limited,RHagan,2-Nov-14,4,"Great idea but still (in 2014) limited: does not work in Windows phones (no app), tries to show the cover shot of the selection with often hilarious results (minor issue), and limits playlist size, which annoys me because I have classical, jazz and blues in one big file but can separate them in playlists. Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."
Amazon,Total garbage,Bryan Prince,28-Aug-16,1,"This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show."
Amazon,"I love Amazon for other reasons, but not this package of garbage",Michael J Schamel Jr,20-Jul-17,1,"I figured that after a little time and updates Amazon would have this app cleaned up, this is not the case.App crashes on a daily basisMusic skips when it tries to find wifi signal for my offline music.  Why would it need wifi for offline music?Music selection is limited and put together poorlyNo information given about music selectionsSuggested music is a jokeI have to constantly uninstall and reinstall PC version of the app because it says it can not connect to internetWorst part is that I am paying for this crap.You have let me down Amazon"
Amazon,Does this have a point?,bluecircles,19-May-16,1,"I have just subscribed to this assuming I can replace Spotify/Napster/Apple Music to stream music with. Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem to have a great deal of music. When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it's going to get?! If this is it, I can't help wondering what its point is."
Amazon,Really Poor User Experience - come on Amazon you are better than this,Don Schueler,24-Dec-16,2,"Wake up Amazon. You do a lot of great things, this app is not one of them. If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
Amazon,Wont load on Kindle Fire,Hollins,18-Dec-13,1,I have tons of music on the cloudplayer and cant install cloud player on my Kindle. I have Premium service too. Very disappointed.
Amazon,"Needs an OFF button, too.",Melody L,12-Dec-13,1,"I've only used this app a few times.  The sound is good and it's handy, but each time I've used it when I'm done listening and want to move on, I can't seem to find a way to turn this app OFF!  None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop.  Very hard to find a way to close the app.  I've ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times.  So although it's a convenient way to play the music I bought but forgot to download, I probably won't use it anymore."
Amazon,"Marginal app, at best. Step your game up Amazon.",Aaron,2-Jul-15,2,"Searching for songs is near impossible. I'll be searching for music, type the name of the artist and nothing comes up. Type the first few letters of the album name from said artist and the album instantly comes up. Various other flaws in the app but that is by far the most annoying. Love the ad free streaming and audio quality is pretty good when you're actually able to find the music you are searching for. Bottom line, I expect better from Amazon. This has a beta version feel and experience. Their shopping app is fantastic, this music streaming app falls far far short."
Amazon,I like the variety,Eric Vincent Harris,20-Aug-16,3,"I like the variety, but their analytics suck. I like listening to instrumental music while studying, but I get tired of only classical. So I choose other artists like piano guys, and I do not want to keep saying I do not like the same music on that channel over and over again. I want only instrumental with artists that do instrumental. I had to do a thumbs down 4 times in an hour for Whitney Houston alone on a channel for a composer that only does instrumentals. Please hire someone from Pandora to fix your issue!!!"
Amazon,I think prime is overrated,Mike2theL,6-Dec-14,4,"The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue.  One minute your movie and music are there.  The next minute they are gone.  without warning.  At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service.  Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers.  The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace).  You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth.  The media selection part of prime  (music and movies)  is barely good enough."
Amazon,The only service you need,squeaks327,19-Jun-16,5,Love Amazon music! Tons of freedom complete albums from all eras and genres. Plus great playlists and singles. As a bonus you can listen from the cloud or your device or desktop. Reasonable pricing if you want to buy instead.  Really no downside. Plus all the benefits of prime video and prime for shopping. It's the only service I need to subscribe to.
Amazon,Wwwhhaattt?,teresa,29-Jan-16,1,"I don't  get it.  Sure you can get the app push play on some channel until you maybe find something you like. But if you search for songs pick them,  supposedly download them.... They are no where. I  don't have the cloud. They are not in the amazon music file or amazon mp3 file thet must download with the app.  That is all empty. But there....under Audible..... are unmoveable,  unopenable (my) music that I as a paying prime member ""downloaded"" to listen to. WTFrak."
Amazon,I like it but has some problems,Jessica,19-Nov-15,4,"I tested it out a few days ago and I really like it! It has high quality music and I really love that you can even read the lyrics and sing-along with the song of your choice! It's very convenient for me since I don't need to go online and search for the lyrics of the song! My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song, it's not the right one. So I have to go and look for the albums one by one. It's a hassle for me. Hope they'll fix this though."
Amazon,It's gone....,michmom,11-Feb-17,1,"I have been purchasing all of my music on Amazon for the past several years.  I purchase and download all of my music and generally have never streamed it, this was the first time.  I only downloaded this app to my phone because I wanted my daughter to be able to play some select songs in the car.  When I did the download I specifically chose not to start the ""service"" but just to add the app in order to play the music I had purchased, but in the process saw that prime (of which I belong) had some music groupings that might interest me.  We enjoyed playing the music in the car for a short time using the app because I hadn't downloaded the music to my phone.  It took a while before I realized the thing didn't shut off.  Got to work one day went to task manager and closed the app.  Got out of work and realized it was still playing and had been ALL day, and using up my data. Pulled down the drop down menu and there it was, still playing.  Just picked up my phone this morning and realized it has been playing some unknown music all night.................it's gone, going back to hooking up the phone and downloaded my purchased music that only costs me ONCE."
Amazon,Cumbersome and buggy,C. W. Owen,17-Jun-14,1,"Two primary things about this app.1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised."
Amazon,Awesome Sausce!,Angel,15-Mar-15,5,"Awesome Sausce !!! Being a prime member, you get tons of free music to listen to from the best choices ever, all generations from the time they started recording music. I Love this.  And I don't have to use tons of storage on my CPU to be able to listen to my music, & it's available through all of my devices, Kindle Fire, Cell Phone & Laptop. To listen to anywhere & anytime I choose. Thank You Amazon & All of the Awesome Musicians that share there musical talent & gift with the rest of us out here."
Amazon,$$$$,bcook043,30-Apr-16,1,With all the free music apps out there it makes no sense to own this app. I'd rather put up with pop-up ads that pay for the music then have me pay for it. 1200 songs I have and never paid a cent
Amazon,User interface is impossible,James,3-Dec-16,1,"I *hate* the new user interface.  I use the app on my FireTV with a Logitech Harmony remote (so no voice control - a worthwhile sacrifice to consolidate all remotes).  The new interface completely does away with the ability to jump alphabetically through your songs and albums.  You now have to scroll all the way through your library staring with the numbers and slowly making your way through each and every title in your library.  I have hundreds of albums and thousands of songs.  This interface change has made the music app useless to me, and negated a big part of the reason I bought the FireTV in the first place.  I really hope to see this addressed soon."
Amazon,Finally something that rivals iTunes,Mark Andresen,18-May-14,5,I've finally cut the ties with all Apple devices and no longer have any need for iTunes.  I especially love this app on my Galaxy S4 while driving in my car using blutooth.  The only problem I have is sometimes albums are split into multiple folders.  I was amazed to find that all the mp3's that I've ever purchased from Amazon showed up on my device as available to stream!
Amazon,Paying for cover bands,Jstreeter,10-Nov-17,1,The app works great on my Android and my new iPhone only problem is trying  to find music made by the original artist.unless you want to hear 1 album at a time and stop after 8 or 10 songs to search again. if your looking to listen to a mix of songs Plan on wasting hours searching and searching  through endless cover bands or remade songs or remixed songs from artists IÛªve never heard of doing original Artist songs.
Amazon,"App does not store MP3s on External SD like other services puts songs in wrong order, splits albums up  & corrupts track names",MDH,25-Mar-14,1,"1.  The Amazon MP# player does not have a setting to store the music off of your internal memory. I travel a lot on business and only downloading 6 albums is not enough. To move your mp3s to an external SD card in your phone takes using ES File Explorer or similar app.2.  The problem is even if you do that the Amazon MP3 app will not find it on the SD card. I ended up trying to use the built in music player on my Samsung Galaxy S4 but wait! the file names are now corrupted. Basically Amazon has chosen to add their gibberish looking item numbers to the front of file names such as B00134NFVG_(disc_1)_02_-_You're_No_Different. This makes it impossible to index on other players. So much for no copy protection take your music anywhere. It has changed to take your music anywhere through Amazon's player, and stream it even though you have to pay your cell carrier extra for the 250mb per 30 minutes it takes to steam music because we won't let you store the music on external storage.3. I have over 11,000 tracks on Amazon Could but only pick and choose a handful to download. When I stream or download the songs the albums show tracks in the wrong order. Try listening to Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon out of order. (There are many albums produces in a certain order & Amazon screws this up - been like this for years. Never fix it)3. I am also having issues with a single album being indexed by Amazon as two to four different albums each with a few songs on them. Click play album {so and so} and it will play 3 or 4 tracks and stop. Pull up the app and you will see where they are split up incorrectly.This app used to be pretty decent but it has gotten much worse over a few years. Now I am going to search for a new alternative whether it is Google, Apple or just manage it on a home server and keep 3rd parties and the music industry out of it."
Amazon,Not sure what amazon did to it...,Josh,3-Nov-14,1,"But it's terribly broken. First of all, this new &#34;Amazon Music with Prime Music&#34; only works on certain devices. The old &#34;Amazon MP3&#34; app worked perfectly all the time. Second, when it works, you get Constant &#34;nag&#34; screens &#34;reminding&#34; you in the most intrusive way possible to try out Amazon's new Prime Music service. These nag screens can be dismissed, but they intermittently continue to pop up. Finally, the newest update won't even open without crashing and it keeps trying to open itself and ends up in a &#34;crash loop&#34;. They should have just left it alone, now I can't listen to any of my music. I guess I'll have to export everything, and start using Google music."
Amazon,Needs some Lovin' Care!,BC,1-Jul-15,2,"As much as I love Amazon, this app is atrocious. The MP3s that I upload have solid, complete tags with album art embedded and without fail, Amazon Music continues to split albums and ignore my embedded album art. I can understand occasional hiccups with such a vast repository, but this Amazon Music library system is well beyond buggy.If I had to guess, I'd say the app is actually working as intended, but the database and index system that exist in the cloud is so anemic and antiquated, that it can't handle the simple and fundamental functions that I've come to expect from a music library application.Please review and consider an overhaul, Amazon. I love Prime, love my FireTV and love Echo, but this music system doesn't deserve to be included in that list. Sorry."
Amazon,Not Bluetooth friendly,Stephen,12-May-16,4,"It's my main music source. Only issue I ever have is with Bluetooth headphones,Amazon music will distort with to much bass,sounds great on corded headphones,I've tried several Bluetooth headphone sets,same result. Every update I hope it's fixed,but never happens. I don't get this problem with any other music source. It would be a 5 star app if not for this issue. I've also checked with other people,they get the same problem."
Amazon,I am extremely happy with this app,A. Carey,21-Jun-16,5,"I am extremely happy with this app.  It is easy to search, download, and play the music.  The variety of music is also an asset.  I can now play my favorite music where ever I go.  At the pool, beach, or even in the car,  I've also used it while walking my dog for exercise."
Amazon,"this was great, til the latest update for my phone",Frank S. Gross,15-Aug-16,1,"this was great, til the latest update for my phone. the icon disappeared, cant find it in my apps.  when i go to re download it amazon says you already own it and doesnt install it.  basically, either the phone or the app say its on the phone, but it cant be seen on the phone and amazon or the phone wont let it re install..  frustrating."
Amazon,Could be better kid selection of Christmas songs.,Kerrie Ann,27-Nov-15,4,We used this on my Samsung Galaxy S5.  I connected to my car stereo via auxiliary cable and played Christmas songs.  I do not like that skip feature is limited and they wanted me to pay to skip more often.  I also wish there was more of Disney type based Christmas play list for the kids.  My girls respond better to the Sprint Disney playlist I used later.  I will probably play with this feature more in the future as I am paring down some of my Comcast features for more affordable options.
Amazon,"Et tu, Brute?",Kevin McCluney,2-Jun-17,1,"I'm a fan of Amazon, but this app has lobotomized my music collection so many times. In addition to causing my phone to choke into freeze mode, the app isn't easy to use. Furthermore, it won't let you put your Amazon-bought music into a folder of your choice to live with your other music. In addition, it heavily favors streaming, which isn't why I *buy* MP3 albums! I want to *have the MP3 on my device* to save on data and play when I have no signal. *Not everyone lives where they have good, constant signal!* This app is too reminiscent of iTunes and its user-adverse interface and method of railroading the user into using *only * this app...if the app was decent and allowed me to play and use non-Amazon music *without choking my phone to death,* maybe I'd use it. This is far below Amazon's usual stellar standards."
Amazon,Love this Prime benefit,TXFirewife,20-Sep-16,5,"I love the prime music.  I have put together a mix of music to listen to during my work day.  Anyone that knows me knows how much I love music.  Since my Ipod is on the outs I have used Amazon Prime music nearly every day.  I listen to it while I am mowing, doing my walk in the evenings, at work and in my truck.  Great benefit to having Prime."
Amazon,making Prime Music mostly useless for me,Kindle Customer,20-Nov-15,2,"Prime Music may not be one of the most popular o well-known of the Prime services, but it was one of the main reasons I joined. My main use for it was to download music to my phone for listening offline, mostly in the car. Notice I said ""was"", because recently that functionality has stopped working for me. I am unable to download music from my cloud library to my phone, making Prime Music mostly useless for me. I will probably keep Prime, as I do like the other parts of Prime, but I am very disappointed that Prime Music isn't working as it should."
Amazon,App is buffering....stops playing music after 2 songs,RC,6-Jul-16,1,I used to love this app recently it stops playing music after one song. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the same problem is occurring. I also do not like the fact that the app starts on startup & permissions cannot be changed. I have amazon prime but the music app is lacking.
Amazon,Worst support ever,M**J**A,27-Mar-17,1,"There should be an option for zero stars. Amazon music support is nonexistent. It has been outsourced to the Phillipines. The music stops streaming after 3-5 songs. I know it's not my system as I don't have the problem with pandora, Spotify, Netflix or any other steaming apps. They can't even transfer you to someone in the US if you request it."
Amazon,Love it! Coming from Pandora I am almost overwhelmed ...,MTN Warrior,18-Jul-17,5,"First impressions after a week of use:  Love it!  Coming from Pandora I am almost overwhelmed with what to listen to next.  I love Pandora, but it is not like this.  I'm not sure I will like the price once the reduced cost trial ends.  And I still need to figure out if I can make it work with my Yamaha surround system."
Amazon,I would definitly recommend this app,E. Waldrip,18-Jul-17,5,"Love just about everything about this app.  I can share my music easily on all my devices, computer, tablet and phone.  It's easy to access and it shows how many songs and how long my playlist will last.  Makes it easy to plan my listening day."
Amazon,Seems a lot like a music promo app instead of a tool for my music,Ed Paulson,30-Sep-16,3,"I got this app and paid the extra for the year to have MY music be available to me. Instead, every time I open it I have to wade through Amazons's music to get to mine. Wish I could shift it around and have it always default to MY music instead of always promoting others music first."
Amazon,Add Visualizer to Make it 5 Star App,Sashenka Goodall,30-May-16,4,"Dear Amazon,Can you please add a Music Visualizer to this app? pretty please? I'd love to play my Prime Music playlists through the tv box on my projector when i have guests (who are usually inpressed by the app's sophistication and music variety) but no one wants to stare at the prime music menu pg all evening. Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda...  undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind....  then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device...  its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)"
Amazon,screwed up,S.,6-Jun-17,2,You have really screwed up listening to music using Amazon.  I will go back to listening to Pandora or Music Choice on my TV.  I ALEADY PAY FOR PRIME WHICH IS A JOKE BECAUSE MY PACKAGES HAVE BEEN LATE 4 times since December.
Amazon,It's an ok player but nothing great. It will download the songs I've purchased from ...,runner,11-Aug-17,3,It's an ok player but nothing great. It will download the songs I've purchased from Amazon so I have them locally.  I can not differentiate between them and ones I've put on the SD card directly from my computer. The browse or search buttons search online but not my own database for specific songs. I liked the older versions of Amazon Players I used in the past better. They seemed to do a better job of managing large data bases with thousands of songs that are on the SD card.
Amazon,"Needs WAY more music variety, but it's better than a lot of music apps.",Chris,23-Oct-17,4,"it's better than google music or spotify, your playlists can be lost on your offline library and I've had to reinstall a couple times, BUT it is way easier to recreate your playlists and library more so that google music. I also like the online playlist options but it won't work with local on device music that you have, it has to be online. and it needs WAY more music options. But it's ok."
Amazon,Nearly useless,Nathan Duin,22-Jun-17,1,"It is strange that a behemoth like Amazon cannot do better with Amazon Music. Everything about the service is second rate, the home page is embarrassingly antiquated, and with no way to adjust the useless Recommendations we end up with links to an endless variety of slop we are not even mildly interested in. There is literally not one compelling reason to use Amazon Music instead of TIDAL or Google Play."
Amazon,MUSIC FOR LIFE!,Alfred Scott,4-Aug-17,5,"A good catalog of music to select from ! The only flaw, would be that they don't have all of the albums, for some artists' discographiesThe stations, who are named after specific artists, offers a great mix of music to listen to all day long!"
Amazon,Amazon Music + Alexa,Bruens,1-Oct-17,3,"I use Amazon Music all day everyday. It's my source of music. I utilize Alexa in my apartment and the Amazon Music app while mobile with my Pixel XL. I love it! Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I've desired for awhile now, however, you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I'm even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I'm giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing! _ÙªÄ"
Amazon,"WARNING INTERNAL MEMORY NEAR FULL, SOME FUNCTIONS MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY",Joey,9-Mar-15,1,"I have a Galaxy S5, and all my problems with it were related to the Amazon Music Player.  It swallowed up my internal memory and really messed with the phone operation.  So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory.  It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it.  They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps.  You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card.  But it doesn't always work.  It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs.  While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure.  I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.  So one star, because Amazon knows the problems and can't seem to get it right.  Really who can store all their music in Internal Memory.  Take you mind off drone delivery which will never fly, and deliver your music....."
Amazon,Crappy App Update: pushing customers to Itunes...?,Amazon Customer,5-Nov-16,1,"Looks like Amazon is pushing people to Itunes with the latest iteration of Music.The prior app was relatively stable and offered music afficionados a reasonable interface for downloading their digital purchases. With the new ""blue"" release, I am back to downloading .ZIP files like it's 1999! This poor interface takes away the entire incentive of skipping cd purchases.As a prime member who purchases both hard and digital media, I am no longer purchasing digital (unless it's dance music), instead I will go back to CDs and rip them myself.Amazon, this iteration is complete crap. You can do better than this!"
Amazon,"Not bad, unless your device has small built-in storage, or you have poor data connection.",!,29-Jun-14,2,"UPDATE:I find that I use this app less and less. I think the most annoying part is that it ALWAYS tries to sync to your cloud library as soon as you launch it. On the surface, this isn't a bad thing. But the problem is when you don't have solid data coverage or wifi, like in a tunnel or in a building with thick walls. As it tries to sync, the app freezes and you can't do anything but force close it.Ideally, there should be an option to sync only on wifi or manually by pressing a button. I have several albums downloaded/cached locally and never stream. So the app should just play those local albums and forget about trying to sync any other songs I have in the cloud. Sheesh.___________I downloaded this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. It's actually not a bad app, even if you don't have Prime or don't purchase music. It recognizes/plays non-DRM music that's already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple, responsive, and not annoying. I like it a little more than the Google Music app. And it's much better than all those free apps that either have limited features or annoying ads, unless you pay up.I'll also echo my complaint here about not being able to store Prime/purchased music on the SD card. It's really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card, but not any of the music. In a perfect world, we'd have unlimited/reliable mobile data everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality is, we still need to download/cache locally to our mobile devices. Hopefully, Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchased music on the SD card."
Amazon,"Amazon prime music, better then your favorite mixed tape times a 1,000",Tammy,22-Jun-16,5,I love Amazon prime music I haven't listened to music like this sense my 20'S and 30'S they make it so easy I have 6 different Playlist so easy to add too. I love even the stations no advertising just music any way to many perks to even try to list them all
Amazon,Once re-installed it runs great. And I was unable to find the solutions in several Windows 10 books.,Gary S,18-Jul-17,4,"Nearly perfect. I did need to re-install the app following problems. I bought an Anker Bluetooth speaker, and I needed to re-install the app on my smart phone. Once I did it runs perfectly. Until then it was frustrating."
Amazon,... my go to music app and I find it easy to understand,jeffrey d taylor,17-Jun-17,5,"This is my go to music app and I find it easy to understand. I can compile my own playlists. If you upgrade to Amazon unlimited (79/yr for prime members) a vast amount of content is at your disposal. You can still use the prodigious content of just the Amazon Prime content, if you don't want to pay."
Amazon,Streaming randomly stops every few songs,Ryan D,5-Mar-17,3,"The page needs to be refreshed a lot- an issue never experienced with spotify. It's not as bad as youtube where for each video/song you need to click on the tab/window again. (Then again youtube can be used for free.)Aside from random pausing of music, there is a decent selection of music- some artists I wasn't expecting them to have. Although, many artists are not available and very few are available with a full album collection.It works for me since I already have prime, which is well worth it for how much I order. I'd give it 4 stars without the streaming errors and 5 with a better selection."
Amazon,Not a worthwhile service.,Cassady Brunette,15-Jan-17,2,"The selection is much smaller than most other streaming services, and Amazon Music doesn't even have all of the music which Amazon sells, meaning I can't even use it to listen to many of the CDs I bought with Amazon.Then, if I want to download my music I've bought with the ""AutoRip"" that Amazon emails me about every time I buy a compatible CD, that's awful, too. If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you're buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you'd like. Amazon Music doesn't; Amazon Music says you'll get .mp3 and you'll like it. Of course, Amazon Music doesn't give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. That's right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.If you care about quality, I wouldn't bother. I know I won't ever use it again unless I can download a lossless rip."
Amazon,... world do updates always seem to mean making things worse. this app was ok before,AD,24-Nov-16,1,"why in today's world do updates always seem to mean making things worse. this app was ok before. not great by any stretch of the imagination, but it worked 'ok'. now it does not work ok. it is even less user-friendly, more clunky, unwieldy and just difficult to use. i cannot comprehend how or why this could have happened. i understand apple's music player on iphones is designed to be clunky to 'subliminally' push people towards their paid content. but i don't understand this. we are already paying for eg prime.my recently added playlist contains only one album, that was not recently added. it doesn;t include any of the music i have bought in the last 48 hours. this does appear in the purchased playlist though. downloading to my mac now appears to take 1000% longer than it did. and the format of naming artists and albums has changed. you can't use the shift key to select multiple items to download. it is awful.amazon - answer your ""prime"" customers - what are you playing at???? sort this sh8t out!!!!"
Amazon,Can be much more intuitive and easy to navigate,Amazon Customer,14-Oct-16,3,"There are other apps that are more intuitive but I have to use this one for prime downloads.

I know that makes me singularly unenterprising. But I found exactly what I wanted in complete. In short, I'm totally happy with Prime music access. Try it."
Amazon,Amazon Music rules!,Amazon Customer,8-Apr-17,5,"I love the radio stations and playlists, and love being able to put my own collection up there. I listen at work all day."

I also wish it was a bit more clear which music was free for Prime members. I thought a certain album was going to cost me $10, then it ended up free. That was a good thing. I'm worried that I'll end up being charged for music I think is free. Very confusing for some who is new to this!!!"
Amazon,Ruined it with latest update,PJC,9-Dec-13,1,"Latest version is horrible. Performance is worse and the app is now buggy. The UI hasn't improved and think it is worse than previous version. They also got rid of some features like adding song to playlist directly from song vs. now having to edit through the playlist. Good job Amazon, guess will now have to look for a new player."
Amazon,... been using Pandora in the past and was relatively happy. Once I downloaded the Amazon Music with Prime ...,Amazon Customer,10-Oct-15,5,I have been using Pandora in the past and was relatively happy. Once I downloaded the Amazon Music with Prime Music I haven't even thought about my Pandora. The selection of music and the playlists plus the customizable playlists of Amazon Music is way better than any other music app I have encountered.  I am super happy with this app and have put it on all my devices. Plus its free with my Amazon Prime subscription which was all that much better. Win Win. Can't go wrong with this App.
Amazon,"Amazon, fix this BS!",O. Oleynikov,30-Jan-17,1,"Very poor app. As of 3-4 days ago the PC app started crashing constantly on launch and would not run.  The ""blue"" interface is horrendous and extremely confusing. Amazon Music app on my Blackberry Z30 phone is taking 3-5 minutes to sync its content after every launch while there is NO new content to sync!!!!  Why do I need to waste time for this useless operation?  Why does it not let me listen to the music while it is ""syncing...""? Why does it not sync in the background?Frankly, the more I use Amazon software the stronger is my belief that it is on par with Microsoft's in terms of confusing UI, marketing-first approach and ""beta"" quality.  Has anyone tried navigating Amazon's AWS portal to check the usage statistics? It's like a US Government web site - bloated, confusing, full of unneded noise."
Amazon,I HATE this app,factorygirl43,1-Jul-16,1,"I HATE this app. I can't believe Amazon can't get something better designed. As far as maneuvering when using the app, it seems to be extremely sensitive....you can scroll down and all of a sudden what you were working with is gone, or hover over something for a second and you're another spot. My search bar doesn't work, it pulls up nothing, so I've been scrolling to find stuff and I have A LOT of music (see my complaint about scrolling). Much of my downloaded music is missing information and I have to manually fill it in otherwise music isn't where it should be...for instance, I had an album that was downloaded as 12 separate songs because there were no track numbers.  I can't click and drag one album or artist to another area, so anything from, say, Joan Jett is separate from anything filed under Joan Jett & the Blackhearts...I have to manually change the info. Many albums have the wrong album cover art, sometimes even belonging to another artist, and some albums have no art whatsoever....there doesn't seem to be a way to copy an image from the internet, so I can't fill it in manually. The app is visually boring. I liked it so much better when you downloaded and it went straight to Media Player...Media Player is a far better app."
Amazon,Finally installed... [updated],Rick,28-Jun-17,4,"Recently purchased a refurbished LG G3, and the app will not install (even though every other Amazon app works).

Amazon,Poor sound quality,Jennifer,27-Mar-17,2,If you are going to create a music app where you are selling music at least make sure the sound quality of the music sounds good. YouTube sounds much better. Sound a like my speakers are blowing out even on low volume. I have very good speakers
Amazon,Jazz and single-malt!,J. R. Fawcett,28-Jul-17,5,"Nothing better than listening to my favorite music on Amazon, sitting on my deck, enjoying a single-malt scotch and a nice Cohiba!

Amazon,It isn't working,S. Conley,9-Nov-17,1,"It wont install for me. The first time I tried I lost my signal and after that it would just not install. I tried going to my settings and uninstalling what was there and starting over but that didn't work,."
Amazon,New update leaves much to be desired,M. Granger,16-Jun-14,2,"While it is very convenient to have my Amazon music on my phone, this app still leaves much to be desired. The previous version of the app was very good, allowing me access to my Cloud music and the music store. As it was, I would have given it 4 stars. The reasons for the loss of one star were that 1) You can't store music on an SD card, and 2) You can't sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise, it was a very good music player.However, with the new update, I am of a VERY different opinion. This new update is so full of glitches, it's almost unusable. The correct album art rarely shows, songs take FOREVER to load (even when they're on my device!), I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen times and the song won't change (although the song title text and album art will!). It also runs MUCH slower than the previous version. I'm quite certain it's not my device- I'm using a Galaxy SIII, on which all other apps just fine. I'm giving it two stars because the new layout is very nice, but that doesn't really count for much when the app itself hardly functions.Very disappointed, as releasing something this rough is very un-Amazon-like. They should have done more testing for bugs before releasing. Hopefully they will fix the bugs soon with a new update."
Amazon,Works Great!,Chadwick,31-Jul-17,5,"Love the app. I like that I can turn off my screen and still listen on my Android. Also, I like that I can add a play list online with Prime which I think is easier on the computer. Can swipe down or hit the screen on for pause option. Nice!"
Amazon,"I am a cranky oldie, but I find it good and easy to use. Works well and seems to have options needed. Thanks Amazon!",Lynn K,6-Jun-17,5,"works well. seems to have all the same options needed.  I did notice my new ear phones shot up to full blast on it's own, but that may be my phone's fault.

Amazon,Galaxy 4S,Jo Anne Moore,27-Mar-14,2,"Before I even checked out the native apps on my new phone, I went to the Amazon store to download this app (along with others previously purchased).

There were enough bad reviews to give me serious pause, and after realizing the app would only store to phone internal memory (not the memory card), as well as the syncing issues, I have decided to give this app a pass and use the native music player preloaded on my phone.  Sorry Amazon- I will miss being able to download music directly to my phone from Amazon purchases- but not enough to use your app."
Amazon,It's my favorite music app,Z.Abby,8-Jun-16,5,"I use it all the time. It's my favorite music app. My only annoyance is that I can't find every song on the app, but it's not much of a bother."
Amazon,Adding songs to your playlists is a pain. Rather ...,S. Kelly,30-Sep-15,1,"Adding songs to your playlists is a pain.  Rather than the normal way of searching for a song and then adding it to your playlist you first have to add it to you library, then you have to go into your library and search for the song again, then you can choose to add it to your playlist.  And the biggest problem is that there is no SD card support.  Many phones have limited storage, but Amazon doesn't care about us people with older phones.  It makes the app nearly worthless."
Amazon,Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work everytime.,Amazon Customer,21-Feb-16,2,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service.  Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it.  Well, I'm wrong.  My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no.  Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible.  So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app.  The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud.  Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song.  I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play.  What's the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) .  But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."
Amazon,DO NOT WANT.,Savannah,25-May-15,1,"I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!"
Amazon,Amazon is pretty cool. I mean its such an easy app ...,Amazon Customer,3-Sep-17,5,I really thought all of these spacific thoughts and holly molly guacomole these others feel the same but write a quicky review... I'm telling u that itS Kinda something you gotta try with the website of choice. Its an update. So beware that I tested it as a viewing point.Amazon is pretty cool. I mean its such an easy app to drop it like its not the coolest thing to apply for. So next time complain to yourself and understand the actual website. It's not that hard to understand the concept. Apply or dont apply?For me I figured it out. 5***** rating.
Amazon,but at this point it's a better option to just pay for shipping normally if you ...,Jacob K,10-Nov-14,2,"The app itself lags behind competitors in appearance of the UI, fluidity, song selection, and price.  Some may say that ""it's included with prime so why complain?"", but at this point it's a better option to just pay for shipping normally if you need to and sign up for rhapsody or spotify (or save even more and don't use streaming services).It's just unnecessary and costly. Honestly the only reason I cared for Prime was the shipping benefits, but when they decided to attach video (again not as good as netflix or hulu)  and music to it and double the price, I cancelled my membership renewal. I would prefer a tier set up where you can elect which services you want, but i suspect that would reveal just how overpriced the services are and Amazon would lose too much money to keep them around."
Amazon,One of the best perks of Prime!!,A. Randolph,1-Feb-16,5,"I am able to hear music selections from albums that I wouldn't have heard unless I used a torrent site and download the whole album. As far as I am concerned this is the best perk to Amazon prime.The best thing for me is when in NYC subway, my phone has no signal between stations, but yet Prime Music works 90% of the time. Meaning it will play the next song in the in your queue with no signal. I don't know how it does it but I love it."
Amazon,"Amazon misleads you to get you in the door, and then will not let you leave. Amazon Music = Hotel California",Nighttimehobby,18-Mar-16,1,"I have been a subscriber for years, and always fought through the hassles and headaches, but now I have hit my limit. Amazon Music says it can handle 250,000 songs, which is great for large libraries, so I uploaded tens of thousands of songs I had ripped and purchased over the years. Every CD I owned, every digital song I purchased, all of them of the last 40 years. This process took forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way."
Amazon,One Star,Lovinclayandthings,20-Aug-17,1,App continually stops working. Sometimes never connects on network. Only works at home on wifi.
Amazon,This one fix could improve your app in offline mode,Amazon Customer,9-Jun-17,3,"Just writing a review to give feedback. When I open the app to listen to offline music but have poor reception, it takes forever to load. If I turn off my internet connection, it loads instantly. Obviously there's a ""phone home"" check going on, and if you delayed that or did it in parallel, the app would perform much better!Otherwise, it's an ok app. I count Amazon music as a nice bonus to prime - certainly not why I got prime, but nice to have anyway"
Amazon,Excellent musical companion to feed my ears!,Paul S. Remington,17-Jul-15,5,"The Amazon Music app has become my app of choice for accessing the library of music on my phone and also music in my Amazon cloud storage.  What I love about this app is it also provides access to TONS of Prime music, which is free to those with Prime accounts.  I love the stations and playlists.  I use them when working out or when I'm out for a bike ride.  I select a station or playlist, and I'm on my way.  Amazon selects a very nice collection of music to keep me company.  The stations gear musical selections around the sensibility of the artist chosen.  So the Jimi Hendrix station, for example, plays artists who are in the same general musical family as Hendrix.  Amazon also tosses in a few Hendrix pieces too.  There are hundreds--possibly thousands--of stations and playlists to choose fromMy only criticism relates to getting a feel for how the app works.  It took me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music.  Be careful of this!  If you've saved your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone, be sure you've selected Device!  If not, it'll go to the cloud to stream.  You'll eat up data doing that.  I've made this mistake a few times.Very much recommended!"
Amazon,Watch out - was Prime Music - No Longer Prime its greyed out and they want me to buy or remove.,Texasman,3-Oct-16,2,"OK, have been a prime customer just about ever since I can remember.  Joined Prime Music this year, took a while to get use to it over Pandora, but was fine until today.  Went to my favorite play list and there were a bunch of songs that were Prime music and use to play all the time, and now the Prime logo is greyed out, and a prompt comes up with remove or buy.  Truly a bait and switch tactic, that could almost be considered against the law.  Second issue, last month I uploaded or I should say tried to upload discs out of my personal library.  What a pain, they would only allow certain songs to be uploaded to my prime account, dialog box stated: incompatible format.  Odd, they play on everything else I own.  Most likely a licensing or royalty issue.  Not at all happy now.  I had a Stevie Ray Vaughn album that was all Prime Music, went to play today, all greyed out, they want me to buy now.Iit wasn't uploaded, don't own a copy. I will provide an update if I hear from them.  I don't like surprises, don't think anyone does."
Amazon,Do NOT install the Prime Music POS,Amazon Customer,15-Jun-14,1,"Confusing, horrible interface. CANNOT UNINSTALL UPDATE once you apply it. Cloud/Device tabs are gone and how you find your existing music is a complete mystery. Impossible to tell whether you're purchasing music or getting it through Prime. I'm uninstalling this app completely. Amazon Prime music is definitely not ready for prime time. Thanks for pushing out a crappy app without giving me the ability to roll back to the old, much more elegant interface."
Amazon,LOVE IT!,kporche,24-Jun-15,5,"I absolutely LOVE Amazon Prime Music!  The choices are endless and 90% of the music I am looking for is included in my membership.  I downloaded the app on my phone and have replaced my previous streaming music with it! I love how you can have your own library of you favorites, but choose a station to listen to when you feel like something different.  They have channels to suit any mood and you can set up different playlists from your library.  The best part, is when you hear a song that is streaming that you like, you just hit the plus sign and it adds it to your library and then provides you with alternatives you might like as well."
Amazon,The Android App is HORRIBLE.  I'm on verge of uninstalling.  I will also NOT be renewing my Prime Membership.,Carrie Hines,26-Jun-14,1,"I was really excited at first.  As a Prime customer I was thrilled to see I had access to 1 million songs.  And a lot of the songs on offer are right up my alley.  The first day I added over 200 songs to my library.But the Android App is now nearly unusable.  It was great before but now is just horrible. I've been able to listen to maybe five of these songs in the last week as this app is so buggy.  It won't load.  It crashes frequently.  The song pauses every few seconds due to poor, slow streaming quality.  The app is also an enormous resource hog.  It takes up most of the RAM and drains the battery.  My phone can no longer achieve a full charge when plugged into the wall for a few hours and drains to nothing in two hours with minimal or no use at all.  I love that it remains ""running"" when it doesn't even work.The desktop program is tolerable.  It was annoying trying to install flash in chrome and took a long time to set it up but I can live with that.  I cannot tolerate the phone app.  If things don't improve soon I will uninstall it and will also not renew my Prime Membership."
Amazon,Who left the back door open?,khefre,28-Jun-16,2,"Music part works fine, but I do not like the ""Turn on Wi-Fi"" permission. Don't need it, don't want it, can't see a valid reason for it. Uninstalled after I noticed my battery level dropping for no reason. My bad, I didn't read the permissions list."
Amazon,Nice Enough if it Runs on Your Device,Timothy J. Ryan,5-Apr-15,3,"I use this app on my Nexus 7--a Google product--and it doesn't allow me to listen to the Amazon Prime Stations. Not sure this is by spiteful design or simple indifference, but it greatly limits it usefulness to me. IIRC, it wouldn't install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use.  Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations (when I can see them!)."
Amazon,"Too many permissions, Amazon is just too nosey and invasive.",Fox,11-Mar-15,1,"I never even finished installing this bit of spyware, there's no reason they need access to my browser history or my bookmarks.  I pay enough for prime and my music that Amazon doesn't need to be trying to make money from my private info, too. If they ever trim the list down to the things they actually need, I may try again. But as we all know, big companies don't care at all about our privacy or the fact that we're human beings, not ""consumers"", so that won't happen.  If you love the idea of this company keeping track of every little thing you do, then go ahead and install it! Since I cannot use music purchased through Amazon the way I wish, I really need to rethink where I'm spending my money.  Very disappointed in Amazon as a whole, my privacy matters."
Amazon,Great MP3 music player,Stanley Fernandes,13-Dec-12,5,"I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily.  It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player.  Easy interface to use and browse your music.My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album.  I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause.  Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well.  Try listening to Wagner:""The Ring Without Words"" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts.  I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review.  Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other.  I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."
Amazon,DISAPPEARING CONTROLS ?!#?  Need I say more?  How idiotic.,Kakamora,1-Jan-17,1,"DISAPPEARING CONTROLS ?!#?  Need I say more?  How idiotic.  Believe it or not this is not the only Windows program or app I use.  Having controls at the top (iTunes), some at the bottom (Amazon), etc. and then have them disappear so I have to hunt for them by moving the mouse around the screen every time I want to pause, or skip, or ...  WHAT IS THE POINT?  (At least I found a way to turn off the disappearing scroll bar in Microsoft Word.  One down, one-hundred to go).  Please, someone in Development or Design tell me what the benefit is of using disappearing controls?"
Amazon,"Avoid, unless you can't.",Joe Adams,3-Aug-15,1,"This is one of the worst apps on the planet. It lets you buy, but then won't let you use your media card and will fill up your device over and over, even after you move the files. It's a resource hog as one reviewer mentioned, but you don't have a choice if you want to buy on Amazon with your phone. It sucks, but you may have to install, use, uninstall like I have."
Amazon,This is by far the best music product for listening during exercise,Thomas S Snelling,28-Jan-17,5,"This is by far the best music product for listening during exercise, at home while surfing the web and while driving the auto.  Provides pure enjoyment during activities. Easy to navigate with supper music choices and radio stations add free with Prime. The best deal in the industry that I can see. Don't think you will be disappointed."
Amazon,My newest addiction. Love Amazon Prime Music,B&T Luly,19-Feb-16,5,"My newest addiction is amazon prime music. I use the app primarily on my phone. I love the pre-made playlists. Very easy for an indecisive music fan. Just pick what type of music I'm in the mood for, or a band I like, and Amazon does the rest. I stream this in the car, in the office, and in the gym. Tons of free music available through prime. No complaints from me. I've tried  Milk music, Pandora, and other similar apps. I like Amazon music the best."
Amazon,I used to have another subscription for music. I ...,Talderon,4-Apr-17,5,"I used to have another subscription for music. I tried Amazon, but back then (several years ago) there wasn't as much of a selection of my type of music. Now, Amazon Music is all I listen too and few of my family members as well! I really have no complaints and literally use this 365 days a year."
Amazon,Terrible,Robert A.,14-Jul-17,1,"Doesn't work on the echo dot, as the dot can't find an internet connection on the best internet available."
Amazon,Removed after Cloud Limits Enacted,ashertopia,3-May-11,2,"I love the Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. Frankly I had this app frozen on my rooted Droid 2 until Amazon came out with Cloud Player. Now I have a ton of music online and use this player almost exclusively.The main complaint I have is that the Player doesnt remember where I was the last time I ran it. This is a big issue when trying to listen to audio books. Everytime I close the program for a second (hit the home key or switch tasks) I have to remember where I was in the current track. And then when I reopen I (many times) have to scroll to find my album, the tack then click cose to where I was. It is just too hard. Save the last location and I give this a 5 star.UPDATE: When Amazon enacted their limits to songs/ storage or purchase this year I deleted it. Storage is so very cheap now (especially for Amazon, who doesn't have to actually store each song, but only a marker saying we have access to the song) and there are so many competitors (Google Play Music, for instance) I can't justify using this app. I downloaded all my songs (which took almost a day!) then deleted. You've lost me, Amazon MP3, until you give back unlimited storage."
Amazon,No ability to save to external SD card,J. Duesterhoeft,14-Feb-13,2,"I hate to downrate the app to two stars.  Overall, the app is a nice player.  Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music.  The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone.  At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars."
Amazon,Effectively nonfunctional,RayCam,9-Apr-17,1,"Prior versions of this app were uninspired but functional. The current version is so poorly designed as to be nonfunctional. I've moved back to iTunes. Near as I can make out, the net effect of this app - if not the strategic intent - to make using this app to access downloaded and owned music so inconvenient that you just go to Amazon Unlimited streaming instead."
Amazon,A Must for Music Lovers,Jolene Wipf,19-Jul-14,5,Amazon Music with Prime Music is the best application I have ever seen. Customers receive this application as part of their prime membership. The benefits of this program are worth the price of a prime membership. You can listen to almost every artist for free. The albums and playlists that are free have the prime banner on them and show the price as $0.00. I mention this because you want to be careful as the app sneaks in some suggested albums that cost money. Customers can listen to music ad free!!!! Goodbye to other music apps that have annoying commercials. What are you waiting for? Download Amazon Music with Prime Music today!

Love this because of all the  radio different stations and individual playlist that you can make it is fantastic.Sure wish I would have done this sooner. Thanks Amazon
Amazon,Amazon Music is Terrible,Stephen Halpin,23-Nov-16,1,It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music.  If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole.  You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album.  Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time.  It requires you to do that song by song.  Terrible.  I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music.
Amazon,***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***,CL,6-Dec-16,1,"***THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE***1. Doesn't play the majority of the songs I've uploaded.2. Sometimes replaces album art with incorrect ones.3. Sometimes deletes lyrics from various songs (not really relevant since the Amazon Music Player doesn't display lyrics, unless that feature is enabled and then you're left with songs without lyrics)Amazon refuses to play most of my songs that were uploaded to the cloud. These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!"
Amazon,and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be,John Werner,19-Oct-15,3,"As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be.  There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible.  The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one)  does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use.  It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking.  As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from.  That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for.  Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora.  With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song.  This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band???  Here's the bottom line:  If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value)  Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS.  And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud.  They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads.  This is the best part and I like it.  If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers."
Amazon,Horrible performance on Mac Mini - NOT usable - un-install,MapAddict,18-Oct-14,1,"At first was excited to find this app to stream my Amazon music library on my mac. That excitement didn't last long. Takes SO long just to navigate through music. Search is slow and then if you do find the artist/song you're looking for it displays the album art next to it, NOT the one you selected. Beyond that, takes FOREVER just to play a song. Mostly takes up CPU and spins. I've got a super fast internet connection too, so that's not it.Sadly I had to go back to the browser just to play my library, and that user interface is even more clunky. And JUST FINDING MY MUSIC LIBRARY was nearly impossible. Easy to find Prime video, prime music, but SO HARD to find my own music I own.If performance for this app ever did get fixed, it sure would be cool to have an Android app to access and play my library like a remote control. Ever cooler to have an iTunes-like visualizer."
Amazon,fun app to use to discover new music,Amazon Customer,2-Jul-17,4,"Amazing and fun app to use to discover some new music. I feel like there is still too much crude AI use in selecting music however, and the mediocre music selection/dj'ing can  dull the experience."
Amazon,"Good service, but...",Anonymous,12-Aug-15,4,"I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes, but I think maybe I need to use it more. The only reason it's not 5 star is because they don't have a whole lot of new using available to listen to for Prime memebers. Otherwise in an are where I have internet, the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good."
Amazon,Just stay away from this expensive data and battery hog.,Sunrise,9-Feb-16,1,"First: This works fine on my computer, and I like it.Second, there is a very big ""but"": not only was it gobbling half my battery life with the phone app - all while not being used - that it doesn't do what it must do if it's a phone app. Namely, work on my wifi. I thought that suddenly my the battery on my phone must be weakening. It is not.In order to download the music that belongs to you or use the player services it provides, you have to allow it to get on your phone's internet . It refuses to use wifi. This is bizarre, but what the hey. I downloaded my purchases and thought everything was fine. Come to find out, I'd used 1GB of data that I didn't even know about. Now, what is that? Then I got busy and forgot to look into it. I haven't used the player in the last week, and now my phone service is notifying me that I've used ANOTHER 1 GB of data!?! What in the world is it doing to use that much. Lucky for me I have a big plan, or I'd be paying now.Amazing. Update: I logged out to stop it (there is no off button and you can't get it to leave your notifications or stand down otherwise), and now it's got a pop up asking me to log in that you can't get out of by pressing the back button. Amazon can forget it. I'm not logging in and out when I want to play music."
Amazon,Amazon Fan but this app is useless!,Amazon Fan,24-Aug-15,1,"This app was never very functional but with the latest update it became unusable. I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a  prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"
Amazon,WTF,Roberta Branca,30-May-17,1,"I am trying to understand the logic behind this ""free music"" app marketed to people who already pay you a $100 per year. Are you completely unaware that we can already stream music for free elsewhere without a subscription of any kind? ""Stored on a cloud"" simply means ""we control all of your access to music you purchased"". I am not going to renew our Prime subscription next year. So far our is just a gateway to additional monthly fees."
Amazon,Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime,Bruce,9-Nov-17,2,"Though I like the concept of Amazon music with prime, this app leaves a bit to be desired. Specifically it is really slow. I have around 3000 songs on my Galaxy S7. It can take upwards of a minute to change screens. Once I have reached the album, playlist or artist I am searching for, it plays just fine."
Amazon,"Good User Interface, and quickly growing selection.",Will Spaeth,8-Jul-16,5,"I really like Amazon Music.  I've been using it for about 6 months and it's finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It doesn't have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they've been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.Also, I'm really happy they've been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta.  Can't wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.One thing I'd really like to see is a higher bit rate option.  I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is.Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs weren't designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."
Amazon,Those services are terrible. Amazon,raymond Garceau,18-Nov-15,1,"Amazon needs to do some serious fixing on their digital media. I tried music for the first time after getting a prompt that im only using 2 services What happens with my first experience? ""Try again Later""  Yes thats what I wanted to see. Same applies to movies. Took two attempts and at least a half hour to get a movie to play. Last time I tried to watch a movie it was telling me I couldnt watch it in HD, ""not enough bandwidth"" I have 60 meg bandwidth router 10 ft from TV.  Those services are terrible. Amazon. Renewal Im thinking not."
Amazon,"Amazon Music, is another shining example of the rich features afforded the members of Amazon Prime.",John R. Bunnell,5-Oct-17,5,"I was skeptical of this application and just what music I could get as an Amazon Prime member. I was pleasantly surprised at all the well thought out features and the wide selection of music from all genres . I have an MP3 player and I plan to load it with music from my play lists in Amazon Music. For us Baby Boomers, we can listen to and enjoy all the legendary mucic of our time."
Amazon,"Thanks, Amazon!",Amazon customer,3-Jan-16,5,"What an awesome benefit of being a Prime member!  Music creates a time line through our lives.  Hearing certain songs take you back to great times, so much so, that you feel through association that you are there.Getting around the Amazon Music app is very easy and intuitive.  If you invest a little time, you can create a great playlist of songs that you love. Amazon....Thanks for including this with the Prime membership!"
Amazon,Pitiful Really.,Mark Judice,13-Nov-16,1,"I'm fairly computer literate and this is a painful application/service to use. This is especially true if you have a large library to upload to the cloud. I'm talking weeks of babysitting this thing to get them there.Also, the app is very slow to respond when scrolling around in My Library. There should be a local index so this doesn't happen. Of course, the Store browsing works reasonably well since they only have tiny web pages (a couple of screens long).This service is a valuable component to the Alexa universe. Pleeeeeze, Get it right. It honestly seems like Amazon really doesn't want you to use your music you already own, in favor of a streaming service. It may be fine for some, but personally, I don't want Amazon feeding me music via streaming. I want MY music. Think about this.... What if your parents told you what was popular and you had to stream from that."
Amazon,Nifty music app.,Rob P.,21-Sep-15,4,"The good:No adsLarge selection overallDoesn't cut off the last 15 seconds of music (an issue Pandora has never bothered to fix)The bad:Some genres are rather sparse (in particular heavy metal and alternative)pausing songs for more than a couple of minutes causes the app to replay the song from scratch or shut down altogetherThe search function really needs some work. I have had better luck searching in my browser than I have in the app from my phone.In total, this has become the music app of choice for me."
Amazon,Love this better than any other,Bren,1-Jul-16,5,I have used other options for my music. Amazon music is the best so far! I  love that I get digital copies of my purchases immediately  and can enjoy the music before I recieve my actual CD. I  live that with Prime I can share my Amazon options with my household!! I just love Amazon! I used to be an eBay customer but Prime offers so many benefits that the competition can't compare. Having Amazon music on top of all the other great Amazon products just makes it sweeter!
Amazon,This app is great when it works,Boomer,23-May-17,2,"This app is great when it works.  However, in the last few months it is constantly freezing after playing only a few songs (offline) and recently in the last few weeks, it will either not launch my library or it will hang up before a song loads to start playing.  It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable.If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally.  I expect so much better from Amazon.  Maybe Wal-Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works."
Amazon,Junk,Hard2Please,10-Jul-16,1,"It's a waste of time out of the gate on my android phone.  I bought a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts while I'm mowing the lawn.The podcast is already on my phone.I open Amazon music, which is supposed to play music on the device and voila, it does.  It plays through the speaker on the device.I attach the headset and, uh, no.  No audio.  I can see it playing, I can hear the volume go up and down as it makes a ding each time I adjust the volume.I screw around and waste 20 minutes pairing and unpairing, looking at settings, nothing fixes it so I toss it on the bed and mow my lawn with nothing but the voices in my head to occupy my time.I come back in and install BlackPlayer.  It works flawlessly out of the box.Amazon how how much money to blow on development and you can't stream audio to a bluetooth headset in 2016?Here's some advice.  My data will never live in your cloud.  Stop designing poor apps thinking it will."
Amazon,"Awesome, better than any music streaming I have used ...",Logan,21-Jul-17,5,"Awesome, better than any music streaming I have used to date on any platform. Lets you listen to individual songs, or stations, and has the thumbs up/down feature also. Seriously the best one I have used. And I tried a bunch."
Amazon,Makes working more enjoyable!,Silvr Craze,27-Aug-15,5,Having Amazon Prime now I decided to check out the music.  The playlists are awesome!  I am so happy to tap a list and get to working now rather than search for a station on another app that is playing something good.  I can choose a Playlist that I like and the majority of the music is still what I like.  I do wish it could do a predictive play from previously played and/or downloaded songs.  As long as I am connected to wifi the app plays smoothly.
Amazon,I am supposed to be able to hear a bunch ...,Deborah Kovac,2-Mar-17,3,"I am supposed to be able to hear a bunch of it for free, but its difficult to get around in or even to set a group of songs to play one after the other so I can get work done & not come back every 3 to 4 minutes to put on the next song."
Amazon,Worth it.,John Hammernik,26-Sep-17,4,"Easy to use, large variety of genres and artists make Amazon Music worth it. Ability to download is also a plus. I wish artists/songs didn't disappear at random but they are replaced by new ones so it's a bit of a wash. Overall a thumbs up."
Amazon,I really do like this app,Jennifer K.,19-Sep-16,4,"I really do like this app. I personally find it simple to use although some might find it a bit cumbersome. I do like the fact that I can choose between my personal library and the Amazon Prime library. The only thing I wish were different is the fact that there are some songs and artists I can absolutely not find. This is probably due to song/album/artist rights and more of an artists choice than an Amazon issue, but it's still a bummer."
Amazon,We Love Amazon's Music Service!!!!,The VA Gift Gallery,5-Jul-15,5,"I've used several electronic streaming TV and music services and Amazon by far blows them ALL out of the water. I rarely have trouble with streaming/buffering issues and I've downloaded it on my computers and mobile phone. The ability to setup playlists for various genres or family members is awesome and I plan on using this for my outdoor speaker system that I also plan to purchase on Amazon. Prime membership is worth every dime with all of the features you receive including the streaming music service. Amazon is my ""go to"" place when it comes to online shopping and entertainment. A+++++"
Amazon,It was great until the most recent update,me,2-Mar-17,3,"It was great until the most recent update.  Using it was always difficult but the access to the library of albums and music was fantastic, now it is not. I was enjoying listening to albums and songs, creating more playlists, etc. and now it doesn't provide any entertainment unless I subscribe monthly.  I am going back to my IPOD."
Amazon,Not worth the headache,Candice,21-Jun-16,1,"Uninstalled.  It just removes music that you bought through them, the cloud storage is a joke as it is constantly rescanning, songs bought and saved to my sd card don't show up or just won't play.  The prime music is not a good deal, as the songs are just removed with no warning (kills whatever Playlist it lives in with it).  I play games, videos and other Internet intensive apps with no issue. Amazon plays two songs from MY device and still manages to skip and refuse to play.  Utter garbage.  No customer support either.  Just one maddening phone call after another that translates to 'got your money, sucka!'  Officially done."
Amazon,The app is very  easy to use.,Kasaundra,29-Sep-15,5,"Out of all of the different music playing apps that I have had on my phone, I like this one the best. It's really easy to search for songs and load them to my playlist. It's easy to switch between my different playlists. Additionally, almost every cd that I have purchased (from Amazon) was automatically added to my collection of music, as an added surprise.  There are also Amazon Station and cloud storage but I have not tried those quite yet."
Amazon,"New Amazon policy, crap on your customers",Philip Amoroso,13-Oct-16,1,Forced new update is a complete disaster.  Horrible interface that take more time/work to get anything done.  Tons of music I never uploaded to the app is now there that I have to go through to make my playlists.  I love that if I contact Amazon to complain and ask to go back to the old app their only answer is that you can't once you've installed it.  That's nice except for I didn't install it.  I'll have to see if I can get my music onto my echo with some other program or through it in the trash where it belongs now that this garbage has been forced on me.
Amazon,"Best music app that I have found so far, and I have used far too many. Easy to use, easy to understand.",Josephine (Josie)  Grounds,11-Dec-15,5,"Every morning I start my day choosing whether to download new music, play my playlist, or listening to a channel. Throughout the day, I know that no matter what I am planning on doing, there is music that fits, whether Ska, Classic, Rock, Pop, Country, everything in one place. I've had different online music programs, some I pay for, some free, and this one is the very best that I have come across.I can listen across all my devices without having to make a new playlist each and every time just by signing into my account."
Amazon,Used to be pretty Good,M. Reilly,27-Jun-14,1,"The app in its former life as the MP3 app was very good - at least 4 stars.  The new version is only worth 1 star.  What is most annoying is that whenever I startup the app it spams me with a full screen ad for Prime music with no obvious way to get to my music.  I thought this trick was reserved for malware.  I finally discovered that pushing the back ""button"" twice quickly on my device  I could get to my music.  This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for (either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime) is supposed to behave.  I really wish there was an alternative app."
Amazon,"I used to love, now I hate it.",Richard T. Moore,2-Feb-17,1,"I used to love Amazon Music and would recommend it to everyone; not anymore.This app has become so buggy it's almost unusable. It will just stay running in the background for hours despite closing it multiple times.With Android Auto... OH My GOD it's awful!  I can only access Recently Played, Recommended Stations, and a couple of other avenues that Amazon tries to force feed me. I have no way to browse the THOUSANDS of songs I purchased THROUGH AMAZON. I can't access My Playlists, nothing. If I unplug the phone, go to the playlist, artist, or song I want and then start playing it, I can then plug it into my car and listen to that, and ONLY that selection. Obviously, that's not ideal when you're trying to drive.I just want to be able to play all the songs on my phone in my car, why is that too much to ask?"
Amazon,Good for tracks purchased on Amazon but has one Flaw.,Lui,27-Aug-16,3,"Tried it out for a couple of weeks and it was great i can stream all my purchased tracks with great quality, But the main problem i had was when i uploaded some of my music it changed all of the cover art and i could not change it back i tried everything i could so that it didn't but it kept doing it so i just stopped using it that was the deal breaker for me."

My personal music that I uploaded into my cloud (and pay $25 a year to do so) has half the songs not playing correctly. The app doesn't respond well on the Fire Stick, and on my car iPod (a 5th gen), the app is so slow and buggy, and my personal uploads play maybe 40% of the time. Also, WHY can't we sort out playlist music alphabetically!? I am seriously considering a massive switch from Amazon Digital services!"
Amazon,Disappointing on Android,Antillus,7-Jan-14,1,"I have a Galaxy Note 3, and no matter what I did I could not get this app to properly install, nor work.At one point I got the widget installed, but when I would touch the widget all that would happen would be that a grey screen flashes and then you're right back to where you started.When installing other apps, like from the Play Store, after the installation there are usually two buttons presented; ""open"" and ""uninstall"". With this app, however, those buttons are ghosted over so you can't open the app even if you wanted to.No luck finding it in the applications folder either..I'm so disappointed because I have so much music hosted on Amazon, but can't even get it to play when i really need it to."
Amazon,"Very difficult, waste a lot of time",star,8-Jul-17,1,Difficult to use music that you purchased with other apps on your devices. I have wasted so much time trying to download my songs on my device and not just within this app.
Amazon,So far I am satisfied with the Amazon music app,3xBlessed,18-Oct-16,5,So far I am satisfied with the Amazon music app. I just signed up for prime. I was able to find all the music I love. I also downloaded them for offline play. It's great being able to listen to your favorite songs without using mobile data when you aren't on wifi.
Amazon,"""All 90's"" pfft! Lies!",christopher b. hermosura,1-Jun-17,1,"Have you listened to the All 90's station on this app? They lied! It's not ALL 90's it's basically 90's Alternative with  little bits and pieces of other genres sprinkled in. And I swear I hear the same songs over and over and over and over and over again. It even gets to the point where I'm not even surprised anymore. When I first started listening to this station, I would hear songs and think, ""Wow, I haven't heard this in a while"". Now, they seem to play the same 10-20 songs, and I think, ""Oh, this again."". Come on now! If you're going to call this station ""All 90's"", play ALL 90's music."
Amazon,Decent for just launching.,Amanda Schultz,1-Jan-17,3,"Ok so I've used another music app for a long time.Things that could use some adjusting...Opening the app after closing you can't go to the list you were just listening to.There is no ""play next option""  you have to physically move it which can get crazy trying to scroll up and down.I want to be able to see main controls (play,  skip,  pause, etc) from any screen,  while I am browsing for other music.Get these right and I could completely  switch."
Amazon,Great way to listen to music you want to hear,CTDragon,14-Mar-15,5,"Great way to listen to music you want to hear. You add music to your library and listen to it. It seems to be a web player like Pandora, but unlike Pandora,  it's not a radio player. It looks like there's a way to pre-load songs if you go on a trip, which is great. I will continue to check it out. Best of all there seems to be a random button for all songs in your library without creating a playlist. You have no idea how many devs overlook that feature in music players. It's a deal breaker for me not to have that option."

Amazon,"Mediocre interface, frustrating glitches, and limited library",Forum,5-Jul-15,2,"The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I donÛªt need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. YouÛªd think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players donÛªt seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."
Amazon,CRASH - CRASH - CRASH,Kelvin Brown,3-Nov-16,1,CRASH - CRASH - CRASH.Every time I try to upload new music the darn thing just crashes.  This is not the first time Amazon has used their customers to beta test a new product before it is ready for Prime time.  When they do that I start mistaking them for Apple Music.  I don't know where to even get help or who to e-mail to register a complaint.  Grrrrrrrr.
Amazon,"When it works, it's good; WHEN it works.",b2b4,9-Jun-15,2,"I really am trying to like this service, but it's always crapping out on me. It will start playing a track, but with out any audio. Then the audio *might* come on, but when it goes to the next track ÛÒ if it does at all ÛÒ it's often silent again. Or, it may happily play several tracks, and then crap out again. Needless to say, this ""free"" service for Prime members is as they say, what you pay for. I'm going to give Apply Music a try when it's released."
Amazon,The idea of having a mobile app is to be ...,Pete from Fl.,26-Jul-17,2,"The idea of having a mobile app is to be able to use it on the go. This was something that overlook completely by the developer. The UL is way too complex. You should be able to click the app icon and within one or two taps be able to play your music. NO, you have to scroll down past the banner ad  on the home page just to realize that what you were just listening to on your desktop is not there. Okay lets try the recent button,..Nope not that one. wait the added tab? No.. OK back to home screen, No, I don't know ! I'll close the app and listen to radio or CD on the drive home.Now if you have the time and are willing to spend it exploring this app; it does have all the features of the the desktop version and is quit robust, again not very mobile friendly ."

Amazon,"Fix two things, and I'm in for 4-5 stars",G. D. Young,31-May-14,1,"Phone: Nexus 5, 32GB.1) 99% of the time, I use Amazon MP3 to play my Amazon Cloud songs. I generally list items by Album. Well, when I finish listening to an album, go back to the album list and try to play another, it NEVER works. It just hangs. So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."
Amazon,Underwhelmed by Amazon,Robert H Stamper Jr,21-Jun-16,1,"Amazon allowed me to purchase additional upload space for 250k songs, I uploaded about 20k.  They can not provide a good user experience with this many songs.  Looks like I will have to cancel and find another service.  One good example is that I can consistently try to download an album i uploaded and every time it crashes the app.  It is constantly laggy and trying to update even though there are no updates to my music library.  It often hangs or crashes for unknown reasons.  Amazing that one of the largest tech compaines in the world can't build and app that is not more stable than this."

I have a Prime subscription, which let's me download and play songs offline, but with the latest update every Prime song (ie - ones you didn't buy directly) needs to hit the internet or it won't play. This stops your playlists/albums with mixed songs dead, or they won't play at all if all Prime. Forget about listening on the subway or anywhere else without an internet connection. Such a garbage move. Yet another example of a change that benefits the vendor and screws the consumer."

Amazon,How do you stop this thing?,Bob Pagani,18-Feb-14,3,"On every operating thing on Earth there is a way to start and stop it.  Having just had many songs put on my Motorola Razor Max phone, I discovered that if I tire of listening to music, YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF!  THERE'S NO STOP BUTTON.  It'll run in the background forever, but short of turning off the phone, there's no ""Hush"" button.  If this is so that some 14 year olds don't have to wait more than two seconds to get back to their.........music, please understand that my vote counts, too.Other than that, the features seem to work with little second-guessing, although I'm still new to this.  More to follow."
Amazon,Avoid!!!,Andrew S.Tate,23-Aug-16,1,This program is trash.  Even after telling it to download your music it still requires an internet connection and streaming to use.

Amazon,Best Place To Buy Digital Music,MnM,11-Jun-15,4,"Prime music is the best place to purchase digital music.  Unlike iTunes which only makes purchases available to my iTunes library, Prime will place downloads in both my iTunes and Windows Media Player libraries.  We've found that prices for digital music is better, on average, than iTunes too -- at least on my PC.  If they could figure out a way to put downloaded purchased music in my iTunes library on my iOS devices that would make it even better.  But for now I'll just have to live with syncing my devices with my PC.I also wish the selection of streaming music on Amazon was better.  This is one place where iTunes and their radio service has Amazon beat.One thing that makes Amazon and their Prime Music service stand out from the rest is when we get free digital copies added to our prime library when we purchase CDs on Amazon.  Now I don't have to wait for the CD to arrive and rip it to get it on my portable devices.  Sometimes you can find albums for sale at a cheaper price on CD than if you buy the download only version.I also like the streaming Prime music library.  It's like listening to the radio and we can eventually purchase the songs we like so they can be played offline or after they are removed.  I suppose this will be treated like the Prime Instant Video service where tunes that were once included with our Prime membership will suddenly become purchase only.  If I could count on my favorite songs being available later it would make me less likely to think twice before renewing my Prime membership."
Amazon,DONT UPDATE 2014 new Amazon Music App even worse than itunes now! No stars!!! Useless awful bad design!,Mr. Robert O. Randall,18-Jun-14,1,This abomination only gets one star as it is a minimum requirement to be reviewed. I wrote to Amazon 7 months ago to praise their Amazon music player app as a superior alternative to the abomination that is ios 7 itunes.Sadly the new Music app is packed with the same type of retrogressive time wasting bad design as apple are so fond of.Thankfully I have been able to delete the new amazon app and replace it with the old one.I will however be looking for alternatives to theirr system from this moment on.
Amazon,Ah Fiddlesticks! Something just went wrong. Please restart Amazon Music,Mieka Coy,13-Oct-15,1,"Apparently - ""Ah Fiddlesticks!"" - ""Something just went wrong. Please restart Amazon Music"" - is the logo and tagline for Amazon Prime Music.We (tried) to move our home music library to the Amazon Prime Music cloud - including the added $25.00 annually for more storage.  The concept is great and as our family enjoys Amazon Prime features on the Roku I expected a similar experience with their Prime Music offering.  Sadly the Amazon Prime Music customer experience is terrible primarily because of the constant (>20 times daily) app/system crashes. And when it does run it's SLLOOOOOOOOWWWW.  We have tried numerous times to download our library to the Amazon cloud that too has crashed on us several times.  We have high-speed network access at home but tried also from the office to see if we had a different experience.  Nope!When calling in for customer support I was told to set all Streaming Cache and Audio Quality to minimum.  Guess what... No change.I expect Amazon will - eventually - get this all fixed but I wouldn't recommend anyone make the investment and migration yet. For now I'd strongly recommend you all stick to Spotify & Apple Music."
Amazon,Some songs do not have the right Lycris,Levi knott,11-Nov-15,5,Please update the Lycris to this song http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/safetysuit/neverstop.html yes only one part is incorrect but still this has been my girls an I song for 3 years and I was very unhappy when I saw something incorrect check the sources that you got the Lycris they are completely wrong the part I'm talking about (I will not look the other way) but on this app it says (I want to look the other way) flaws in the developers part not Amazon!
Amazon,"Has many good titles, but search engine is not reliable",bassguy66,20-Nov-15,2,"Not a very intuitive app. Has many good titles, but search engine is not reliable, input titles or artist names and get ""nothing found"" message, then the same titles or artist show up under a different search for something else. Have spent hours downloading tracks to device for listening off line, only to have the whole library disappear from my device without warning. Amazon is a great place to buy items but their customer service & tech support are nonexistent."
Amazon,It would be difficult to make a worse app,Sappy,11-Feb-17,1,"The old Amazon MP3 app from years ago was great.  Then, when Amazon integrated streaming... apparently somebody somewhere at Amazon decided that it would be wise to do that by making their music app as much of an unwieldy basket case as possible.  Over the past few years, it's only grown progressively worse.  It's like a schizophrenic mishmash with poor organization, and as counter-intuitive as possible.I've always bought my digital music on Amazon, but between this extremely poorly thought out app, and the fact that one has to be very careful wading through multiple ""tribute"" band titles when shopping for any music to find the music you actually want rather than ""tribute"" band crap... I'm just done with buying my music on Amazon."
Amazon,Uh oh...regretting downloading the 3.0.2 update.,Ohio Chris,9-Dec-13,1,"I used to really like this app, however the most recent update (3.0.2) is not good at all.  It seems to have removed the ""lock screen"" controls, which was really the reason I used this app.  Looks like I'll be migrating over to another music player, which is a shame as I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem and that's where I was getting most of my music.  I'm totally regretting downloading this update and am considering looking online to see if anyone has the old version so I can go back.  PLEASE AMAZON, FIX THIS!UPDATE 12-12-13: There was an update that fixed a few minor issues but still did not bring back the lock screen controls.  And now, when using the Amazon mp3 app, some of my songs cut off half-way through for no reason.  Really frustrating.  I've now migrated over to GoneMAD Music Player.  It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old (working) version of Amazon mp3, but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call.  It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless.  Let's be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service.  And I understand that and was OK with it.  I'll use your store...just give me an app that has some halfway decent features and works and we're good.  You had that, but now the app is bunk.  Just maddening.  I'll upgrade my rating when the app at least returns the features that were there before the update."
Amazon,"Good app,",Knobson D'Mong,15-May-17,4,"Good music app, just wish it would be easier to view and play ""similar"" songs or ""radios"" when playing a current song or tune from "" my music""."
Amazon,This app blows.,Kristen McQuinn,19-Feb-15,1,"This app blows. It constantly freezes or skips, it's always buffering or ""syncing your Cloud library."" If you can get it to play songs, you'd better not even think about hitting the skip button, because you'll get stuck buffering and loading and freezing all over again. It works terribly on the Fire Stick, doing the same crap as on my phone, though the functionality on my phone is way worse. I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, and it didn't even load all of my music back into the cloud, including Prime music I'd added to playlists.I had hoped the app would let me listen to the tons of music I've purchased from Amazon, and for it to be a friendlier alternative to iTunes, which I dislike on principle. It is entirely frustrating when I can't listen smoothly even at home, with strong wifi, on Amazon's own devices and apps. I hope it gets updated soon, because this is unacceptable."
Amazon,App crashes on my phone almost daily & I never use it,CDR,25-Oct-17,1,"I never use it but it crashes regularly (typically once a day) on my andoid phone, locking/slowing my phone to the point that I have to reboot it. I'd like to uninstall or disable but haven't figured out how to do it. Regular Prime user, I use Amazon all the time but this app is driving me crazy."
Amazon,DO NOT USE JUST GO TO ITUNES,Aaron Wilson,19-Mar-17,1,Why use iTunes when you can buy music here that it wont let you download and then still have to buy the same song again on iTunes to get it to a slide show. Terrible interface that would not let me download the song I purchased and not easy to use. Might as well give this sector up Amazon you'll never make it in the music delivery business. This is why people turn to youtubetomp3converter and other file ripping sites!!!!!!
Amazon,Budget Music Service,Sono,10-Jul-15,2,"I guess this service would be okay if you were only interested in the latest pop & country music, but it doesn't seem to be of much use if you're looking to hear anything from specific bands like Metallica, Pantera and Credence Clearwater Revival.I was looking into whether this could replace my Pandora subscription, but the limited music selection, horrendous UI and seemingly never ending series of menus were enough to make me realize that this particular piece of the Amazon prime membership wasn't quite as good as the video on demand and 2-day shipping."
Amazon,Useful app,Glenda M,6-Sep-16,4,"I apparently need this to play the music I have in the Amazon cloud, so I got the app. It's complicated and a bit confusing to me (young folks probably have no issue with it at all). It seems to use up an awful lot of storage space to just play my oldies music."
Amazon,No commercials,L. B.,14-Jun-16,5,I used to always listen to Pandora. However Amazon Prime Music has been replacing Pandora. Prime Music has no commercials. Prime Music is easy to use also.
Amazon,The one that works best!,Catsissie,25-Apr-16,5,"I downloaded the Amazon app store so I could get this as an Android app for my phone. I have the Music Player subscription and wanted to have my tunes with me--the ""other"" well-known player caused many of my songs to disappear, and the free Amazon app never did that. So, of course, I put them on my computer version of this player. The phone version works as well as the computer one--since this was my first smartphone, I wasn't sure what to expect. Shouldn't have worried. Always go with what you know works best!"
Amazon,There are 2 things that bother me. 1) I ...,Jim Marshall,15-Jun-17,4,There are 2 things that bother me. 1) I am not sure if songs or albums cost until I see a payment issued. 2) It takes a little while to get to the music.
Amazon,Worse than useless,William A. Levinson,10-Aug-15,1,"To: Two Steps from Hellcc: Amazon.comI placed an order for your excellent album Battlecry on Amazon.com, but I will cancel my purchase because I cannot download your music without AmazonÛªs Music App. It shoves the files somewhere onto my computer where I cannot find them, and I will never purchase any music from Amazon.com again.Can you recommend a seller other than Amazon with comparable prices? I would like to buy your music, but not through a seller that puts obstacles in front of the customer.--BillActually, it turns out that you can download the tracks you purchased one at a time, which shows just how incompetent the people who developed it are. To download the 20 plus tracks I purchased, I had to click my mouse 20 times instead of once. Where does Amazon find these people??? In fact, http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201377790""To download albums or multiple tracks at one time, you need to use Amazon Music for PC and Mac. However if you don't have the app installed on your computer, you can still download songs one-by-one from your music library: "" In other words, Amazon knows about the defect but has not taken closed loop corrective action--a hallmark of poor quality, and not caring about the job."
Amazon,Annoying notifications prevent me from giving this 5 stars,Geob1,2-Feb-16,2,"The app works fine, though it's not always obvious how to do some things. My #1 complaint is that the Amazon developers of this app are LAZY. They assume that certain devices do not have Google Services installed, instead of actually detecting if they are installed. So despite the fact the app works fine on my phone, I get around 8 to 10 ""notifications"" every day on my phone telling me the app is not supported on my device because it doesn't support Google Services. Really? Then why did I recently get an Update from Google to my Google Services? Duh! My Google Maps and Google Play related apps wouldn't work if I didn't have them. Your app works fine on my phone, but I may have to uninstall it just to stop the annoying notifications. Do a little detection please or provide a way to turn off the notifications!"
Amazon,Isn't this supposed to be included with my Prime account?,Gypsy Diva,20-Aug-17,3,Why am I being charged $9/month? I thought it was included in my Prime account. Also why do songs keep disappearing from my playlist?
Amazon,The best thing is most of it is completely free and ...,Rachel Trieu,5-Feb-15,5,"Wow! IMO, this is the one big thing that Prime was missing and now, membership is completely worth it with this feature. I am a HUGE music fanatic on the Amazon Student Prime trial and this has been the highlight of it. Since they recently added the ability to stream whatever I want AND add it to my library, I am ecstatic! I thought there had to be a catch, but lo and behold, I clicked the songs I wanted and saved them to my offline library. I'm excited because I do not have to worry about any viruses on my phone, etc, because all of these albums and songs are found in the Prime library and they have EVERYTHING, and I mean, EVERYTHING. They have 3 seasons of Victorious soundtracks, 150 songs by Veggietales and of course, music everyone actually listens to (Top 40, EDM and even some Indie Rock).The best thing is most of it is completely free and it is so easy to use. I think the previous reviews were outdated because it is extremely user friendly. Just make sure you check if the songs are free or not, there is an option to search only Prime eligible so that rules out any costs. But like I said, the majority are free and you'd expect them to be like 1-star freebies, but nope, you have the Pharell, Vance Joy and Meghan Trainor album available.My only qualm is that the ""genres"" aren't exactly accurate. They definitely need to make an Indie category instead of classifying MGMT as EDM lol and they classified Sara Bareilles as Rock. Ha. But not enough for me to take away a star. I am a highly satisfied customer! Haven't had any problems besides when I download a few too many albums at a time, then it crashes once in a while, but I see that more as my problem and impatience for downloading so much, than the app. I wondered how this would benefit them at all but I realized a lot of people would probably be more willing to stick with their Prime memberships (I probably will) and some of the songs that are able to purchase make you WANT to purchase them because everything else is free.**Again, keep in mind this is written in the perspective of someone who currently has an Amazon Prime Membership, which has made it completely worth it! I have never used it otherwise, this is just based on the update. Thanks :)"
Amazon,this app works perfect on my LG tablet so I would give it ...,Joselujano84,27-Jan-15,1,"(for the 4.3 update) ok... this app works perfect on my LG tablet so I would give it 5 stars if i just wanted to use it there but 99 percent of the time I want to use it on my phone... AN AMAZON FIRE PHONE!!!! and guess what? I can't install it on my amazon fire phone! This is similar to the way it worked on my iphone. This is the app I wanted. You click a song and it plays. SIMPLE. I dont want to add it to a library. There are too many songs I am curious to hear but may not want to hear ever again. This is a five star app but i cant install it on amazons fire phone... BACKUP YOUR FLAGSHIP PHONE, AMAZON!"
Amazon,Want the old player back.,Trisha Miller,4-Dec-16,1,"Well, I used to like your player.  This new version is the most irritating app I can imagine.  You want me to upload all of my library to the cloud in order for me to add it to my playlists?  The playlists that were full and set up how I wanted, and are now depopulated?  And for some reason, it takes ages to upload a single song?Screw this app.  Just like iTunes and Mediaplayer before it, I'll ditch it for an app that plays music, and leaves my play lists alone."
Amazon,really? ??,Joseph Radico,19-Jun-15,1,"Dose this app truly need access to most if not all of my phone features?  Why dose it need to access my phone log? And contacts.  I also find it's complicated to download song. I have prime and wanted to take advantage of all its features,  why wouldn't i for 99 dollars a year. But its a bit too invasive.  I uninstalled it. Maybe if it didnt need to access so much i would of kept it. Back to Pandora i guess. Maybe next time Amazon thanks but no thanks. I felt violated."
Amazon,Actively getting worse,Jeff Jochum,19-Aug-15,2,"Amazon's music player is actively getting worse with each update.  It's pretty intolerable now.  There are three primary problems I've been having with this app on my HTC One M8:1.  The repeat feature for individual songs is straight up broken.  Songs will often repeat with no audio, but continue to stream.  Makes this feature worthless, I got to go find the song in my cache folder and play it with another app.2.  Uploading an album is terrible, since Amazon will often treat artists on the album as being in separate albums, resulting in me having multiple albums defined on my cloud, each made up of only the partial album I actually wanted organized.3.  I used to get by this fine by just searching for the name of the album on the search function and playing out the results.  This doesn't seem to work anymore as it ONLY plays whatever song I select off the results window, despite there being multiple results.  This app is currently doing its best to dissuade me from playing songs by album.I'm not normally finicky about stuff, but for some reason the mobile market really struggles with basic music player functionality.  This app really highlights the problems in this market."
Amazon,"Once my favorite player, now it's junk.",Greymon,26-Dec-13,1,"I really liked Amazon MP3 up until this latest update. The reason I liked it more than any other player is that if I was in the car, or anything else, and had the app on screen, I could just tap my screen to pause the music. I don't care if my music downloads to my device, I can move that to my SD, no problem. However, now if I want to pause my music while I'm driving, I have to look at my phone, and I don't like doing that. I've switched back to the pre-installed player and unless Amazon puts this function back into their app, the 1 star rating will remain and I'll continue to use the pre-installed player while Amazon MP3 stays in uninstalled useless app purgatory."
Amazon,Please fix issues,Michell,23-Mar-16,3,"I do like the ability of getting music w/my Prime acct. That said there are a few time that need to be changed in order to make it better. First allow the app &/or music to be saved to the SD card.  When my phone updated to marshmallow it wiped all my music (whether this is an Android or Amazon issue idk), but everything on my SD card was saved. Second, make it easier to download music. I can't afford to burn through my data, streaming music. Last (again going back to marshmallow update), make sure your app is compatible w/the newest upgrade. Since marshmallow I can't update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache & data from both Prime & Google Play Store. This means I need to uninstall the app and will loose all my music on my device because I can't save it to my SD card. If I'm suppose to be able to receive music because I pay for a service I should have the ability to download and save"
Amazon,Not a fan!,D-M-W,19-May-17,1,Too hard to bumble about with.  And not sure if it has been purchased or just listened to.  I have to stick with my Apple products on this stuff....sorry.
Amazon,Take it Global!,Ethan Morgan,29-Apr-17,4,Needs to be able to be used in more countries on my phone. Other than that it's just pandora which is a huge compliment. I love the product and hope to be able to use it globally soon!
Amazon,Love using it,Boettcher,14-Jul-17,4,"Love using it. If you are a Prime Member it's worth the monthly fee. If you are not a Prime Member, stick with Spotify for the same price."
Amazon,What is this even for!?,B.A. Customer,27-Dec-16,1,"Not really sure what the point of this app is.  I have Amazon Prime, and heard I was supposed to be able to use free streaming music...  This application doesn't appear to be associated with that, assuming its even true.  However, this application doesn't appear to do anything.  I can look up artists and albums, but there is no available option to purchase, play(not even a demo), or download the music."
Amazon,You broke the app,Tyler,20-Jun-14,1,"The Amazon MP3 App used to run perfectly on my HTC One (M8). Now, everything is incredibly unresponsive, I can't access my offline music in areas where I have no service, and upon advancing to the next track, it takes about 5-7 seconds for the song information to update once the next song starts playing. Also, I used to enjoy being able to swipe my finger from right to left to go to the next song, but you've ruined that too by causing a dialog box to come up every time you touch the album art. I've cancelled my yearly cloud subscription and will be looking elsewhere to enjoy my music. You've destroyed a perfectly good app in what appears to be an attempt to make more money. Congratulations on being counter-intuitive and letting the consumer know they are important as long as they keep their mouths shut and give you money."
Amazon,Intrusive app,Gillou,19-Feb-12,1,"This app requires access to my private phone logs, phone call history and status.Is it really necessary for a mp3 store interface ?I chose not to install this app because of this."
Amazon,"Needs Serious Work, Resource Hog from Cloud",Robert Brown,30-Apr-15,3,"I've tried this on both the iPod Touch (5th gen) and a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (n8013). The latter has a near top-of-the-line processor (still), 2gb of RAM, and over 96gb of memory (over 50gb always free). However, on both devices, the program hogs so much resources it often freezes and stalls when on Prime Stations - the main use I have for it. No matter how many background resources I free up, how high a priority I give this app to run on my systems, it has these problems on Prime Stations. Oh, and my internet is a 17mb/s system, so no lack of resources there either: I'd hate to try this on a 3 or 4g hookup. All too often, after a genre-station plays the first song/piece, the second buffers and *looks* like it's playing. But, the resources are so clogged that the *sound* is missing. Then when you try any of the controls to change songs or stations or genre, the app is non-responsive. And, shutting the app down won't free up your system, even force-closing it in the device's settings won't do it: you have to shut down and restart. Until Amazon programmers get this app in line with other music apps and reduces the resource grab, I wouldn't waste the effort using this. The *only* possible use for it is to preview singular songs/pieces (as long as they're free to Prime-members) to see if your interested enough in getting it somewhere you can add it to your collection in an app that runs better."
Amazon,I don't really listen to Amazon music thing wrong with it I have no idea I'm not good at making review,ross southerland,10-Oct-17,1,I wouldn't know what to tell you I don't look for Amazon for music for some weird reason and I can pull teeth reading books unless I have to
Amazon,Can't stream to multiple locations from Mac.,B. Olson,13-Jan-17,3,"Just downloaded the Amazon Music app to my Mac desktop to test out the service. It appears that it isn't possible to stream the music via Airplay like you can in iTunes. Without this ability, the App is pretty much worthless for those who stream music to a remote stereo via wifi.On edit: Apple might be most to blame for not allowing streaming to multiple locations. If one option/clicks the speaker icon in the bar at the top of the finder screen, you do have the choice to pick a streaming location. Unfortunately, you can only choose one location at a time, so if you want to listen to music from your computer as well as remotely, you're out of luck. Increasing my rating to three stars since this isn't Amazon's fault."
Amazon,I liked how you get a list of artists to chose ...,Amazon Customer,25-Dec-15,4,"I liked how you get a list of artists to chose from not just a search bar! Has many repeated songs and not by original artist songs. Not as many oldies as I was looking for, no Madonna immaculate collection, or good Berlin, does have some others don't have, for the $ I went with Spotify to get Paul Wilbur, English & Spanish versions.."
Amazon,Wish there was an alternative!,revmrblack,20-Apr-17,1,Crashes on many albums.  Also assumes I want to be online so it is difficult to play music I have on my hard drive.  Very poorly executed software.  I much prefer Rhythmbox on Linux.
Amazon,"Been using it for one year, and it's not gotten any better - also, data hog",E. Orchard,26-Aug-15,3,"As a Prime member, I was so excited when this app came out - ""free"" music! However, this is one of the worst interfaces I've seen, and I'm pretty tech savvy. I've seen several updates made to the app, and each time, it doesn't get any better. I can't tell the difference between my music, music I've downloaded (but not paid for) and I have no idea if I'm streaming music or playing it off my phone. There's a cloud library and an offline library, but they seem to contain the same thing.I never really cared too much about this (whether I was streaming or playing my music ""offline"") until I started using the app again recently and noticed I was using a lot of data on my phone. I started clearing my statistics on my phone to see how much the Amazon Music app was using. On my trip to work, which is about 10 mins, if I listen to Amazon music, it uses about 25 - 45MB. By contrast, I fired up Pandora and for the same 10 mins, it used 2.5MB. That's a HUGE difference!Though the free music is great, and it seems to contain a lot of music I like, it's a data HOG if you're streaming and the interface is poor."
Amazon,"AMAZON PLEASE FIT IT, THIS COULD BE THE NEXT GREATEST PLAYER IF YOU DID!!",Kira S.,25-May-16,2,"Unable to repeat music on my Android devices. That being said, and with the low star count, this player is still my primary source of music since I don't have to illegally download anything and since by weird coincidence all my artists seem to offer their music for free on Prime. I emailed the developer about this issue just a moment ago, so I'll wait to see how that goes but if they manage to update the  player I'll modify this review. Rarely have I had it stop playing a song in the middle of playing (both wifi and data) so that's a plus.Pros: Kills the need to illegally download most music, gives recommendations on new artistsCons: Cannot repeat, app force-shutdowns constantly. For Windows 10, the interface keeps changing back to Albums instead of Artists (like, who the heck searches for music by ALBUM instead of ARTISTS??)"

Amazon,Nice app to have,Dan D.,6-May-17,4,"good app to have on the tablet or phone if described yourself as a music lover. While sometimes it buffers for a short period of time, it is a good app."
Amazon,another leaving customer.,Christine,8-Jan-17,1,"I used to love Amazon Music. Im so sad that it no longer works. It just locks up, and it takes forever to load the icons (Which aren't necessary). I just want to play my music quickly, not wait 10 minutes for all the icons to load and then have it crash, never getting to even listen to my music.  I only purchased music from Amazon bc it went directly to my player; guess I will stop all purchasing of music from Amazon now and just switch to ITunes. Sad."
Amazon,WHY does this idiot app insist on putting downloaded music in DEVICE STORAGE?!,ScreechingSnake,30-Jan-15,3,"I have been using Amazon Prime Music on my PC since the service was announced. Having purchased a samsung Tab Pro 10.1 I was hppy to find my old friend Amazon Music available for Android. Iinstalled it, and once i figured how to download my favorite albums Iwas in hog heaven, until my tablet suddenly stopped being able to download anything.The idiot app was stashing all downloaded music in device storage, so my puny 16Gb of device storage ws all gone while my 64Gb of SD memory was sitting gloriously empty except for some pictures from the camera and some tunes I'd burned via USB from my PC, which went to sd memory as God intended. This behavior continued despite me moving the app to SD. Happily, bringing up the app's on-device list allowed me to easiy delet about 3Gb of music I didn't really need, so I was able to download a bit more stuff I really DID want with some room left over for apps and whatnot.Since the app cleverly hides the downloads from the outside world, I am unable to transfer the music to a less horrendously unreasonable location. GRRR! Since I spent a very long career as a software developer for a top flight skunk works, poory designed software makes me VERY angry, VERY angry INDEED! If it wasn't for this rabidly user hostile feechur, I'd have cheerfully given this this a 5 rating! I'll be transferring 20 gig or so of tunes from my PC to the SD chip - thank heaven Amazon Music is able to see and use such files.One other small quibble: unlike the PC version, there's no volume control in the app - you have to tweak the system volume. A small thing, but inconvenient."
Amazon,Current location for downloads is not settable by the user: Amazon music can't be put on the external sd card.,P.M.,28-Jun-14,2,"I am disappointed because the app won't allow me to save music on external memory (micro sd card) - which limits/kills the Amazon Prime perk of downloading for offline listening!While you can transfer/put your own music from your PC to the external memory card, anything that comes through the Amazon Music app will only be stored in the main memory. In my case, my 8GB phone (Moto G LTE) will run out of space quite quickly.Athough my android Android 4.4.3 KitKat shows the move app option, it does not work!I am seriously looking into a different ecosystem which has an app that allows me to store music on the external micro SD (32 GB). I find the app only useful when streaming (wifi), although I have to say that, for this particular purpose, there are better (pay) options out there."
Amazon,Takes over your phone!,Tom Ewald,24-Sep-15,1,"Nice to be able to download my free Amazon Prime Music, but at what a cost! OK, my headline is a little over the top, but is there ANY way to keep this idiotic app from looking at all the music on my phone that has nothing to do with Amazon? I have a LOT of other files, some music, some brain entrainment stuff, and this stupid app insists on listing it all, so it basically gets in the way of finding the Amazon stuff when I want to. I want the Amazon app to handle Amazon stuff, and leave my stuff alone."
Amazon,Good but not great.,aimeeregina,5-Mar-17,3,As a prime member the music selection is extensive but the app ends up crashing quite a bit or will take forever to upload. The app's updates have helped rectify the problems but the problems still exist.
Amazon,"Great App, but needs further growth",Blackcat,13-Aug-15,3,"I wish that storage for personal music wasn't restricted to 250 songs for free and up to 250k for $25/year. If there was a way to upload more legally purchased music to the cloud for playback, I would be sold. This aspect of personal music storage is a huge selling point for Amazon Prime Music versus online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have. What I'd love to see is a way to sync or play music from the cloud that I've purchased elsewhere either via cd or digitally.

I hate surfing through sixteen pages of music suggestions to find what I am looking for at the best possible price.2nd, some of the sample music is of poor quality, sounds like too much treble or like it is in a barrel.  Maybe this is just the websites player but I find that the more expensive the song the better it sounds on the sample player.  It's funny that the same song on five different albums can sound so different.3rd, now that I've spent an hour surfing for 10 songs I have the nightmare of checking out.  Amazon wants to make it so easy to check out (or get my money) that when I click buy they automatically charge the last debit card I used without my permission or without letting me review the card and charges first.  Now I've got a $50.00 service charge from my bank because I didn't have the cash on that card, it wasn't the card I wanted to use.  You can't change the way Amazon stores you payment information.  The only alternative is to go into your account after each transaction and delete your payment method, more time consuming.  And if you want to call Amazon to complain, good luck.  They don't have a phone number on the web site and it is unpublished.  To make it more confusing, when I switch to my account to change my payment method it takes my to Amazon Prime and then I cannot get back to Amazon Music.  The icon for my cart (amazon music cart) is gone.  So I click on the my cart icon and it says my cart is empty.  I finally figured out that I have to scroll through several tabs to get back to Amazon Music.4th Now that I've made my purchase and want to simply download my new music, it's not so simple.  I have to download their app (that I don't want) to get my music.  Once downloaded the app requires a short coarse on how to use it.  If you want to download your music to Windows Media Player then not so hard.  But if you want to copy it to your device then it's a multi step process.  The download app doesn't ask where I want my music saved nor does it tell me where it saved it.  After searching my hard drive I finally found my newly downloaded music, but in my download file.Why can't it be simple, enter what I want, click buy, enter my payment method and download, that simple."
Amazon,Pure Garbage!,Electrorenfro,20-Dec-15,1,"Not only is the user interface on this a logistical nightmare, the core of this app is a resource hog. I'm running am 8-core 3ghz mac with 128gb ram and the app just freezes, then quits on startup, every time. Go ahead, open your activity monitor. Wow is right. How does an app this small use 158.4% of a 4K video rendering monster. How, just, uh...It just blows my mind that Amazon has produced such an epic P.O.S. Seriously, I can't imagine a company that sells music, failing in such epic proportion at producing a decent piece of software to manage and play music. How awful is the Amazon Fire? The Kindle? Echo? I don't know, why would I ever buy hardware from a company that can't write software to manage their own content. You shouldn't either. We, the consumers need to start making our collective voices heard by not buying into the failed ideas and policies of corporations based solely on greed and if complacency is to be considered, perhaps even sloth."
Amazon,What a terrific addition to Amazon Prime!,codejester,27-Jan-16,4,"Amazon prime music released and as a paid and happy Pandora user, I was skeptical. Since I was already a Prime user as well, I gave Amazon a shot for a month. By the end of my personal test looking for music quality, variety and features like station streaming, I closed my Pandora account and haven't missed it much. While Pandora does a better job matching similar music in streaming stations, Amazon is on par in every other area I care about."
Amazon,Garbage. Will never use again!,Richard Anthony,16-Nov-15,1,"This has got to be the absolute worst way to purchase and download music. If the goal was to make folks go thru silly unnecessary steps to download and find music, then mission accomplished. The folks who designed this nightmare need to be fired, asap! Do not recommend to anyone, unless they are your enemy."
Amazon,DAVE STAMEY IS JUST GOOD STUFF!,Dr. Bob,26-Jun-15,5,"I got ""hooked"" on Dave Stamey's music, his poetry and his guitar. All fit together with his ""cowboy voice."" My wife and I saw him perform at a Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Golden, Colorado last year. We bought three of his CD's: (1) Come Ride With Me; (2) Twelve Mile Road; and (3) If Ihad a Horse. We both liked them so much that we ordered all his albums--but at the used prices; when you add in $3.99 shipping, the net cost of each album was less than the new one with Prime/free shipping."
Amazon,Incomplete - needs explicit content controls!,LeftCoast20,10-Jun-17,2,"Really wish you could block explicit content...it's holding us back from buying a family membership. Please Amazon, allow users to block explicit lyrics like other music services so that us parents can enjoy Amazon Music as a family worry free - especially since I invested in having echo products throughout the house."
Amazon,"Frustrated, and poor support",Amazon Customer,18-Jan-16,1,"I am so frustrated with this app on iPhone.  I purchased my first album here today, instead of using iTunes, like I normally do, and I've spent 45 minutes of frustration trying to download my songs.  I went to the cloud library and saw my album after purchase, selected ""Download"" (which has now changed to ""Downloaded,"" but when I go to my ""Offline Library"" they aren't there.  In fact, there is an automatic playlist for ""Recently Downloaded Songs"" and it's empty.  How do I view my queue?  I've spent quite a few time between Google and Amazon search trying to figure this out, and I'm SUPER ANNOYED!  I don't think I will ever buy an album on Amazon again.I was finally able to download the album through my computer, and use iTunes to transfer to my phone, but I'm so annoyed with this app on iPhone.  There needs to be a way to view your download queue, and see what, if any the problem is."
Amazon,"Bad Move Amazon, changing from fee for prime members to a yearly fee",Shawn F.,19-Dec-16,1,"Loved this app, especially since it came with Prime subscription,  But now that it cost $79/year to get the songs that were free (the free version does not have many songs and very few of the favorites i had).  I will now be removing this app and going to something else."
Amazon,Goodbye Pandora!!,Scott in Texas,30-Oct-17,5,"Amazon music is like having a personal, infinite library of just sbout every song in existense with genre shuffle, direct search and NO commercials, no limits on how often you can switch tracks and no constant badgering to upgrade or buy something. Goodbye Pandora!!"
Amazon,Was better as Amazon mp3...but could be a 5 star,Neal V Summers,26-Jul-14,3,"It was a lot better when it was Amazon MP3,The side scroll is a nice touch. Wish it coulld go landscapeon tablets,when playing music show the yitles on the bottomwith large print option for someone like me who is visuallyimpaired in settings who can't see small print that would be aplus.the prime is pretty cool,but once you decline it that's it quit asking!...lollso when transfering my wmas,mp3's etc..it used to add yhem automatically,Now it acts remedial dosen't add without either signing outor clearing the cache itself plus clearing the data.All in all pretty decent,but needs to be for tablets and phones.We need the freedom back of buying amazon mp3s and putting themon our external microsd storage instead of cloud music!If these changes can be made I will give 5 stars"

Amazon,Amazon Prime Music streaming service has improved,bc,14-Apr-15,4,"Update: Apr 28, 2015:  My review went from 2 stars to 4 because with the latest feature additions.  They added stations.  Pick a genre and play music.  No stupid play list.  The android app still lacks artist search in the station area.I have tried to like Amazon Prime Music streaming service.  This is my second time since its original release.  But it just lacks common sense features that other streaming services provide.Pro: One very nice feature that stands out above the others is AmazonÛªs x-ray.  Lyrics display during a song.Con: Amazon Prime is hard to use.  Everything is centered on either an Artist or a Play-List.  Where others like Pandora, Spotify, and etc have something called a Station.  A station is similar genre music.Search for an Artist in Amazon, you get a list of Singles and Albums for that Artist.  Now what?  Play one song and search again?  I personally never want to listen to more than one song of a given Artist.  I want Random.You can make your own Play Lists.  But that is just too completed to listen to random music of a genre.  You can select a preexisting Play List.  There are some nice preexisting lists.  But after x songs are done, and then you have to select another list.Pandora is still the simplest to use."
Amazon,Dodgy,Phil (San Diego),27-Dec-14,3,"If you use both PC and Android devices to stream music from your Amazon cloud, this Android app's limitation of 500 songs per playlist risks truncating large playlists that you have created in the more usable web interface. Twice in the past month or so my playlists have been truncated to this app's limit of 500 songs. I believe this may happen if you have the same playlist open - not even playing, just open - in the Android interface and in a PC interface. It's happened when I've had the web interface up, and it's happened when I had the Amazon Music desktop app up.The most recent update to this app seems to be crashing a lot, with different error codes each time. Exception 94, Exception 182. The newest version no longer displays song length, so if you have the single version, the album version, and the extended version, there's no telling how much time remains til the next track; the best you can do is re-edit the mp3 ""title"" tags on every song for which you have multiple versions.All Amazon Music interfaces - web, desktop, mobile - are exceptionally weak at library management. Updates and improvements are driven by populist demand, ensuring that app development will proceed as an ever-reducing concentric circle for a single constituency - those for whom the greatest feature add is ""pictures of stuff"". Although Amazon sells its Premium Cloud service with the promise that you can upload as many as 250,000 songs in addition to your Amazon mp3 purchases, the functionality reveals that Amazon's target audience resembles the kid on the bicycle on the web login page; a small collection of mp3s organized into playlists about as long as an album, or maybe even a box set.This is the Android app I use the most, more than the rest of the smartphone put together; I didn't really want a phone, I wanted an mp3 player. The unreliability of the Amazon Music app is disappointing. Life was better when Amazon didn't use this app to push its subscription streaming service. Sooner or later a developer will create a library management app that will be able to stream playlists from your Amazon cloud. I look forward to such alternatives."
Amazon,DISAPPOINTING,John C. Haslett,16-May-17,1,More problems than I need.
Amazon,Limited Usability,Ann Decker,29-Jul-15,1,"Music files can only be downloaded to a mobile device, not to a desktop computer.And it's impossible to locate the files on the mobile device,so you can't move them to play them offline on a computer.I don't walk around with headphones glued to my ears, so having music on a mobile device is not my thing. And I don't want to have to go online whenever I want to listen to music from my computer.Amazon Prime Music is what it is, and nothing more. But it's not enough for me."
Amazon,This has improved tremendously!,The Dude,23-Jun-14,4,"So I have been buying music through this for awhile because, let's face it Amazon often has better prices than Apple. However I have never really liked how this app works.Now we have the addition of Prime Music! Huzzah, the selection of songs is actually pretty nice, sadly you have to listen to it through this player. Which would be ok, but it is not like you can have it build dynamic playlists for you based on your musical preferences, also no function for rating music( not sure why Amazon does not easily provide this in their apps as this would seem obvious). I have been toying with Spotify considering if I want to spend my money on it or not, or maybe Google's streaming service. Amazon's players lack of features and usability does not do well to recommend their prime service. Luckily for them 2 day shipping is always what it is.Also the inability for 2 people to listen to Prime music at the same time is lame.*Update*The service is steadily improving, Would like to see the stations get added to the app as this would resolve an issue with it I have had for awhile. I would also like to see an Android Wear app for this to control playback."
Amazon,What was once good is no more.,Matt,9-Dec-13,1,"Until the last update, this was my primary listening app. Most of the music I listen to is stored on my SD card (I have around 30 GB of music locally) and the app would play it just fine. Now since the update, it apparently won't read from the SD card (my other players still do, so I know they're there) and there is no way to direct it to look in specific locations.I will not upload my entire collection to stream as that would be a waste of data and the limitations on Amazon MP3 make that a non-option anyway. I like purchasing music on the app as the prices are usually better than the alternatives, but until they fix the app back to the way it was, I'll be downloading them to my computer, then transferring to my phone to use with a different app.Oh, the new interface blows as well."
Amazon,"Android app that isn't compatible with an Android phone...pointless, not worth wasting the time to download!",SharonHultman,12-Aug-17,1,"This is the sorriest excuse for a music app that I have ever seen!  According to Amazon, the Android version of the app is compatible with my Fire tablet, but strangely enough, not with my Android phone.  I am about to embark on a cruise trip, and wanted to have the music I purchased from Amazon to be available to put on my phone.  It's nice to have a little mood music in your stateroom.But even though I paid for the mp3s I want to download, I'm being told that I can't because my LG Android phone is apparently not compatible with the Android version of the app.In the words of our current Pres, ""Very, very disappointing!"""
Amazon,If they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear,Catherine Murphy,19-Jul-14,3,"It's okay but only as a secondary music solution for you. First of all, I was super disappointed that ""free music"" really meant ""some free music"". The promotions and even the website make it seem like Prime members have access to full library for free. But then you start searching for songs and see all these price tags. It's super confusing until you realize you only have access to an oddball conglomeration of tunes. Their categories are horrible. I mean, when I see Pop as a category I think it's going to be today's pop music - not Pop songs from decades past. There's no ""today's hits"" section, top 40, or anything like that. And don't get me started on the weird music collections they've assembled. Who are these people who put together playlists? Absolute rubbish. All that aside, if you want to hear some old Journey or AC/DC album in its entirety, you can do that, so there is some value to the service, although if they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. You could totally survive without this mediocre service."
Amazon,Another great benifit of Amazon Prime membership.,Tommie Blanchard,29-Apr-17,5,"Works great for me, coupled with my wireless headphones I can listen to most any song anytime I want.just another great part of Amazon Prime!"
Amazon,BUGGY,jaxnavynuke,1-Aug-12,1,"I used this enough to know its poorly written, which I COULD live with until, the 250 song limit. I do not know how folks that live on their Cell phones do it.Thankfully I have tons of storage at home. I will still use Amazon S3, but this cloud drive is total bs. its really sad they can make you agree to an agreement they can change at anytime, but you cannot. So bye bye so called free player. I do understand they got hammered by the Music co lawyers, but all my mp3 are legal. Its not like amazon is storing a new copy, its called de duplication. They got the hard drive space and its costs them next to nothing. Now the Music co will get a cut, and amazon will too.later amazon, thanks for the so called 6 months of free storage......."
Amazon,The worst app ever!,James M. Whaley,10-Feb-15,1,"Terrible app. The old Amazon app was much better. Difficult to check device before purchasing music to determine if I already own the song. Many songs purchased through Amazon do not indicate that it is already In Library resulting in purchasing the song twice.  Lately, songs purchased through the app appear in the app as on the device but not when using the Android Music Player.  I can only play newly purchased songs on the Amazon player which has a habit of locking up the phone when used with my Strava running app.  To unlock the phone I have to pull the battery.  All in all a terrible app."
Amazon,Not Impressed!  Needs VAST improvements!,Okie girl,9-Sep-14,2,"First - I have a Galaxy 3 and use the android app.  The previous Amazon MP3 music app wasn't the best.  I had to turn it off by putting the screen on the song and clearing the queue, but once I figured that out, it was an okay app.  The new app that includes Prime is much worse.  It will not shut off at all!  I have to go to settings and sign out for it to stop running; therefore, I have to log in every time I want to use this app.  Also the free music is full of tribute bands.  Really Amazon?  I'm starting to think that the only thing good about Prime is the two day shipping.  My kindle only allows borrowing once a month, and it doesn't take that long to read a book.  I am NOT impressed Amazon!"
Amazon,Amazon mp3 Was Better,B. M. Ward,14-Jun-14,3,"I've had my galaxy 3 tab for about 5 months now, and had just gotten used to Amazon mp3, when they came up with this new app.  I'm sure the app has some nice features, which I haven't explored yet, but there is one thing fundamentally wrong with this new app, wich for me, makes it multiple times less functional than the old app.  That is it''s portrait only orientation.  Why is it so?  Because when trying to create playlists, I can't read an entire id tag because it's too long.  If you listen to classical music with the opus numbers at the end of the tag, you know what I mean.  Fix this, and all the other glitches, Amazon, and you get a 5."
Amazon,Great app,Harold Hamblet,10-Nov-17,5,Works great for transferring and playing your Amazon music to your android phone. Bonus: It's EASY to use.
Amazon,The older orange player was excellent. The new blue one is absolutely horrible,Douglas Reitz,17-Feb-17,1,The older orange player was excellent.  The new blue one is absolutely horrible.  It hangs after playing 1 or 2 songs.  Offline library cannot by used offline..like when on a flight (my primary use of this app) . It can play one song then hang...so you close it and try another... Some songs won't play at all.  Really wish I could get the old orange version back.  I really regret upgrading.  This is a review of Android version
Amazon,Too hard to weed through the stations,Moonbeam,30-Jun-16,4,"First, I'll say that I really like the sheer volume of stations to choose from. No matter what mood I'm in, I'm pretty sure there's something to suit. That said, I can't easily find what I want! I would love it if I could first select a genre, then choose from the appropriate stations under that heading. It's just a real pain to scroll endlessly, trying to see what's what. And by the time you think, ""oh, I'll go back to that one channel I saw"", you've lost it."
Amazon,"The selection of music isn't bad, but all versions of the app are horrible",James,7-Aug-16,1,"The selection of music isn't bad, but all versions of the app are horrible. Editing playlists is a nightmare. There must be some way to reorder songs in a playlist that doesn't take hours, but I can't figure it out. It took me a day to figure out how to not use random order. There's no way to rate individual songs,ÛÜ and a song that you have one day can be removed from Amazon Prime the next day.If you are fine with someone else giving you playlists, and don't really want to create your own library and curate your own collection, this is okay. But when I hear a song I don't like, I want to get rid of it. When I hear a song I like, I want to mark it in some way to listen to it again. Amazon Prime Music is not for people like me."
Amazon,The app not great but the media purchasing service is excellent,Mightymouse,2-Oct-14,2,"Don't like the app on my Galaxy S5  phone as it isn't as user friendly as using the ipod and itunes but its where I buy all of my music these days so it will have to do. Even using the app for PC it isn't  as intuitive as itunes. Have to get into too may screens to select stuff. Tunes get stuck in the play back too if its playing from the cloud so I just download to device to bypass the cloud. The service of Amazon Music with Prime is excellent. Quick downloads, great selection. Prime music doesn't always work. Give it a rest and try back another time and it may work."

Amazon,Not good enough for me since they could not tell me ...,REB352,25-Apr-15,1,"My complaint with this app is that once you launch the app there is no clear way to stop/exit/quit. I contacted their tech support about this issue and they claim that if you pause the app for long enough period of time it will eventually close. Not good enough for me since they could not tell me how much data it continues to suck up during that ""eventually"" time period. The best way to insure that it stops is go to the app manager and force stop. I just decided that was too much trouble and uninstalled."
Amazon,Used to be great!  Now it crashes NON-STOP when not in use.,D. Arreola,2-Mar-16,1,"I used to love this app.  It was one of the major reasons I joined Prime.  But recently it crashes almost non-stop.  I was recently watching a video on youtube and 45 seconds in and the Amazon music app crashed 4 times!  It continually crashes when I'm on other apps as well.  Its so frustrating, I've finally just uninstalled it. This almost frustrates me to the point of canceling my Prime membership.  Please fix it!  I own an LG G3."
Amazon,first thing I hate more than Google,Jim,30-Sep-15,1,Congratulations.

Amazon,needs unnecessary permissions,Amazon Customer,16-Nov-15,1,"This app requires access to my private phone logs, phone call history, photos, accounts, starts on startup so that it always runs in the background. Is it really necessary for a mp3 store interface ? I chose not to install this app because of this.  It's basically just spyware at this point."
Amazon,Wonderful edition to Prime!!!  Wonderful music app!!!  Such an unexpected value!,Classic Music and Book Lover,4-Aug-14,5,"Love this music app!  I am a lover of many different genres of music.  From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc.  I previously used Pandora and I å¢å_ Radio.  Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better!  I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping.  It was well worth it.  As a whim, I decided to try the music app.  I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love!  I was quickly creating my own playlist.  I have created quite a library with so many different types of music.  I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone.  I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy.  I find all of the process easy.  The only warning is some songs that are free are ""rerecorded"" so watch for that and play samples before purchasing.  Those songs are the minority, but can happen.  If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library.  It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews.  I haven't shared their experiences at all.  Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc.  I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app!  I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim.  Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music.  I simply search for artist and songs.  Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love.  I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also.  I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free.  So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices.  This is a great gift in itself.  I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."
Amazon,"Nice Music Selection, Poor & Frustrating User Interface",TheReubenator,18-Aug-17,2,"Great music selection available, but the user interface sucks. To delete an album from your library you have to delete EACH SONG 1 by 1! That's really bad by design IMHO. Why force users to waste time like that? Frustrating."
Amazon,Updates to the app deletes content for all device playlists - forces streaming.,David Kerr-wilson,1-Jul-14,1,I have and use this app daily.  But the last two updates wiped out my device playlists.  The playlist screen even has a little button to toggle between device and cloud.  worked until the updates.... rebuilt the playlist on the device.... today's update?  wiped out the playlist that was local.  I don't want to have to hook up to every strange wi-fi signal I can get to stream my music - I download and play.  Wiping out playlists is just wrong.
Amazon,Great so far,Jamie M.,27-Sep-17,5,"Great so far, just need to make sure the songs are the actual artist songs not done by someone else"
Amazon,Eats data like it tastes good.,Foster,21-Jul-14,1,"I've been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years.  I've generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I'm not super tech savvy.  My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it's a pain in the rear (apparently my files couldn't be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album wouldn't).  My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I'd have to re-learn where everything was again.  But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to 4.0.4.Which has sucked.  I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed.  I've found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason.  I'm not a big data consumer.  My average data use over the past year or so doesn't usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month.  I'm on Wi-Fi more often than not (at home and at work, so I'm usually only streaming 3g/4g in the car).  Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I'm close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over 700 mb of data.In 4 days.When I'm not using the app, I close it.  It restarts itself.  I close it again.  It restarts again.  And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off.  Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I've never had before, and I'm not just disappointed with the app.  I'm pretty well disgusted with it.  If I'm in my car, I can't fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it's still buffering.  It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I've now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi.  Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I've used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I won't likely abandon it right off the bat.  I'll take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library (again), and move on.  In the meantime, I'm peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app won't just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I've previously enjoyed and recommended to others.  That won't be happening again."
Amazon,fix the basics!!,SMxoxSF,27-Sep-16,3,"look, Amazon--I am SO happy to have acces to my music via my mobile devices. the concept is excellent. the execution, however, needs some major improvement. please FIX the navigation and selection of music. I don't know if it's your Apple interface, but when I click on an album to play it, the app selects random songs from within the album. when I want to play all of an artists' music, same problem. the LAST thing I want to have to do EVERY TIME I go to play my music is fight with the app to get it to select the music I want--you know: the one I put my mouse over and clicked on. this is so basic, I cannot beleive it continues to be a problem. fix it, please, and I'll change to the max rating."
Amazon,"Okay app, but needs some simple improvements",Erik,28-Jul-14,3,"Their latest update makes the app harder to use.  I like the app overall - it easily lets me play music from my device or my cloud.  I really like the Prime Music, and you can even download Prime songs.  It's fairly easy to navigate and use, but I do have some complaints:-The app doesn't rotate with your phone.  When I listen to music at work, I usually have my phone charging, which means the phone is on its side (horizontal) - makes it hard to easily see and scroll through the app when it doesn't rotate with the orientation of the phone.-After the update to this app, it's crashed several times on my Galaxy S5 in the middle of a song...don't know why - just shuts itself down.-On the other hand, the app won't quit when I try to shut it down.  First off, there's no ""sign out"" or ""exit program"" in the main menu.  The only way I can easily find to quit the program is by dropping down my phone's menu of running applications (the quick menu), and there's a little x to close the Amazon Music app.  Only about 10% of the time does this x button work.  Sometimes it'll look like the app closes, but when I turn my phone off, then back on, the app is back on my home screen.  The only true way of completely closing this app and stopping it from running on my phone is by going to my phone's application manager and terminating the process for this app - that's a completely unacceptable means of closing an app, IMHO.-There's no option in Settings that prevents the screen from going to sleep.  Again, when listening to music at work, I like to keep my phone on and see what's playing easily skip through songs and choose what I want to listen to.  Unless I go to my phone settings and turn off the screen sleep option, the phone goes to sleep.  So every time I want to change songs, I have to wake the phone up, unlock it and change songs.-The only way you can see the time position of your song and the length of the song is by tapping the screen.  The time position and length of each song should be shown all the time (or at least give us the option to show it constantly)"
Amazon,More work than it is worth.,R.W.S.,1-May-17,1,"This used to be an intuitive and effective app.  At the last upgrade it forgot all of my non-amazon music, I had to redownload thousands of my amazon songs, and I have lost all of my play lists.More work than it is worth and I'm looking for a replacement."
Amazon,"Takes up too much of your phones storage, I ...",Vince F.,27-Jan-16,3,"Takes up too much of your phones storage, I understand of you don't own the music that it can't be installed on the SD card but the bulk of the files could, and the part of the file that allows playback could stay on the device storage, freeing up your device storage for other things."
Amazon,"So far, it seems to have a limited selection ...",Amazon Customer,15-Oct-14,3,"So far, it seems to have a limited selection of ""Free"" music. If it was just a music service, I wouldn't expect much, but if seems to be promoted as part of ""Prime"", which I pay for. I expected a bigger selection of free music.... I guess it is what it is....."
Amazon,I love it. It is well worth upgrading to Unlimited,Chris,19-Sep-17,5,"I love it. It is well worth upgrading to Unlimited, as well. Between having the app on my phone and my playlist at the ready...heaven to my ears!"
Amazon,Rip off,Lanky,19-Oct-16,1,Kinda sucks.. paying 79.99 a year and can't even listen to almost half the band's I listen to without having to buy the albums.
Amazon,Removed half the music I listen to,Kindle Customer,8-Aug-17,1,"Amazon unlimited subscription previously provided a good array of music and though it didn't have everything,  to me,  it was worth the subscription. I'm not sure what happened but almost half the songs in my playlist now are not included. I don't see the point to pay a fee to get almost nothing. I have unsubscribed."
Amazon,Music Removals,Tammy W.,20-Nov-16,4,"I loved it and used it a lot. It has been awhile but when I went back to it yesterday, I found that many of my favorites were no longer available on it. One of the big reasons I have Prime is for the music so I was quite disappointed. I still love the app but really wish they wouldn't have removed so many of the albums I loved the most."
Amazon,"Frustrating, lackluster - I thought Amazon would be a leader for the cloud music experience.",chicvibe,4-Apr-16,1,"This app is incredibly frustrating, and the effectiveness varies by device.  I have it on two rokus, two pc's, my iphone, my ipad, and amazon fire.  1.  I am a super-user, in that I have over 80k songs in my cloud subscription (which says storage is for ""up to 200,000"" - yeah, I know, ""up to"", but it keeps accepting my songs).  I kept getting a message that my (PC version) library couldn't be loaded because it had over 40k songs.  2.  When I try to get in to my library, I get the black computer screen of death that says ""ah fiddlesticks, if you continue to see this message, contact amazon"".  I see that message so often, that I just don't even bother.  My cache is clear, my computer is up-to-date.  Tiresome.  3. Because of problem #1, I thought I would open a SECOND cloud to split my library.  Wellllllll... Now it tells me that my computer can only be associated with ONE cloud account.  This is just my experience with the PC version.  It works well with Roku, except that I do not get prime.  It works okay with the Fire, but the interface with either is somewhat clunky for a large library.  I am phasing out not only using this app, but purchasing digital music from Amazon."
Amazon,Too cumbersome of an App.,Veronica Gill,19-Apr-17,3,"Takes up too much space in phone storage and uses up too much RaAM, cannot be shut down nor turned off neither. Kept crashing my phone even when it wasn't in use. Only thing good is that some music comes free with the App."
Amazon,Overall good,sf,6-Aug-15,4,"It's nice to have stations with no ads and unlimited skips. Sometimes it has trouble loading, and sometimes what's on the stations doesn't correspond well to the name. For example, Dire Straits radio plays very little Dire Straits. Overall, though, it's great. I love having offline access to the music from CDs that I bought in the past. That was a pleasant surprise."
Amazon,"Good, but not great",Dan Fethkenher,30-Mar-16,4,"I don't like that if you close the app and come back to it later, it always defaults back to the original screen. I want it to default to what I was playing last, or the search screen. Also, they're a TON of music I want to listen to that's not on here :/  4 stars."
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music app,Karen Lee,3-Nov-14,1,"Just bought a brand new LG G3 and first day updated my Prime Music library (done on my Kindles originally) with some new playlists.  The NEXT day, my phone was unable to open the pre-installed app without getting the following dialog box:  Amazon Music app has crashed.  I tried to uninstall (not able to without jeopardizing other apps.  I even tried going into the Amazon App store to download again, with same results.  Very disappointed if this app will not work on my new phone and also just realized it will not work on my 2nd generation Kindle Fire."
Amazon,Wish the unlimited music was included with Prime membership.,Julia Chachere,3-Jan-17,4,"I am very happy with this app, tho I wish the music selection was bigger. Not very thrilled that you have to pay extra for the unlimited music even with a Prime membership."
Amazon,Is there a way.......,Roger,12-Jun-14,1,"to give no stars.....this is such a poor app. I am really disappointed that Amazon would put out such a pathetic app. It simply does not work,and to top it off, it opens itself to portrait view, and there is no choice for landscape view,what the hell."
Amazon,Terrible!!!!,Fred O.,1-Aug-16,1,"First of all, it is the most user friendly-less app I have encountered to date. I can not figure out how to navigate within the app and I don't want to since there are easier apps to manage such as Pandora. I had a subscription before I discovered Amazon Prime Music and thought that since I am paying for Amazon Prime, why bother with Pandora. Well, the answer is that it is worth the $5/mo. for Pandora since it is so much cheaper  since frustration is very expensive."
Amazon,Inability to share digital content with household drives me away,zi,11-Feb-16,1,"Inability to share prime access with household drove me into google's arms. I have no idea why Amazon doesn't let me share digital content with my wife the way they do with prime shopping.I would be Amazon all the way for movies, music, audio books, etc if this were true. But I'm not paying another $100 for my own prime account and having all my digital content segregated from my wife's account."
Amazon,Well-done welcome addition to Prime offerings!,Jerswing,5-Aug-14,5,"Welcome addition to Prime offerings.Gorgeous, well designed App on Windows computer; Android App is merely adequate/functional.Limited selection of my favorite artists, but the Playlists are diverse & generally well-programmed.Playlists have provided access to a few new Track/Artist discoveries ... and, equally important, Tracks of interest which can be added to Music library.Especially appreciate ability to download Tracks/Playlists to portable devices for offline listening (I have Wi-Fi only Android tablets)Only wish someone at Amazon could explain how to download/install Prime Music App to older (but qualified) Android tab."
Amazon,Absolutely horrible user interface and Widget is useless,L. Casey,1-Sep-17,1,"I keep hoping that Amazon will get serious about their music offering but at this point I will not be renewing. The only positive thing is the integration with Echo. In Android, the interface is not user friendly. It's way too many clicks to get to your playlists and the ui is not intuitive. The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated. Other music services have widgets for direct playing of radio stations, playlists, etc. Amazon please play catch up and take this service seriously. I love Amazon but the music service applications are worthless and incredibly frustrating."
Amazon,Countdown to cancelling Prime membership,Drew,7-Sep-14,1,"I hate writing reviews, especially negative, but IÛªm to the point where it doesn't make sense to keep maintaining my Prime membership.  I will never own an Amazon Android branded device and attempting to use my Prime membership with my Android devices is the ultimate act in frustration.Amazon, why canÛªt I sync playlist?.  It was bad enough with previous Android app (playlist would never sync and required downloading whenever change on cloud or vice versa) but NOW no option to sync playlistsÛ_REALLY!So, with no hope of ever having android player for my video purchases and Prime membership, less than zero chance or Chromecast support and now the stripping of your measly convenience features for Android, I will not only be cancelling my membership but making it a point to convince family and friends to cancel theirs as wellÛ_Disgusting."
Amazon,"Clunky, unintuitive, frustrating",Marcus W. Hambright,25-Aug-15,1,"I tried using it when it first came out and it was so clunky and unintuitive that I've only been using it as a downloader since - and downloading music through this app is an awful experience every single time.  It almost always wants me to re-download and reinstall the app when I buy digital music, and when it reinstalls I often have to restart the app several times for it to recognize that I have purchased music and would please like to download the music.  A while ago, before amazon forced me into using this app to download their music, I used to buy so much more music, but now that the experience is so consistently frustrating, I wait until there are at least a few items for me to buy and I just stopped impulse buying music altogether.  I do like the color orange and think that white text works quite well on an orange background, so the app does have that one good thing going for it, but that's the only good thing I can think of."
Amazon,"Downloads, but won't install!",Curt J. Huffman,27-Mar-17,1,Can't even use it anymore. It says there's an update. Downloads the update. But hangs when you try to install it.
Amazon,"Watch out for autoplaying Prime stations from notification ""There is an Amazon Station we think you'll LOVE""",Polly L. Mccall,15-Apr-16,2,"I got a notification today - ""There is an Amazon Station we think you'll love!"" - I made the FATAL mistake of clicking on that notification. The station (NOT one I LOVE, for what it's worth - nice algorithm, guys) immediately started PLAYING! when I did not have my headphones in. NOPE! Do NOT ever autoplay ANYTHING without warning. That was embarrassing and disruptive. SHOW me the station, sure. Do NOT autoplay it.And wow, what ever made you think I would LOVE some Elton John right about now."
Amazon,"If it's free streaming, im lost at sea!",Christopher T.,15-Jul-16,1,"I couldn't find any original artists' versions of songs to stream for free. Only cover bands and their versions. Everything original was for sale, not for free stream."
Amazon,Tired of needing helo,jeff campbell,2-May-17,1,I give it one only getting that one because it worked so welll on my htc phone. But now im with boost mobile wich i understand is part of Sprint. Everytime i download the app for Android when I open it it says get amazon music  application for Android and ruound and round we go so I'll just forget it and go to pandora and i iheart radio. Heck the worst part is that im a prime member. I guess that doesn't mean  much anymore.
Amazon,"If you're a Prime member, you should be...",ju,13-May-16,5,"Many friends of mine who are Prime members aren't aware of how awesome Prime music is. They think it's like Pandora. It's like Padora ON STEROIDS! What's not to like? New artists being added all the time, just released albums being added all the time...I love prime music. Got even better with my Echo Dot. I can change genres, advance songs, go to playlists just by asking Alexa."
Amazon,Songs cut out,Elliott Nunez,19-Aug-17,3,After downloading songs they sometimes just stop playing. The whole song doesn't get downloaded. This has happened on several songs. I don't know if redownloading will help or not. Song selections could be better. Certain songs you have to pay extra for. You're already paying for music then you search for certain songs and you've gotta pay more.If it was new music I could understand but some songs are 20 years old. There are also a lot of good songs included too. That's why I rated 3 stars.I would've rated 5 stars if slot more songs were included at no extra charge. Another star deducted because of the download issue.
Amazon,Even adding playlists is an annoying chore because when I drag the song over the ...,Amazon Customer,2-Feb-17,2,"The interface on PC moves around. Even adding playlists is an annoying chore because when I drag the song over the playlist, the playlist *moves* out from underneath my mouse. I have to chase the playlist around the screen. The music selection is also.... not great."
Amazon,Finally Have My Music!,InHymn,2-Jan-15,5,"I had purchased several CD's from Amazon and thought to myself, Why carry and ipod and my Samsung Galaxy S5. I also wondered who I could call to help me transfer my music from my computer to my S5. Well when I purchased my last CD from Amazon it asked me about using Amazon Music, since I already had Amazon Prime. It did it all for me! Quickly and easily. It loaded all of my purchased CD's and music from Amazon into my new Amazon Music account. Then searched my computer, by request, for my iTunes music. Downloaded the app for Amazon Music to my phone. I checked my phone and it was all there. I can't believe the time I spent without my music on my phone and I could have had it all along! Amazon Prime was the best. But now with Amazon Music it is the greatest. Thank you Amazon!!!"
Amazon,Five Stars,Jimbob,16-Oct-17,5,Works much better on my android cell than the other two and no annoying commercials.
Amazon,Great value!,Eric,28-Mar-16,5,I tell everyone who will listen Amazon prime is the best value anywhere and Amazon music is part of that. You can download a TON of music to your device and listen to it without eating up your data. Perfect for when I'm at the gym with no WiFi and still want a great selection. Download all you can and listen later! Though you only can listen via amazon music player it's more than enough for me.
Amazon,Prime music has better radio and lists than Spotify,Penano,27-May-16,4,"IMO Prime music has better lists than Spotify and radio stations. I haven't experienced a repeated song in the radio stations, and new cool stations are suggested very often using the power of math. That's nice. The only issue is that I think that the library is not as huge as spotify which may be a problem if you look for specific songs very often."
Amazon,Not good,stevo,11-Aug-17,1,Not so great anymore. All the songs I have yet to download that were free for prime members now cost extra $.
Amazon,... the music I am looking for and I really like the off line library how ever music does take ...,holly tulgestke,4-Feb-16,3,I would give this 5 star's Because I can find all the music I am looking for and I really like the off line library how ever music does take alot of room on your device and I have not figured a way to put it on my SD card I have had to delete most of my library off my tablet because the music took up so much of my memory I was not able to even receive emails this is the reason for only three star's
Amazon,Five Stars,Patsy Glaser Gibson,7-Aug-17,5,I really like the selection. I'm just learning how to download and build my playlist. It's new to me.

Amazon,I love ALL kinds of music,Blue Tiger,16-Apr-15,5,"I love ALL kinds of music. I listen to music almost all day long. I like having a variety of music and change what I listen to based on what I am feeling at the moment or what I am doing, or need to do. Prime music allows me to an almost unlimited choice of music without having to pay for every single song or album. If you like to listen to different music genres and don't want to pay a bunch of money to have it then give Prime music a try."
Amazon,Needs a few simple but vital improvements,Stephen C. Innamarato,5-Sep-15,3,"I like the fact that I get to listen to music comercial free with my Prime Membership but the app needs a few vital improvements to get a 5 star rating.  1.) When clicking thumbs down, I wish it gave the option to  permanently exclude the artist from my station.  I don't like Nickleback and I keep pressing thumbs down only to have another Nickleback song play later on.  2.)  When creating Playlists, I wish it the had the capability of slecting songs from your cloud library AND your offline library for the same playlist.  3.) My favorite station  never stays up top and sometimes I have to search for the station I was listening to an hour ago.  Can we ""favorite"" stations and create a list?  4.) When listening to stations, I often will hear the same songs over and over within an hour or two but yet songs I hit the tumbs up for could take days until I hear them again.  That's just baffling!"
Amazon,quite buggy,Kathryn M.,29-Jun-14,2,"I was looking for a cloud/PC app that would allow me to ditch GooglePlay's music app on my PC and android phone (Samsung Note3 is what I presently have).  GooglePlay will allow you to upload your entire library from your PC, either iTunes, Windows Media player, etc.  Its pretty good, all the songs uploaded and you can create playlists and download those playlists to whatever device you're using.Amazon's does that, pretty much.  However, not all songs uploaded.  I tried rescanning and rescanning, and ever time it finds a few more songs to upload.  One album of mine in particular it absolutely refuses to upload.  Nothing is wrong with the format, or any of the locations I tried moving the songs to in order to try an upload... just tells me there isn't anything new in the folders to upload.  And no, they are not in the amazon library at all with me just missing them.  I checked the entire darn thing.Also, it uploaded quite a few songs multiple times.  Some songs won't play all the way through.  I can't seem to find a way to move an entire playlist to my device instead of just streaming the music using my data that I am limited on.  Since I don't have a wifi connection at work, this is pretty much useless for me.I like that I can use amazon prime music and get a lot of songs free, but since I can't get the app to work on my computer anyway (tried many times, and I'm tech savvy enough to be able to do that kind of thing) Amazon music isn't for me just yet.  Amazon, I hope you can fix these items, you're so close! :)"
Amazon,Fine if you only get your music from Amazon.,Christopher Kelly,14-Sep-16,3,"This app is solid, but it's working overtime to force my loyalty to Amazon. I get it; they're giving me a free app, that's their call. But the app struggles to find the MP3s that are already on my phone, and the music files I download from Amazon are in a proprietary format that other players can't recognize. Also, I have no control over the location of that music. Overall, it feels like this app is trying to control my experience in a way that other music players don't. If you really only get your music from Amazon Prime, then this is a great option. If you have a large collection of MP3s from multiple sources, then this app is more trouble than it's worth."
Amazon,"Sigh, Amazon why do you keep breaking my heart.",Mongo,15-Mar-17,2,"Used to be OK, nothing spectacular, but did what it was supposed to. However it no longer plays my offline music when not connected to the internet. This kind of defeats the purpose. Between this and all of the issues I have with prime shipping not actually delivering to my house since they insist on using surepost, I think its time to wean myself off Amazon. Kind of shame, it was a fantastic company, but they apparently are so busy doing new stuff that nobody is minding the day to day stuff."
Amazon,For Roku App,RKB60,23-Feb-17,1,"This is a review for the Amazon Music App for the Roku. I will preface this by saying I have a Fire TV, And a Fire stick, yet My Roku Stick's app will not let me stream Amazon Prime Music unless I own it. Why is the app features not the same across the board? Amazon has always claimed they didn't make a lot of money on the hardware but it was a way to entice people into joining Amazon Prime. I probably should not be venting on this site but maybe someone will listen. I still like Amazon Prime but there are some chinks in the armor. It will be interesting to see some of the decisions they make in the near future."
Amazon,Disappointing,Stephen,25-May-16,2,"Nice interface, can be a pain to navigate.  VERY LIMITED music selections, but don't worry, you can pay more to buy the music you want to listen to, or pay more to upload more of the songs you own.  Disappointed..."
Amazon,Galaxy S3,C. Zars,30-Nov-13,1,"With the latest update I've exchanged emails about missing music that the other apps have no problem finding.  In the cloud, the app still can't find some of my son's and had to go through the process of downloading them one at a time all over again.  See where I work they won't allow us access to the cloud so having songs on my S3 is important to have my music on my device.  Amazons update has lost 500 songs that I can't play.When I contacted Amazon they said clearcache. When that didn't work they said to refresh the cloud.  When that didn't work they said uninstall and reinstall.  Now they want me to call them and troubleshoot the app problem with them.Um excuse me but it id your app that has the problem, not me. I don't have time to sit on the phone and troubleshoot your bad app that keeps crashing, wants $24.99 a year to store my music when there are others out there that are free"
Amazon,I love Amazon Music,mia's mom,20-Dec-16,5,"I love Amazon Music.  I can stream it in the car or even when I'm travelling abroad.  There are so many different genres of music.  If you're not too keen on a particular song or songs, you can skip it (as many times as you want- unlike pandora non-premium) or  give it a thumbs down and it won't ever play again."
Amazon,me to stream prime songs on roku,Joselyn's Amazon,13-Nov-14,2,pleased with the app on the phone but very disappointed to find that all of the prime songs that are available are unable to be streamed on the Cloud Player for the Roku box I don't understand why this is possible because all the prime available movies are able to be streamed on the application for the Roku box why can't the prime eligible Songz be available for streaming on the cloud? I'm a very loyal Prime member and I wish that I could play my part I'm sold on the Amazon Cloud Player on my Roku

Amazon,... harassment to pay them $10-20 a month for their crappy music staff,devildog2006,15-Oct-15,5,"I am really enjoying this app and Apple recently completely ruined iTunes and I am fed up with my music getting deleted by them and now the inability in the Apple music app to play music from all of an artists album straight through and the constant harassment to pay them $10-20 a month for their crappy music staff. I have also noticed, the sound quality on Amazon music is way better and louder then when I listen in the Apple app. The bottom line: Ditching Apple iTunes like a bad habit, switching everything over to Amazon, and I may even add a cloud subscription so I can upload all of the stuff I have purchased from iTunes over the year to have it in one place. Please, please, keep it good and continue adding more music, and don't feel the need to copy Apple. Apple let its success got to its head and is on the decline, this is a breath of fresh air."

Amazon,It's gotten better....but could get even better,David S.,13-Jun-14,4,"I love having access to music via my Prime account.  This app still needs a little work.  At times it is sluggish.  I can't seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I'm listening to (not a huge loss there).  Navigation can be frustrating on a device.  The web interface is a bit better.  Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites.  That would help me a bit.  Also, how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order.  Kinda like a radio.  I'd love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music.** Updated on 11-14-2014The Android app has gotten very good (a new phone also helped).  I logged into the Windows desktop app last night and SURPRISE!!!!  Prime Stations!  How about adding that feature to the Android app?  I think that would be awesome!"
Amazon,Coming from spotify subscriber,Adrian,2-May-16,2,I miss spotify simple and easy gestures. From just being able to slide down the album cover from the top instead of having to press an arrow from the left top corner(furthest angle to reach when using dominant hand). Why is it that I have to add a song to the cloud in order to make a separate playlist. That very feature will cause accumulation of different music types. Also the lack of music choice feels significantly limited. Change the layout too it's just so boring and unorganized. Also add dates of albums to know what's new and maybe popularity LEVELS of music. There's potential but there a lot to work on. One thing I do like is the lyrics. But please look at your rivals and actually compete.-iPhone 6s user-
Amazon,Nice app,K. Dillingham,27-Jun-17,4,"Good if you have prime already.  It's a shame you have to pay more to get all the music choices.  If I didn't have prime, I would not pay for it.  Too many cheaper options out there, but it's a great perk with Prime.  It does need search improvement.  Sometimes I know certain genres exist but it doesn't know how to found the right style."
Amazon,Like it 4 stars worth,K Young,7-Jul-15,4,"I like Amazon music with prime much better than Pandora... it's FREE (with Prime).  Now... if it were as easy to use as Pandora and others, it would 5 star.  I love that it doesn't limit the skip forwards... you can still rate the songs... and there are SO many choices.  Just ANOTHER reason to get prime, every year."
Amazon,I never thought that I'd find something better. But with Amazon Prime there's so much free ...,D. Hildebrandt,5-Jan-15,5,"I was a loyal Pandora subscriber for 4 years. I never thought that I'd find something better. But with Amazon Prime there's so much free music that in a couple of months, I've got 1000+ songs. Sometimes I listen to music by album, sometimes by artist and sometimes I just play the songs in alphabetical order. I haven't had time to watch the free movies yet but I've checked through the titles and there's plenty that I'd like to watch. I'm also looking forward to watching Transparent, the original series with Jeffrey Tambor."
Amazon,I cant believe I can get such great quality music free this has been an eye opening ...,Jodi,12-Jan-16,4,"I cant believe I can get such great quality music free this has been an eye opening experience.The music is ordered by artist, genre etc. wish made me realize i really like alternative rock but had no idea that was even a genre of music. I wish it had a wider selection  especially of songs that have been extremely popular (it doesn't have Bastille Pompeii). On the bright side I've been able to listen to a wider selection of artists, I love listening to all these Broadway soundtracks too. Just a great overall app."
Amazon,Frustrating because promising,Amazon Customer,15-Sep-11,3,"This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone (an Atrix).  I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers (though the tagging and ""Unknown Artist"" issues still pose problems), and I love the browser interface.  However, the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality.  If it worked as it's supposed to it would be spectacular, offering the capability to buy a song from the store, then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly.  It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up (at least while you can stream it over wifi).  In practice, though, it just doesn't offer the experience it promises.  It force closes about 60% of the time I try to use it.  When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly (and usually then force closes).  Music playback often skips.  This last issue may be android's fault, as I've noticed it in other players, though never so badly as in the amazon one.  However, I don't experience the other problems in different music players.  Until Amazon fixes these issues, this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application.  It's an exciting idea, and the interface would be excellent if it just worked."
Amazon,New to Amazon music,linda,11-Sep-17,5,I just started using Amazon Music and am really enjoying it. I cannot wait to hear all of the music that I have missed over the years. Today I listened to Classic Country and it brought wonderful memories of my mom and my childhood. Truely the best so far.
Amazon,Love using Amazon music everywhere I go,Joseph Egan,19-May-17,5,"Love using Amazon music everywhere I go.  I have Amazon prime for music, movies and shows and am extremely happy with the selection.  I know other choices has more at this point but for the price of prime it is worth it."
Amazon,Best Option for Cross Country Music,Keith,8-Dec-15,5,"Had Pandora before but then realized that Amazon Music was included in my Prime membership at no additional charge.  Tried out Amazon Music for a week and immediately cancelled my Pandora subscription as I decided I had been wasting my money.  Since then I can honestly say that I am completely satisfied with Amazon Music.  I recently drove from California to Texas and back, streaming Amazon Music the whole way.  This was SO much better than either searching for a local station or paying for satellite radio.  Mark me as Very Satisfied."
Amazon,Incredible,Frank Williamson,29-May-17,5,Its incredible.  So current.  Great recommendations based on picks.  Hardly ever quits.  Good sound
Amazon,I love the Amazon music app that I get because of ...,A. Aguilar,19-Nov-15,5,"I love the Amazon music app that I get because of my Prime membership. I get to listen ALL of my favorite music. I have found almost every song I have ever loved and added it. You can listen by playlists that you make yourself or pre-made playlists. You can listen by album or artist too. I really love having this. There's always new music that I can listen to and the best part about it is, there isn't any COMMERCIALS or pop up ADVERTISEMENTS! Prime Music is the Best. I can skip a song, I can repeat the song just played, read the lyrics, and either use the thumbs up and they respond with ""we will play more like that,"" or thumbs down. ""we won't play that song again.!"" How perfect is that? I LOVE this app! I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
Amazon,SAD.  SAD.  SAD.,Jabee,7-Jun-17,1,"After reading ALL the reviews it looks like Amazon is becoming just like  AT&T , GREEDY; continually  increasing  prices.  I have no intention to download this App."
Amazon,Keep Working on It Amazon...Please!,Jason Dunn,10-May-12,3,"I really like Amazon's cloud music drive. I've uploaded all of my music to it - currently just under 16K songs - and I buy all my music from Amazon. So I should really love this app, right? No. First off, with the amount of music I have, I think in terms of genres. I don't think ""I want to hear artist XYZ today"", I think ""I'm in the mood for..."" and pick a genre, then pick an album or artist from that genre. The fact that Amazon doesn't allow me to select music by genre on this app is absolutely baffling. Please Amazon, add this feature. It's PAINFUL not to have it.Secondly, as someone who changes phones often (typically using overseas models) and lives in the USA, it's hugely frustrating that Amazon is so fiercely geographically fixated on only allowing the ""right"" version of this app on your phone, then logging you into Amazon.co.uk where none of your music exists. Yes, I'm an edge case, but come on Amazon - why do you have to cause me so much frustration? Just let me log into my account and let me play my music."
Amazon,Not compatible with Kindle HDX 8.5,Michelle E.A. Woolard,9-Dec-13,1,"Why would you make an app that's not compatible with your own devices? I'd say that's a big, fat fail, Amazon!"
Amazon,Where's the free streaming with Prime?,Tigersfan1065,27-Jul-17,1,"It sucks! How do I stream the ""millions of songs for free"" with my Prime membership? Poor application. Way to fool us into your massive benefits of Prime, Amazon.Everything wants me to pay another boatload of money for Music Unlimited. No thanks, not ever. Fool me once..."
Amazon,"The android app is lacking, no tone or equalization.",Phil A.,25-Dec-15,3,"This sounds like a great idea in theory. I have prime, I like music!  The thing is, the android app isn't that great.  There is no tone or equalization of any kind.  Too bad... I could really get on-board with the concept.  I'll keep buying my music, I guess."
Amazon,and really like the music,Bearair,18-Jul-17,1,"I've used this app for over a year, and really like the music.  HOWEVER, the last couple months I've been getting warnings about data usage from Verizon.  Every time I look for what's using data, I find that this app player is open and running.  I keep turning it off and it keeps turning the player back on in the background.  After removing the app, reinstalling it and removing it again, I've discovered that it was the reason my battery life is lousy.  Something in this app has started to run in the background, chew through battery and result in data charges.I used to really like this app and listened regularly for quite some time.  It's only the last 2 months that something in this app has been causing an issue.  In back to back testing with the app installed, then uninstalled (not using it at all), I went from having roughly 30% battery left at 5PM versus 70% battery left at 5PM.  Reinstalled the app, was back to 50% battery by noon yesterday, then removed the app.  Today I have 86% battery left at 1:30 PM.  The power figures I quoted are WITHOUT EVEN RUNNING THE APP.  If I used it, I had to recharge my phone before 4PM.  The phone was also always warm with the app installed, which is a sure sign of power usage.I'd say that's pretty definitive.  There is something running in the background that cannot be turned off.  It was eating my battery and eating my data.  It didn't do it until the last couple months, so they've changed something in the app. that's causing the issue.  I removed it from my phone and the phone is back to normal.  I will miss it as I used to use it regularly.  But, I don't like being spied on."
Amazon,disaster product,peachfront,12-Jun-17,1,"App won't ever install on my Samsung Galaxy 8, thus, I can't listen to mp3s I previously purchased from Amazon."
Amazon,Be warned that price equals bitrate,K. Z. Mahon,28-Apr-14,4,"===Update #2: Amazon has refunded my order fully :)Please understand that I am dissatisfied with the bitrates of the mo3s, and not the overall quality of the service.===Update: 4/29, and Amazon refunded me for the first album,  but none of the others, only because I forgot to note them in the initial contact;  I presumed Amazon would do so, seeing as I mentioned the number previously and my failing to mention them was my error.  I have emailed to request a complete refund, and will up the rating once this occurs.Note: I attempted to verify the bitrates on the album pages, but I was directed to AmazonMP3's app, which didn't offer any product details.I realize that I am being very OCD here,  but as a huge fan of both Amazon and the Archeophone Archives products,  as a consumer, I want the best quality possible. Give me that at a good price, and I'm very happy to spend all my fun money here :)===I bought 4 mp3 albums for the first time over the past few days, featuring acoustic-era phonograph music.  Given my past experience with Amazon,  I was greatly dissatisfied upon listening to the albums because they're 256kbps and I was expecting,  if not lossless FLAC, then at least full-320kbps.It may not be much of a difference,  but as a fan of this music, I am VERY disappointed on principle alone and would love a refund of these four $8.99 albums. I thought I was paying for full quality and I am not receiving it.This is my first low-star review for Amazon. com"
Amazon,Great app,Beardedone1984,10-Jul-16,5,Cool app despite what others say. Once you play a song fully you done need to download it at all. It will play in your offline music as if it was on your phone. Very useful
Amazon,Four Stars,Howard,5-Aug-17,4,Good app. Just stop trying to up sell people. Just have all the music included.
Amazon,"Why, if it's ""free"" do I have to put ...",Amazon Customer,12-May-16,1,"Why, if it's ""free"" do I have to put my credit card info in to download this app???  I have been burned once by unauthorized use of my Amazon music account and could not speak to a person who could understand English well enough to fix it so I ended up cancelling my whole account.  I do not want to put my credit card info in to listen to the ""free"" Ripped version of my album that came with the CD I just purchased.  I want another way to listen so HELP!"
Amazon,50/50 Player,The Nerdy Hillbilly,27-Oct-15,3,1. Very Good Quality And Design For Android2. Downloaded Prime Music Is Cleared Every Once In Awhile3. Slow To Load4. Protected M4a Can't Be Read On Other Players5. Constantly SYNCS
Amazon,the music is nice to listen to,Dan Ramirez,5-May-15,1,"the music is nice to listen to, at times. Then again eating up my high speed data can be somewhat annoying, if not loathsome. To me I see this app as the corporate version of napster. They would love to share their music with you and give it to you in an unlimited amount of empty files and constant commercials selling you something every other second from every direction in the form of music track and albums for sale. As well as other apps and other membership services. Basically it's a rent to own type deal letting you download certain tracks to your device without giving you full access to files and always giving the option to buy.  .... rent it as long as you like you never own anything unless you purchase it. You can't download to other devices aside form the device the app is installed in. The files being only accessible via the app so when your no longer a member there's no longer music it would seem. hmmm... something to think about."
Amazon,Good For My Needs - Recommended,C. Hill,17-Jun-12,4,"This ""Amazon MP3"" app provides a clean and easy interface to access the music files on my HTC EVO 4G or from the Amazon ""Cloud"". I use this app every night to play my ""Brown Noise"" for sleeping and generally whenever I want to listen music through my phone.Using the app is straight forward, with a simple layout and standard player controls. You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon ""Store"". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"
Amazon,Good Cloud Player but....,Robert S.,6-Mar-14,1,"This is a great way to play your music from the cloud. But if you want to take say 10GB of your favorite music and download it to your SD card so you can listen to it on the train without a data stream....well, you can't.Let's say your device has 5GB of onboard storage and you have a 64GB SD card. Where do you think this app would create its default download directory?  The local device of course. Well, just change the default download directory to the SD card and....oh wait a second, you can't. They don't permit this. So you buy their music and you can't store it on your SD card. Why do people buy SD cards in the first place? So they can store large files like photos, videos, and yes - MUSIC.  Good job Amazon, good job!"
Amazon,This update sucks,LolaRay,16-Oct-16,1,"I actually relatively liked this app until the most recent update. I deleted some songs off my phone and wanted to re-download them, only to find out that the option isn't available because on the app it lists it as already being downloaded. Not only that but the partner program on the computer has to have the most needlessly complicated way of uploading music to your Amazon music library, and that's if it even works. Literally worked fine the day prior, and now the program is barely running, and when it finally does run when I try and drag the songs I wanted to upload into my library, it says no songs were added."
Amazon,Trying to download your purchased music? good luck,Je,29-Jun-16,1,"They try to keep your music captive in Prime.If you've purchased music and downloaded it to your offline library, you may not see it in your other apps that you actually play music it.If you have a problem with the app, they'll tell you to delete everything and you'll have to re-download all your music, that can be hundreds to thousands of songs.Support is outsourced. They told me to logon to amazon and delete the music from there and try to re-download.That will actually permanently delete your music and you'll lose it forever.The app has no EQ so you'll have a less enjoyable music experience unless you play through another app."
Amazon,It sure would be nice to browse my library on the FireTV once again,Craig Clayton,12-Feb-17,1,"I've been using Prime Music and even pay for the annual subscription to have Amazon host all the music I own. Since the latest update to the FireTV I can't access Amazon music. I just gives me a message that I need to update it, but I have yet to find a way to do that. It sure would be nice to browse my library on the FireTV once again. I love the new FireTV OS interface but if this keeps up I might as well go back to my Roku."
Amazon,Unavailable for Kindle Fire???,H. Herrmann,16-Jan-16,1,Is this an Amazon product? WTH!? I use this app on my android phone and have playlists set up and everything. But heaven forbid I actually try to use this on an actual Amazon tablet. Ridiculous! I am seriously disappointed.
Amazon,Waste until they let one use external storage,Amazon Customer,16-Jun-14,2,"Good idea. But takes all your memory if you download to listen without streaming. Amazon let us use SD storage for the music, otherwise it's a waste to have this app."
Amazon,Great variety of music,Chris,26-Apr-17,5,"Great variety of music, but Amazon should not charge extra for some songs, I already pay PRIME, what is the point.????"
Amazon,Needs serious improvement,D. Calcagno,25-May-15,1,"While I enjoy the radio stations on my iPhone, its not exactly the best app as far as navigation goes.  It is far too complicated to go backwards and ""like"" a song and often ends up in repeating a song over or restarting the song I was listening to.  Pandora is much simpler to use.  I also am disappointed in my ""cloud"" albums.  I've bought MANY a CD from Amazon before streaming became the ""thing"" and VERY few albums are actually available to listen to.  I originally thought the idea that my music that I've purchased over the years being available to be all the time without having to load up space on my phone or always carry my iPod around was a great idea, now with such limited choices, I'm no longer impressed.  My other REAL ISSUE with this app is its own incompatibility with Amazon Fire Stick.  Why in the world would amazon make an App that isn't compatible with one of its own devices?"
Amazon,"Living outside the U.S., I can't use it.  :(",DanO,21-Aug-17,2,"Well, this app is probably great if I lived in America.  Since I live South Korea I cannot download this app because it's blocked.  If it ever becomes available for download here I will update my review.  Until then..."
Amazon,Better than nothing,Alejandro Barreda,31-Dec-16,3,"Better than nothing, no variety, the streaming many times doesn't work, need improvement on selection, just copy the software from Pandora and this will be great."
Amazon,Cool Service...Great Addition For Prime Members...Horrible Usability (It's not user friendly),JOSH HOELKER,30-Oct-14,3,"Prime Music is good, it's cool, it's great....but you think a company like Amazon.com would have thought to invested more of its BILLIONS OF DOLLARS into actually testing usability of the product (both desktop & mobile). It's obvious they didn't spend enough time on the service, and its a poor reflection on it's customer-centric brand promise (Or Jeff Bezos needs to rethink who's running Prime Music). I gave three starts only because the music is free, great sound quality, and its a convenient addition to my prime membership.That being said, I am not impressed with the service. It's too difficult to find the music you want and its ridiculous that you have to add prime songs to your library to listen to the full song. I'll give them some credit because the service is fairly new, but COME ON MAN! YOU ARE AMAZON.COM! If you're going to compete with Spotify, Pandora, and soon to be YouTube then compete. I'm giving it a chance, but wont be surprised is I revert back to using the unpaid Spotify service. As a prime member, I demand more & I expect more specially when it comes to music."

Amazon,Good to worse,BookReviewer,28-Nov-16,1,"I recently updated app (nov.2016) and app is terrible. Cuts off and on constantly  while listening to a  track.  Very disappointing.  It was a great app, now terrible."
Amazon,Good product,SeeKeen,3-Sep-17,5,Definitely worthwhile - I use it in the car while traveling.
Amazon,Here we go AGAIN,Gemzzz,16-Jun-14,1,"Another bloated, oversized app with 32 permissions, ridiculous lack of features, wants to sit on the memory of the internal SD, and is unfriendly to older smartphones.  Just another Prime ""benefit"" that is totally unusable because, once again, Amazon hired The Three Stooges to develop the app that runs it.  Nyuck THAT.Amazon - If you want families to begin flocking to your Prime club, make the benefits available to ALL ITS MEMBERS and for ALL DEVICES, or they feel cheated for the price they're paying you for Prime, especially after the INCREASE. Got an email today saying this music service is now available for Prime members, so get ready for the big disappointment when the Prime members realize it's just another component that is seriously lacking and not adding to the reasons why one should subscribe."
Amazon,Can't say much because I didn't even know about the ...,Always April,5-Jun-16,5,Can't say much because I didn't even know about the music until now and Iv been paying for Google music every month.
Amazon,Love this app.,cathy graeve,22-Jun-16,5,"I really like Amazon Music.it keeps track of my library, easy to find songs and albums, has a lot of great songs and albums for free. I am very pleased with this app. Would recommend it to my family and Friends."
Amazon,Great App!,Kenneth F.,3-Sep-15,4,"Considering the music is ""free"" with a prime account, I find it an incredible value.  Entire albums download very quickly and can be saved or offline use as not to drain your data.I give it four stars, for now, because I have only been using it a few days, and am having some trouble navigating and performing different task.  I do not see any ""help"" icons."
Amazon,This is absolutely the worst app EVER,Amazon Customer,19-Sep-15,1,This is absolutely the worst app EVER. Unfortunately I other prime featurez all the time so I  not going to subscribe to a different service.Music will skip when playing from cloud or offline libraries after playing 10-12 songs. I had been fixing it by killing the prime music app and restarting it (hmm just like windows). Support or lack there of has been trying to fix it for more than two months now. Last solution was to upgrade to version 4.6.2. Swing and miss. Now the player controls no longer display on my lock screen. Yet another undocumented feature.If you are. Not already a prime member or looking to become a prime member for the streaming music? DO NOT DO IT!!!I had to give the app one star in order to post the review and its not worth that. Should have a negative 5 star option
Amazon,"I want to love it, but no learning radio function like pandora? No thanks.",Kevink,29-Apr-16,2,"It has great sound quality, but it is very difficult to use. You have to know exactly what you want to listen to. I don't understand why they don't incorporate an intuitive radio player that you can enter several artists into and then rate played songs to have it learn what to play, basically just like pandora. If they could do this I'd be all in. I will still use prime bc there are MANY other benefits and utilization's for it.If an amazon customer service person see's this, let me know if there is something like this available, bc I REALLY want to use it, the controls and interface (in browser) are just very non-intuitive, much like the rest of amazon's website."
Amazon,Just finished talking with Verizon why all of a sudden ...,Amazon Customer,11-Aug-14,1,Just finished talking with Verizon why all of a sudden I had data overages.  We analyzed my phone and their network to see what the problem was.  It was Amazon Music.  I downloaded the app about a month ago and looked at it once.  The app ran up 3.6GB of data usage in the background (for what I haven't a clue) without me ever hearing a note.  This app appears to be dangerous.  I uninstalled because you can't trust that it's not pulling data from Amazon servers.  have no issues with Google Play. Luckily Verizon understood since I only use about .5GB a month and this app pulled 3.6GB for no apparent reason.
Amazon,"Decent app, subpar widget and notifications",M. Thomas,29-Jun-14,3,"As a prime subscriber, I was pleased to have this additional service added. I don't enjoy making playlists, and I always opt to use premade or instant playlists. Amazon offers playlists that cater to my tastes, and which include some songs I like that I don't otherwise have in my library. In that respect, I really like what Amazon has brought to the table. That said, I do have a few issues with the app. Streaming on my PC is perfectly fine, but the streaming playback on my Android phone is always choppy at the beginning of each song. My LTE coverage is perfectly good, and Google Play has never had trouble streaming on my phone. My second issue with the app is that it wipes out the active playlist after a few hours of being paused. I want to get out of work and just push play and pick up where I left off. I don't want to have to find that playlist again and figure out where I was. The last issue I have is that the notification tray play button doesn't work for me. This might have to do with the fact that my playback is always paused via unplugging an auxiliary audio cable, but the play button should work regardless. I don't have too much to say about the fullscreen app itself, as I only use it to pick my playlist."
Amazon,Redesign needed deserpately,rkclayton,18-Jun-15,2,"I want to love this service so bad.  It has a good selection of music and its included with prime so whats not to love?  I'll tell you...The entire set up is garbage.  I don't know who they hired to design it but it is the most complicated way to listen to music that I have found to date.  Before you can listen to songs you must ""add"" them to your library which then forces you to go to another screen to listen to them.  What if you just want to listen once?The mobile app doesn't allow you to search by Artist.  SERIOUSLY?They need to drop the shopping cart idea and take a good look at Google music.  I don't want to jump through hoops to listen to music, It should just work with little effort.  This is coming from someone who works in IT; sure I can figure all this out but I shouldn't have to.  Google music all the way"
Amazon,Better than not having music,justinjpogue,15-Jul-15,3,"It plays the music, and has a lot free on it in addition to what I've got privately and what I've purchased through Amazon, so all of that is great.  Additionally, it's free with Prime, so unlike competitor's apps (Spotify), I'm not paying $9.99 a month for this.  That having been said...I use Spotify 90% of the time, and Amazon Prime Music the other 10%, largely only for music Spotify doesn't have.  It's all in the UX/UI:  The interface here leaves most things to be desired, and that's the whole ball game."
Amazon,It is a good app for Amazon's first time doing a app with ...,James V,12-Nov-14,4,"It is a good app for Amazon's first time doing a app with prime music. Yes it has it's problems. Music cuts out from time to time. On my nexus5 phone and the app does not work on some devices like my monster cable M7 tablet just loads and loads but does not play music. ""Note all my products are brand new so it is the app.""Also this app is not setup for roku at this time. Amazon has lots of work ahead of them but the idea is there for a great prime music app just need to get it to work in more ways then one. Hope to see more from amazon soon."
Amazon,Slow. Unresponsive. Disappointing.,Larry E Moore Jr,2-Oct-17,1,"Super slow. I've contacted Amazon several times, but it just sits and loads. Wait up to a minute or more just to get it to show my artists, then after opening the album another 30 seconds or more to recognize what song I tap. After that it can take another minute to actually play. I'm switching to Google play.Tried the uninstall reinstall route several times. All it yielded me was having to redownload my music and ended with the same result."
Amazon,App has great features and is easy to navigate.,Nashy,31-Oct-15,5,"This app is very easy to navigate and shop. Easily add individual songs or entire albums to customizable playlists. Stream music or download to your device, filter options are great too. Set up options include automatic downloading of purchases and download locations (i.e internal or SD card) There is an optional widget for my home screen which shows album covers and I really like the one touch to play capability. Very pleased with this app."
Amazon,"I have one issue, but it's a BIG issue ...",Kevin,29-May-17,3,"I have one issue, but it's a BIG issue.  Amazon Music does not maintain playlists across devices/PC.  Songs that I add to a playlist on one device or my PC are added to one giant list of 'recently added' in the cloud.  When I move to a different instance of the app, I have to move the songs to the playlist again.  This alone kills it for me."
Amazon,App Crashes Tablet...,JP,2-Apr-12,1,"Used this app for about a month now but have not had it successfully work during that time. The app will launch momentarily and then force close. Following this my tablet will be sluggish until I reboot it. Through process of trial and error I stopped all apps and narrowed it down to when this particular app runs, it causes an issue. I've attempted fresh installs and clearing the cache but none of this has been successful. Even reading somewhere that the app was not compatible with equalizers, which I would hope has at least been accommodated by this point; disabling the equalizer features has been unsuccessful. After these problems and no fix, I just uninstalled it."

Amazon,Amazon needs to fix this,medusa_woman,13-Nov-14,2,"It seems that the better this app gets, the more it crashes or doesn't play music.  I sit in the same spot every day -- at work -- with the same device -- 6 months ago, it played fine -- (I'm talking about music in the cloud only -- music that I downloaded works fine).  Now it locks up or it just doesn't play music at all -- it attempts to play, but then skips to the next song.  Real frustrating.  I'm satisfied with the music selection -- I don't expect to have everything, so that's ok.  Love the playlists and the flexibility of arranging them on my PC.  But Amazon really needs to work on this cloud issue.  For the record, each morning, I restart my phone and clear my cache -- my phone is about 85% filled -- so I believe the issue is the Amazon.  They need to get on this or lots of us are going to go to Spotify, Pandora etc.  In addition, I'm also have playback problems watching shows on my TV -- again, I didn't have this problem 6 months ago.  If it doesn't clear up soon, I may not renew next year."
Amazon,How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways....,Chris,18-Dec-11,1,"First, let me say: I have an Amazon Kindle Fire -- and I love it. This app is NOT the app that runs on the Kindle Fire. This app is, instead, what you run on an Android phone/tablet. With that being said:This app is crap. It's entire focus is to get you to BUY music, rather than stream music from your Amazon Cloud Drive. The app is incredibly commercial-centric. From the moment you start it up you're given two choices/buttons: Cloud Drive Music or Store. Each time you boot it up, you get the same two stupid buttons: Cloud Drive or Store. The ""Store"" is ever present, regardless of where  you may be within the app. What's more, the app continuously crashes hangs on my multiple devices: LG Optimus Slider, Motorola Triumph, and XOOM tablet. Regardless of whether you are using Froyo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, etc. EXPECT crashes and hangs. This app is total, total worthless crap if you have a lot of music on your Cloud Drive (like I do).Amazon could do sooo much better.... Again: Total crap."
Amazon,We really love Amazon music,Woods Family,24-Sep-17,4,"We really love Amazon music. The ONLY reason I am giving it a 4 is that we have a large family of 8 and we cannot all use the service because it is limited to only a few devices. Please, please, please increase the number of devices in general or consider making exceptions for larger families, even if proof is needed that the  members are living in same household or something like that. It would be fair if it allowed for a maximum number being the members of a family (ours is 8). Many thanks for an otherwise FANTASTIC service!!!"
Amazon,Google Play has more recent version of this app?,Mr. Freeze,14-Jul-16,1,Sad that the most recent version of this app is available only from Google Play. Why Amazon releases to Google Play FIRST - before making it available on their  own Appstore - is inane - and inconvenient - as packages are signed with different keys.
Amazon,Selfish capitalist motives > terrible version 5.0,lindros,14-Oct-16,1,"This is an absolute disaster. I can't use the app, can't listen to my music (I pay $25/year for the library/matching), and all in the name of some selfish person at Amazon who decided to launch Unlimited and clog up what used to be a great app.Wasn't QA'ed. App crashes. Consumes 26% of CPU and 190MB of RAM on a PC.Mac app equally crashes.Android version won't install."
Amazon,Difficulty using it.,Barbara H.,5-Jun-16,2,"Actually, I am having trouble making good use of it so that is why I don't like it."
Amazon,Love the service. Here's a suggestion for liking stuff and providing more feedback on the jams in playlists!,M. Ruby,5-Jun-15,5,"Hey Amazon - GREAT JOB with Amazon Prime Music. I'm loving the curated playlists and the music that is on them. In general there is a great selection of music in Prime.One piece of feedback... I can't do much more to interact with the playlists than rate a playlist overall. I listen to the playlists when I'm at work and have been finding that there are times where I'm liking the music so much I want to ""like"" or give some sort of feedback live. I've been using Periscope a lot lately and have been the digging the ability to tap little hearts during the live broadcasts. That would be pretty cool to do when I'm listening to Amazon Prime music and you could get more feedback on how people are liking the jams.Keep up the good stuff! This product is moving the right direction and keeps getting better and better."
Amazon,Could be better.,J. W,10-May-17,3,I like it but it could be easier to use complicated for a new user. So get to work Amazon.
Amazon,Best diversity I have heard in years with NO commercials....,S. Williams,9-Jun-17,5,"I love music and diversified genres,,,,this works fantastic....Stations have a fantastic playlist and my clients love the spa music....This is definitely a keeper for listening to music."
Amazon,Great app for music!,KP,6-Dec-15,5,This is an awesome app. There are too many pros to list but I will name a few. I can listen to any of my music I downloaded from Amazon without downloading the tracks to my phone. All my music is right where I can easily access it. The only con I hace found is that deleting songs from the library is a little harder. You have to delete each individual one and there is no way to select large batches to delete that I have found. Not much of a con so this app still gets 5 stars from me.
Amazon,Not a fan,Yasosume,21-Feb-16,1,"I like the idea, but I feel like this app drains my battery faster than any other music app on my phone. One good thing about it is that you could download the songs into your device after purchasing them so you don't have to use the player it has."
Amazon,Continues to use Mobile data,Mikey,13-Jun-14,1,"WARNING UPDATE - THIS APP CONTINUES TO USE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MOBILE DATA EVEN WHEN CONFIGURED TO USE WIFI ONLY. It amounts to 1-3 mb per day. This appears to happen even when it is not being used. Uninstalled!This would be a 5 star for me, but I can't see how to remove downloaded albums from the device. Downloaded playlists can be removed, but not albums. I had to remove each individual song one at a time, this took several minutes due to the slow toast notifications"
Amazon,not a fan,Kendell ThatsMe,9-Jun-16,1,I canceled my subscription for prime music section not a fan of and you still have to buy it.
Amazon,I love it!,Alice Marshall Swing,11-May-17,4,"I love it!! I can access virtually anything I want, also it's a great way to fall asleep listening on my Echo!!"
Amazon,Horrible. I cannot believe how bad this is,Carri,12-Dec-14,1,"Horrible. I cannot believe how bad this is. Have the app developers or Amazon actually checked out how Pandora/Amazon/Spotify/Slacker work? I'm guessing not. Incredibly frustrating. I am very knowledgeable about Android phones and apps. Very. I support them at my job.All I want to do it play some music. Period. Pick a genre. It takes you to that Genra and a little popup comes up: SAMPLE PLAYLIST? No. I just want to listen to it.Add to my playlist. Go to Playlists. It's not there.Maddening. It took me far too long to figure out how to play a song... but then it's got to be specific songs. I JUST WANT TO HEAR MUSIC IN ONE GENRE. Surprise me. Find em some new music.Oh...look at that. The ""playlist"" I am listening to just stopped after one song that I added. Really?Already a Prime Member, so I am VERY glad I didn't get Prime just for this. 'Do not let this be a deciding factor over whether or not you go buy Prime."
Amazon,This is one of the free good deals. I know there is a membership involved,Pixelfreak,13-Apr-15,5,"living in a world where nothing is free, This is one of the free good deals. I know there is a membership involved, but consider how much music cost and everthing prime offers, free shipping on most items, free books and current editions.free apps.Cloud storage. acoss all my devices. This music is not old one hit wonders nor music nobody would buy, All the current top artist and no.1 hits, Complete albums and Grammy award artist from every genre, Rap to country and classicical,  It's about time we got something free for out hard earned money."
Amazon,Less Than Happy,Rich S,23-Jan-17,2,"I am not too well familiar with online music sites, but I found Amazon Music to be more than confusing.  There really aren't any ""instructions"" to walk me through the process of selecting music and sharing it with other devices.  I still haven't figured out how to link Amazon Music with my home Wi-Fi network and/or surround sound system.  In addition, when I access Amazon Music using my Samsung Tablet, the site keeps crashing."
Amazon,Where's the support?,Mary Bonner,20-Jun-14,1,"I attempted to use Amazon Music with my Prime Membership and spent a couple of hours trying to get some helpful support from customer service.  I downloaded the App to my IPAD  from my App Store and when I tried to access some music, I received a message that I needed to sign up for Amazon Music.  I then downloaded what seemed to be the same App from Amazon, which came with a credit.  Then came the support merry-go-round.  My first rep was difficult for me to understand, very slow to understand me and didn't seem knowledgeable which was understandable since he was in Africa.  After getting an American rep, I was no more successful.  I have received two, not one email welcoming me to Amazon Music, so I guess I had registered but still no clarity on the error message. i QUIT.  Too bad Amazon didn't provide the ease of use that they have with Prime video."
Amazon,"Amazing app, unless used with a Roku, so sad.",Evelyn S,4-Jun-15,3,"This is a fabulous app when you have a prime membership.  Unfortunately, full functionality is not available on my Roku device.  Unlike my Smartphone and iPad, you can't access all of the other wonderful music options, all you can access is your own library.  For me, this is a shame because my phone and iPad are not hooked up to my home stereo, while the Roku device is. PLEASE, PLEASE,  Amazon make your apps have the same functionality no matter what device they are being used with.  I hope that you will work with Roku to fix this. That is the reason I couldn't give this app 5 stars."
Amazon,"Not good, but usable",NevermoreFU,20-Jun-14,3,"Needs:-Set download location to SD card-Landscape Mode-Show cloud and downloaded music in the same list (Google Music does this well)-When clicking on an Artist, don't just show all the songs, have options for ""All Songs"" and ""Albums"" (like Google Music and the iPhone)  when I have a band that has 15 albums, a giant list of songs is not very easy to sort through.  Obviously this is designed for people who buy singles (shame on you).Prime music is pretty awesome, but I'm running out of space quick and the app is a hassle to use.  Worth it for ""free"" music though."
Amazon,Cloud Music,Michael Kerner,6-Aug-14,4,"There is no question that Amazon.com has definitely been a great superstore for online shopping, but it also has been a great shopping source for purchasing online music as well. But nevertheless, they have also started the trend of keeping your music safe with storage and with your shopping from buying music on CD's and digital music, you can store all of it on their website online music cloud. It handles fairly well, at keeping your music safe so if you can download it over again, and have your autorip music stored here, so if your buying for your friends or keeping your online music safe, this handles well as a must app for your Android devices and Kindle Fire as well. Sadly though, it doesn't have enough recognition with tablets Micro SD cards to play back the music stored there. Also, it could have better playback for when you are playing your cloud-stored music through Wi-Fi. But it still is a great add-on for your Android tablets, but more could've been highlighted.Price: BConvience & Setup: B-Overall: B-"
Amazon,End the feud,Geoff,7-Aug-17,2,"App works fine, but Amazon needs to end its feud with Google and get this app in the Play store. Unnecessarily difficult to install this app on a non-Amazon device. Shame on you, Amazon."
Amazon,Great for ios (from Apple Apps) as well (though with some limitations),Zenon P,4-Sep-17,5,"It says it is for an Android but I got it from iTunes and it works great on an iPhone7 -- except it will not get ""Music Unlimited"" or at least I don't know how to get those (e.g. Olivia Chaney)."
Amazon,I would like to see better searching within prime music,Cameron Braidwood,30-Oct-15,4,"I'm really enjoying your prime service. However, I would like to see better searching within prime music, and that facility to be available on the prime tv box, as I would like to explore your free music in a less random way. In particular, I would like to be able to search for music by duration, as I like to find DJ mix's often included on dance compilations. This is easy to do on soundcloud, but not on prime music. And , as mentioned before, I would really like to search for music via my fire tv box, and listen to it on my TV / sound system in my living room. At the moment, you only have access to albums you have in your collection, or playlists you have added to your prime music account ... you cant generally search."
Amazon,Not what it was,Charles H. Griswold,21-Apr-17,1,"With the advent of Amazon Music, almost anything you want to listen to on Prime is gone, and what's left is junk.Just a scam to get you for $10 a month.Boo Amazon."
Amazon,Works,Amazon Customer,5-Nov-14,4,"It's a nice app, but it has a few bugs. I accidentally downloaded a very large play list form the cloud filling up my tablets storage. Seems there should be a ""do you really want to do this"" window before starting the download.At first this app didn't work with my new Dell Tablet. After several calls to Amazon the problem was solved. I bought the Tablet form Amazon so this problem should of been solved before hand."
Amazon,More Tunes Please,Knight,15-Feb-17,4,"Would give it Five but it needs more listening options, feels odd paying for Prime just to be told to pay for another Prime to hear more...kinda defeats the purpose"
Amazon,"Seems good, but some major artists missing (like UNKNOWN HINSON)",CMbassist,2-Feb-15,4,"Have not tried downloading or cloud playing, but the streaming music is high quality and has some advantages over Pandora... Namely being able to listen to full albums and playlists of individual artists without forced ""variety"". Biggest issue so far- NO UNKNOWN HINSON! Seriously... UNKNOWN HINSON is the KING of Country and Western Troubadors (doubt it? Google it!). How can they even have country music on here and not include the King?! I am sure other artists are missing as well, but it is imperative to include Unknown! Squeaking by on Hank III, even though the edited versions of his songs come up first. It is cool that censored and uncensored versions are available... As a parent, I like that. Battery usage seems comparable to Pandora. No ads (yay)! Just started using this today... So far pretty good. But, seriously- ADD UNKNOWN HINSON! Then this would be great!"
Amazon,Great features!,D. Romero,17-Oct-17,5,I like the listen off line feature.
Amazon,gotten worse,just a thought,25-Jun-14,1,"Previous to the ""Prime Music"" being intertwined with the player/downloader I thought this was a great app.  I used it on my iphone 4s with very few problems.  It ran on my Samsung Galaxy in the same manner.  Now I absolutely abhor this app.  Trying to download an album without the 1000 error code is not possible for me.  Now instead of trusting that the entire album has been downloaded I need to double check.  It is not my network connection nor the network.  I run in to these problems at home, work, even when running 4G as the only wireless connection.  I now have a note 3 and these same problems persist.  Not impressed at all.There are other issues with the app such as when the ""red exclamation"" (indicating a download error) icon appears on the ""Song"" line.  Quickly touching this icon should take you to a pop up screen asking if you want to retry or cancel the download.  Half of the time when I hit that button the player opens and tries to play the song.  Very annoying when you are in a meeting and trying to stay awake:)"
Amazon,"Like the service, Android App rather disappointing",Amazon Customer,1-Dec-14,2,"Like the prime service over all, but rather disappointed in not being able to store music on the SD Card. Really have trouble believing that this use case wasn't brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common.  I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card (world readable, 777 all that) is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music (I'm guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there).  All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method won't last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see What's on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."
Amazon,0 Stars should be an option,Squeaky D,2-Jun-15,1,"It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song, meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST, so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away, so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as ""Free"" music. I never thought I could dislike a music service more than Pandora... but this takes the poo cake."
Amazon,This thing is awful,jeff c,25-Mar-14,1,"I used to use this app a lot. I even spent the 25 bucks to get the expanded Amazon cloud storage and I have uploaded most of my music collection to my Amazon cloud account.  In the old days I could access any song in my collection with a tap on the screen and instantly be enjoying my music.Life was so carefree back then. Then one day THE UPDATE came. Now this app is a wasteland, destroyed by code. It might play a song if I tap on it, but most likely it isn't going to. You can try to play other songs but they probably aren't going to play either. And you know those songs you have saved on your SD card... well they might as well not exist anymore if you're stuck using this app. I hate this app with an unhealthy passion. I think it's mostly because I feel like I've been betrayed by something I once loved.I did find a work around to these problems. I bought an ipod classic. It doesn't hold all my music, but it holds a lot, it doesn't need wi-fi and best of all it plays music when I want to listen to it, not when it feels like it.  Next year I'll save 25 bucks by not renewing my Amazon cloud account. So I've got that going for me, which is nice."
Amazon,"It installed fine, would play music but whenever I went to ...",Obviousman,20-Sep-14,2,"I downloaded the Amazon Music Installer app because when I bought a few albums on Amazon I was entitled to download / stream them. Whenever i clicked on the ""play or download you music now"" link I got an Amazon message telling me there was an error: ""Music library error - we encountered an internal error. We are working to resolve this problem as soon as possible. Please close your music library and try again later.""After waiting 24 hours for this error to clear I figured the issue might be that I didn't have the Amazon music player installed. It installed fine, would play music but whenever I went to the Amazon store via the music player I still got the same error. I tried using three browsers with the same result.erhaps my issue is not the fault of the music player app but as a ""Joe Average"" user I don't care about the technical details; I just 'see' that I don't get what I was expecting and thus rate the app poorly."
Amazon,CAN NOT PLAY MUSIC ON MORE THAN 1 DEVICE!!!,Josh,19-Oct-16,1,"CAN ONLY PLAY MUSIC ON 1 DEVICE AT A TIME. Can not play on multiple devices simultaneously. If you have more than one echo, dot, tap, phone etc. you can only listen to music on one device - the others will give an error message if you try and won't play ANY music! We have an echo in several locations in our house, at work, and the app on our iPhones. All devices are unable to play any music if any one other device is using the service. No way to cancel the trial membership either (you can cancel after 30-day-trial ends....). THIS IS A JOKE AMAZON!"
Amazon,Not ready for prime time (i.e. really crappy),jfb,23-Nov-16,1,"This software is total crap as far as I can tell.  I run a Mac Mini with the latest OS on it (10.12.1 as of this review), and all this Amazon Music software shows me is a blank screen.  Not responsive to any commands, I have to force quit.  I deleted all the plist files, preferences, etc, reinstalled, no change.  I've been using PC's and Mac's since they first came out, and I'm pretty handy with them.  This software is not ready for primetime.It's easier to launch a browser window and listen to music through the web app."
Amazon,"Freezes constantly, not worth the frustration",Amazon Customer,18-Aug-17,1,"The app on my phone loses its connection and pauses/freezes the music all the time when I'm trying to play my playlists. I don't have this problem with Soundcloud, Spotify, Youtube or other streaming music services so it has nothing to do with the internet connection. It happens almost every time during or after the first song. It's so frustrating and I end up switching to Youtube or another service that I know won't have problems. Not worth paying to have access to unlimited music if Amazon freezes it after one song....."
Amazon,Use for streaming cloud library,DJ Farji,27-Aug-16,4,"Enjoy the app, but only use for streaming my cloud library.  A desired enhancement is ability to play songs on phone acquired from other sources."
Amazon,new app is clunky not likin' it,chris smith,18-Jun-14,1,"uploaded just a few days ago the upgrade is similar to a recent spotify upgrade that i'm also unhappy with re menu and interactivity. but unlike spotify's killer graphics and overall look, the amazon music app is clunky and quite frankly it's ugly. my guess is that unless it changes very soon, i won't be buying as much music on it cuz it's not intuitive for me and i can't find things quickly. the prime feature is also very weak, with not much being offered, just like on prime video which i hardly use. is amazon trying to kill prime? i'm already planning not to renew in the coming year."
Amazon,Memory Hog,Dusty14,2-Feb-14,2,"For those who have accumulated a lot of MP3s in Amazon's cloud and want to access them anywhere, this is essential, but it is frustrating that they didn't put more thought into it.  There is no way to set the storage to be the first place it should look - the SD card! If you want to take some MP3s for use off-line, they quickly fill up the main device storage. You have to keep deleting them and downloading them again, or take the trouble to move them back and forth yourself. If they would take the time to fix this, it would be great."
Amazon,"Despite listed specs, does not work with Android 4.1 / tablet sold via Amazon Prime",ekacnap,1-Jul-14,1,"Despite the listed specs, this app will not currently load on at least one Android 4.1 tablet sold via Amazon Prime:  http://www.amazon.com/Double-Power-GS-918-Certified-Android/dp/B00DOJIZF6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1404259734&sr=8-2&keywords=double+power+tabletVERY disappointing as I bought the tablet based on the stated specs of this particular app (Android 4.0 and higher) - but hopeful Amazon programmers will soon create a work-around.Attempts to load the app currently result in the app defaulting to version 2.8.2 of Amazon MP3 player (no Prime music)."
Amazon,Works fine on my Ipad but not on my Android!,Luis,16-Jun-14,1,"My Android works with my Gmail Account, my IPad with my MSN Account. Whe I downloaded the App to my Android and Register it with my MSN Account which is the one on Amazon too, it does not show my Amazon Prime Status. Amazon can do a lot better than what they have!"
Amazon,No SD Support?  Really?,Dan D,26-Sep-14,2,"The old Amazon MP3 app automatically stored downloaded music to my SD card, but this new app doesn't even give me the option to do so, which is pretty ridiculous, given that I have a Verizon Elipsis 7 tablet with a 32GB SD card and less than 2GB of internal storage.  Is there any way to revert back to the old app, or is Amazon going to address this issue?  Having read the other reviews here, I can see that I'm not alone.  Please Amazon - it can't be that tough to add SD support, and your customers will be a heck of a lot happier!"
Amazon,Amazon Prime Music Streaming is Broken,The Bird Man,17-Mar-16,1,"Amazon's ability to stream music during peak hours when people are home is suspect. We have a fairly fast network, >6Mbps, and while playing music at home in the evenings the music plays, stops, plays, stops, ...etc.  During this time we tested the network and all other streaming apps and everything looked and worked perfect.Nothing else was running on our network except Amazon Prime Music. To stream music takes very little bandwidth compared to streaming an HD Movie.  This normally means a home network for playing music is rarely the problem and more likely to be something overloaded/broken in the providers network."
Amazon,"Yawn... Oh look, I can find ...",DCase,22-Jul-15,1,"Yawn... Oh look, I can find 10-20% of what interests me. I have diverse tastes, but Prime Music is VERY limited. Having 1,000,000 songs available must mean you have to buy the other 100,000,000. I signed up for Amazon Prime because of the value added content of prime music, prime video, and prime books, one of which i can't even access and the other two of which add negligable value. I am not renewing my prime membership (you will have to call to do this as the day you can, buy there is nowhere to do this on there site. Either that or they have it buried in a dark, inconspicuous corner of their site.Prediction... Prime is the beginning of the decline for Amazon. They have seen the pinacle of success and its going to be a long, hard ride down."
Amazon,Find the Music in You!,Nick L.,23-Oct-17,5,Only started listening this week. Downloaded the Andriod App and the PC App. I've easily found all my favorite bands and like the Channels and mixes they've  made. So far...So Good!
Amazon,WHAT A WASTE OF MY LIFE!!!!!!,Jonathan Lake,31-Oct-14,1,"I have used this on a few occasions and it has worked fairly well. I come to use it this time and every time it makes me log back in there is no easy one click option on my amazon homepage to buy the mp3 I wanted. I had to search for it again then find that it was already in my mp3 basket but I couldnt get to my mp3 basket!!!!! Wasted an age on this........wait it continues.Then when I have bought it I try to download it to my computer and after updating a particular internet explorer it then tells me I need to down load amazon mp3 downloader, which I have but needs updating!!!!! So I update this then it after all that it no longer seems to let me download the song and I cant get it to come up on my newly updated amazon mp3 downloader!!!! WHAT IS THE POINT OF GIVING THIS MASSIVE MULTINATIONAL ANY OF MY MONEY IF THEY CANT SORT THIS BASIC THING OUT! VERY VERY VERY UNIMPRESSED!!!! I WILL STICK TO ITUNES FROM NOW ON"
Amazon,Amazon music,Amazon Customer,18-Oct-17,5,Loved it just too expensive.
Amazon,No need for iTunes now!!!,S. Sherwood,2-Dec-15,5,"I have been using this app on a Fire HDX, Samsung S5 and now a iPhone 6s. At first it was a little hard to understand, but now that I spent the time to learn it, I love it. I have never used the iTunes with my new phone. I have been able to load some of my old music to my library and plan to add more. The selection is always growing. You can download the music to the device so you can play it when offline as well. I had no problem with the app on my Kindle Fire as others have reported. It is true the music from prime is only able to be played in the prime player but that has never been an issue for me. Spend a little time, figure it out and I think most will find something to like."
Amazon,The BEST in the BIZ,THyde,7-Mar-17,5,"I have Napster and ITunes as well as Amazon. By far, Amazon offers a wider choice, seamless downloads, easy playlist set-ups and tailors their weekly music choices to a ""T"" for my exact preferences. Not to mention, their sound quality FAR exceeds any other music app. PERIOD!!"
Amazon,Needs improvement,zachary,24-Aug-16,3,"It's okay, I like the x-ray lyrics function on most songs but wish they were on all of them . I also wish that when I look at the artist that there would be the entire discography not just a couple albums . I find the selection of music inadequate . When compared to Spotify Amazon prime music has a much inferior selection. I constantly have issues in which I cannot find a particular song, album, and/or artist I am looking for. Then to make it even worse many times when I'm looking for a particular song I find obnoxious remixes and covers that I want no part of."
Amazon,"Good app, good idea but lacking in content",duane wingell,3-Jan-16,2,"I primarily use Apple Music and some what am now a custom to the selection of music available in its store. Amazon music however, though is still relatively new lacks in up to date music, searching for popular music tends to yield no results which is slightly baffling. For this app to do well it needs to be able to take on its competitors and sadly doesn't quite do that. The app its self works lovely but without a good sizeable content library what's the point?"
Amazon,My go to music app.,katiemmoore25,30-Jun-16,4,Prime Music has changed my life and I am so happy that I have this service and having this app makes it so easy to use! I have used some of the other apps out there to stream music and this is by far the best one yet and the one I use most frequently. I love that I can go back and forth between my library and between Amazon playlists and stations. I haven't had any problems with this app excessively draining my battery but I do however experience some crashes. But restarting the app usually fixes that and my music is back up and running in no time time. I highly recommend this app!
Amazon,Confused by negative reviews,teariana,18-Apr-15,5,"I've been using this app for awhile on my Samsung Galaxy Ring and have no problem storing all my music in a file called music on my sdcard, while in the app you just click on ""device"" and it all comes up. I even have playlists, which although the list is set up in internal memory the music files remain in the ext sd file.  I did lose the playlists a couple of times but I think that was because I was using a memory cleaning program that I've since uninstalled because it also deleted some important files I had in what it considered an unimportant place. But everything works great, no need for Wi-Fi or data access to play anything downloaded to my ext sdcard. A for the refresh I've got it set up to do so only through Wi-Fi but even then it doesn't do it constantly, but that may be because I never use the cloud storage and/or cloud player."

Amazon,NEEDS MORE SPANISH MUSIC ALL GENRE,Christina,23-May-17,3,I would like more spanish music I search Spanish and i get like 3 titles of what knows what.  Then i search for an artist and its music is not prime etc.  I thought amazon serve all cultures but i guess not.  I still give it 3 stars because I like amazon but they can improve this app.
Amazon,You need Mr. BozoÛªs permission to listen to your downloaded music,Top Reviewer 4 now,9-Feb-16,1,"Apparently Mr. ÛÏBozo,Û AMZ founder and CEO, is a control freak who thinks he owns your music library, even after you have purchased and downloaded all of the songs. It is often not possible to open up Amazon Music to listen to your (downloaded) music without logging into Amazon (e.g. whenever they have a software update or just want to check up on you). ItÛªs not a stand alone player, so if you are offline and away from an Internet connection, you maybe out of luck.I finally switched to iTunes, which is not set up this way.

Amazon,Double charged for music,Amazon Customer,1-Dec-16,1,"I added a song on Amazon Prime Music (New Person, Same Old Mistakes by Tame Impala), then cancelled my Amazon Prime, so as expected I can no longer play that song. But then I purchased the entire MP3 album (Currents by Tame Impala) for $5.99 which is supposed to include that song (track 13), however, the Amazon music app still wouldn't let me play it! I had to pay an extra $1.29 to purchase that song, which is ridiculous because I already paid for the album and that track should have been included in the purchase."

Thought ""WOW this is better than Pandora, Can pick the songs I want to hear!""BUT - It turns out we can't save the music to the Installed SD card. Everything goes to the internal memory. What good is that! I have a 64gb card installed because I use my phone often more than my laptop. So I can nibble away at my data plan when not near a Wi-Fi or not bother with this system. Unless they update this issue soon I think most of us are throwing it away! Come on Amazon, You can let it send to the SD card. PLEASE!"
Amazon,"needs some work, not seamless with the Firestick TV",alexisd3000,12-Mar-16,3,"I am thrilled that there are so many offerings from Prime music, but disappointed that when playing the songs with my Amazon Firestick.  When using Amazon Music on the Firestick TV the play/pause, forward, and reverse buttons on my remote do nothing, unlike Pandora.  I also noticed that unlike Pandora on the Firestick TV, the artist and titles of the songs don't pop up when changing if in another app.  Seems Amazon did much less developing on this than Pandora did.  The playback seems to end songs prematurely every once in a while, too.  I have yet to try to access this library from a mobile device, I hope it works."

Amazon,"It is especially bad if, like me",Nello,28-Dec-15,1,"This software is not ready for prime. It is especially bad if, like me, you have a large music collection. I paid for the larger storage capacity, but so far I have not been able to upload even the amount I am allowed for free. The uploader constantly crashes. Then you have to restart and deal with all the duplicates from the first attempt.  If I can't get my thousands of tracks uploaded, this will be of little use to me. The only reason I bought the space in the cloud was so that my new Amazon Echo (which works MUCH better) could access most of my music collection. If I can't get the collection into the library in the first place, what's the point?"
Amazon,"Good in theory, poor execution.",Amazon Customer,3-Nov-17,1,"Got the app for a trip hoping to have music while in flight.  Unfortunately, the app pauses music every 15-20 seconds while using a Bluetooth connection.  Luckily my headset has a cord available to use as well, so I wasn't completely at a loss.  Upon returning home, I found to my dismay that it does the same on all Bluetooth connections, both of our personal vehicles as well as my work truck.  Unfortunately I'm going to return to Pandora."
Amazon,Used to be easy to use and lots of fun,Elaine,3-Dec-16,1,"Once again, overthought.  Used to be easy to use and lots of fun.  It is now virtually a nightmare to navigate.

You should really start paying attention to users."

That being said, I am very disappointed that I cannot choose whether to put the music on my internal drive or my sd card. I cannot get Internet or cell service at my job so streaming from the cloud is out of the question and playing my music offline from the internal memory just seems to run my battery down faster. Not to mention the amount of memory my music takes up. It just frustrates me to no end. I will keep the service because I order a lot of products from Amazon and for Amazon Kindle but I hope that they take all the negative feedback into account about the music memory problems and do something about it."

It took me a while to search and find that Amazon has changed/upgraded the app and changed its name.  Thought about downloading the new version....but would it overwrite all of my existing playlists?  LOTS of those to lose.  Also there were references to fees and charges for the new version of the player.  Called customer service and of course got transferred around before getting the information I need.What an unnecessary waste of time.  Instead of sending me an email before the switch, touting the latest features (and more selling opportunities for Amazon),  they made me mad, wasted their customer service agents' time, and BTW, I STILL don't know what the new features are.Useful to know: you cannot export a playlist from this player, or even print one for reference."

Woo hoo...Since becoming an Android user I've been tolerant of ""good enough"" music synchronization capabilities offered by other applications (including the upgrade/pro version ofåÊWinampåÊand doubleTwist. One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its ""AutoRip"" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an ""Amazon over iTunes store"" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive. Once you've made the decision to turn control of your music inventory over to Amazon...the rest is easy!"

""song""-limit ($25/year) so I could download my music to my Android phone, without putting any data on the phone itself (which wouldn't hold a fraction of this much data anyway).""Songs"" is in quotes, because most of my collection is classical, so a ""song"" could be less than a minute, to over 30 minutes in a symphony movement.It took FOREVER (well, 5 days) to download all this to the cloud, as the computer kept going to sleep if not monitored, but it went smoothly, and now I don't have to also carry my iPod with me on trips. I also liked the fact that Amazon bumps the bps from the 192 max on Apple, to 256. With a good pair of headphones you can hear the difference.I also REALLY liked the fact that Amazon gives you the album art, unlike Apple, which nickels-and-dimes you for everything ($1 for album art?

So that pretty much blew it for that feature.  Also the app just quits almost every time I get a call, or an alarm goes off or anything. I have to restart it and work my way back to what I was enjoying. Also it got locked into repeat mode somehow and it would only play the first song in any album. Had to re-install to fix it.

It is so extensive that u can find just about anything that you can imagine, and if you have a Prime membership, most if them are free.

I'm careful to NOT allow 3rd party javascript - what is this ""cloudfront"" place?  A hacker website?

WTF Amazon.  Do you guys not know when the 80's were?  How hard is it to write code that tells the station, if the song wasn't released between 1980 and 1989 then it's not 80's music....Your stations suck, and i'm going back to the free Pandora.

It is easy to make a playlist, find a song, play a song, buy a song, or whatever else you usually need to do with .mp3's.  I love it!I also love how it ties into the cloud services and allows me to download my .mp3 purchases with a few taps on the screen.Somebody had complained that you couldn't make a playlist with song both on your local device and from the cloud.  While this is true, you can easily download the songs onto your device and then add them to your playlist.  Easy peasy!The only thing I wish I could do is to bookmark songs within a playlist.  I would love it if they would add it as it would be really easy.  I like to listen to both .mp3 music files and audiobook files and having a bookmark feature would allow me to switch between music and the spoken word without loosing my place inside of a book.  Amazon: PLEASE ADD!!  I have purchased (yes, I paid money) another book reader, Ambling BookPlayer, for this feature alone.

For some reason this app only lets you download music to your internal memory.What does that mean you ask? Well, Android users have this awesome feature where you can add memory to your phone using a micro SD card. Usually we add these for apps like Amazon Music because music and video can take up a lot of memory. Especially if you're a music lover. For some reason this app doesn't allow you to save music to you SD memory, just your internal, which is usually only 16 gigs or so.If your device has a lot of internal memory then by all means go crazy with this app, it's pretty awesome. But if you have not that much internal memory to spare THEN AVOID THIS APP! IT WILL EAT YOUR MEMORY LIKE THE KLUMP'S AT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT!Until they fix it then I'll change my rating."
Amazon,"Great Service, Wish for a Feature Update",Adam Macaulay,10-Nov-16,5,I have been enjoying Amazon music since its release. I use it on all my devices and computers. The only issue I have found is that shuffle will play a song which has already been played in the playlist more than once before it plays all the other songs. I wish that it would make sure to play each song first before playing a song again. I'm sure this is something they will fix at some point in the future or at least give you a setting to control it. Otherwise it is a great service!

It's virtually impossible to browse anything--your own music, Prime content, the built-in store, anything. For one thing, the ""back"" button barely works. For another, the sort and search functions are woefully crude.Imagine everything awful about a piece of software and you have imagined the user experience of this program: pure frustration.Amazon, you really should be ashamed of this one."

I listen at work sometime, but after several hours, a message pops up saying that there's ""limited to no connection"" - then it won't play; however, my other Internet connections are good. Trying to reconnect through Amazon gives a ""having technical difficulties that they're working on repairing"" message. If this hadn't happened several times, I would have given Amazon Prime Music 5 stars."
Amazon,"Doesn't work. Exception #117, NO FIX IN SIGHT",Cameron Haag,2-Feb-17,1,"Can't even access the app. I receive an exception #117 error. I called customer service weeks ago to resolve it to no avail. They said they're moving it up the chain and will contact me to fix it. Still hasn't been resolved. I am a prime member and this app is a big reason I am a prime member and I can't even use it. I shouldn't even have to be paying for Prime if I can't use it's features.Not sure what they did, the app used to work for me awhile back."
Amazon,I love the flow from my library to my phone,Claude Shockley,11-Aug-16,5,"I love the flow from my library to my phone. I have used Amazon Music on my computer for years and never had a major problem. Give it a try, you might just like it."
Amazon,Five Stars,review,10-Jun-17,5,hum a few bars -- a nice app
Amazon,Four Stars,T. Keesee,3-May-17,4,Limited compared to the competition.
Amazon,which was cool since this app isn't that great,D Sinclair,12-Sep-16,2,"So, I purchase music through Amazon. There were a few albums I bought and downloaded and they became available in my default music application on android, which was cool since this app isn't that great. But anything I purchased and downloaded after was only available to play in the Amazon app, which was disappointing because I purchased the music, let me play it in whatever app I please. This app runs like garbage and if you aren't online, listening to music you downloaded can still be a struggle."
Amazon,Worst App ever,just another brick in the wall,22-Oct-16,1,"I download a lot of apps and this one is one of the worst.  I downloaded it to my Windows PC and after installation I started it up.  Up came a screen and said it was uploading my music.  Don't I get a choice?  There was no cancel, no nothin to get it to stop.  I stopped it by using task manager.  The next time I ran it, there were some selections but none of them worked.  I rebooted my PC and tried again.  I got to navigate once and the app froze up.  Next step was to uninstall it."
Amazon,I gave it 4 stars only because,Evelyn Jackson,9-Jan-17,4,I only gave it 4 because there is not an option to close this app without signing all the way out of the app.  I hate to have to put in my email and then my password every time I open the app.  I like in the Iheart app you can close the app but you don't have to put in all your info when you open the app again so I listen to it more than the Amazon Music App.
Amazon,Wanted to love it.,Amazon Fan,9-Jun-15,1,"I wanted to like this app. I liked being able to download music to my phone that I got through amazon prime for free. I was also able to import my music from my SD Card into it and create playlists. Great. The app seemed to perform well, however it DRAINS BATTERY like no other in the background.  I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large % of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I don't need to force close, Amazon?  For the record I only ever listed to music that was local to my device. Never streamed music."
Amazon,Far better products out there,Rowan Jacobson,15-Jan-17,1,"Moving over from Deezer I have been very disappointed by Amazon Music. There is not a lot of choice of music-especially for those who prefer niche artists rather than main stream pop. Even though Amazon basically invented the recommendation algorithm, its music recommendations fall very short from what Deezer providers. I bought Amazon Prime specifically for deliveries of Amazon purchases and have given Amazon Music a chance. But Ive now resubscribed to Deezer."
Amazon,Duplicate Songs in Amazon Music Playlists,Colleen,26-Jun-17,3,"Its not bad. Good selection of music to pick from. However the biggest problem is duplicate songs. When you click to add a song to your playlist, it doesn't notify you if the song is already there, it just adds it therefore duplicates add up. Spotify would notify you that the song was already added to your playlist. They really need to look into fixing this issue, seems like a simple fix to just prompt you before adding."
Amazon,Best of the Best,Will W.,24-Aug-11,5,"I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says ""Free for a limited time ..."" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have a unlimited data plan)."
Amazon,This works!,LDWesty,6-Oct-16,5,"I like it, especially as an alternative to itunes.It took me a while but I finally migrated all my apple music over.Now I can listen to my cloud library or prime music in the car with very little data usage."
Amazon,Better than the many apps I have tried,B. L. Mainer,15-Jul-17,5,"Better than the many apps I have tried, but why do I need to pay an extra $10 a month to listen to music when I'm already paying for Prime?? Daylight robbery"
Amazon,Used this on fire tv and really enjoyed it until recent fire tv update,Jeremy Miller,12-Feb-17,1,Used this on fire tv and really enjoyed it until recent fire tv update. Now the app no longer works....will not even open. Was gonna upgrade to music unlimited but why bother if I cannot even access the app??? Have seen a lot of similar complaints but have found no answer......
Amazon,Not quite where I need it for my lifestyle,Reginald Bryant,10-Apr-15,3,"ok selection of music, but its not quite at the level of google play music yet. I know that its included with my prime membership, but the fact that im still paying for google music when i could be exclusively using this service is telling in my opinion."
Amazon,"Nice App, needs more capability",TStock,8-Aug-13,4,"I've had this app for a few months now.  I do enjoy using it to play music.  I never was too pleased with iTunes, this is a bit better IMHO.I have about 7,600 songs in my library.  I've downloaded about half to my phone.  When I try to shuffle that, it blows up the app and force-closes on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  It seems that it cannot handle the shuffle of that many songs.  This is a big bummer and my primary complaint with the app.The other thing that bugs me is that it seems to be missing the ability to add songs to playlists at various parts of the application.  For example - if you're playing a song, you can't add it to a playlist from that point."
Amazon,"Best value (as of 3/29/15) and now virtually UNLIMITED Secure, fast biderectional cloud storage via good usser interfaces.",RayDog95,29-Mar-15,5,"A solid Cloud service, great value - especially now that annual price for Unlimited storage is under $60!  The caution I have is that - with large music libraries, up and downloads take significant time - even on very high speed connections (I have Verizon FIOS 50MBS bidirectional and Gigabit WiFi).It is best to clean all your files and ensure correct MP3 tags are in place BEFORE you upload - otherwise, the service automatically modifies tags while upgrading the music file quality.  I found this especially true for audio books in MP3 format - in particular.This is an outstanding value and it makes your music available to any of your Windows, Android, iPad or similar devices.  thanks !!!"
Amazon,"Amazon,it needs work!!",Sue Gates,2-Nov-17,3,"I'm stunned you can't listen to small sample of songs!! Google does,and does it very well! Also layout is confusing,not clear cut. And shocked not to find very popular CDs not there!"
Amazon,"Good and Bad, Mostly Good",Phyllis Alexander,24-Aug-17,4,"I deducted one star for the following annoyance:Sound quality is inferior to ITunes.  I have many my favorite songs on both services, and I really notice a degradation in quality of certain songs,. especially Beatles mono tunes.Otherwise, how could you not love free music (with Prime subscription), and their classic rock playlists rule!"
Amazon,Very Happy with Amazon Music!,Mark Hilgenberg,14-Oct-16,5,"I have been using Amazon Music online and the PC app for sometime since I was able to upload all my MP3s I own. Lately I have been adding more Prime songs which has been great. I am also very happy with the new update to the Android App, it is great. The Android App sound quality is really good, especially with my Sony Bluetooth Headphones.  One of the best features is the ability to download Prime songs to your phone or SD Card, this has expanded my offline library by a ton."
Amazon,Five Stars,Deanna Marz,1-Jun-16,5,Great music options
Amazon,Confusing Stupid App,Jacob,9-May-17,2,This app is confusing and has terrible UX. I've been using it for a while and I still get lost and frustrated. Once again took time out my day to figure out how to do something on a music app. Here a piece of classic design advice. The KISS principle. Keep It Simple Stupid.
Amazon,Love using the app,MJ,17-Sep-17,5,Love using the app.  can download music on my phone to listen to on the go at anytime and can update the music when I want
Amazon,Almost 5 Star! More Clean Options Please,gllw,4-Mar-16,4,"I really enjoy the use of the app & service. M only reason for not rating 5 stars is that I have not seen much ""clean"" hip hop nor are there a lot of ""clean"" hip hop stations.I share a lot of 90's music with my kids (and they like it more than a lot of contemporary stuff) but I like to do so with radio/clean edits. Cursing isn't allowed in our home and although I'm sure they hear/see others doing it, we have that as a standard in the house.My music collection theory is:Variety - YES! Û¢ Foul Language - NO!"
Amazon,Won't work well without data on my cell,Amazon Customer,14-Jun-14,2,"I have been using this for the last couple months, it has been great until the update two days ago.  I have a smart phone without a data plan, so I have music saved to the memory on my phone; accessible when I am not in wifi range.  It worked wonderfully as my ""ipod"" until Prime Music launched.  My phone updated the app, and a massive amount of music was suddenly available for my listening pleasure.  Great in concept!  But, the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience.  Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago, it now takes MINUTES for a song to play.  I give up on it working, put it back in my pocket, and a few minutes later hear the song take off.  Skipping ahead?  Nope.  Pausing?  Yeah, that works well still.  Why does the new version affect songs that are stored to my device?  I don't understand it."
Amazon,I just want to download music simply and easily.,AP,12-Dec-16,1,"I find this app confusing. It doesn't seem to work correctly. It doesn't always open on my laptop. It's hard to find recently added music. I also think amazon has made it more difficult to easily add music to itunes. Often duplicate files download, and I can't seem to keep that from happening. I am not a novice digital music buyer or user. I've been buying my music from amazon for about 10 years. Every time they update a music app, it's buggy and bulky."
Amazon,Five Stars,de plume,8-Mar-17,5,Use it almost every night to go to sleep to.
Amazon,Nice service!,Don,22-Jan-17,5,"I just used this on a trip driving across a couple states. I was very happy to leave it on a ""channel"" all day and have great streaming music with no commercials."
Amazon,Not necessary,Truest1yet,13-Jun-17,1,This should be included for amazon customers. There are too many apps and websites that offer free music already.
Amazon,Dysfunctional,Robert Singleton,18-Jun-14,1,"I tried using this on my computer. I found it very difficult and dysfunctional. I created a play classical music list, which included Handel's Messiah. Unfortunately, each segment was listed in alphabetical order, mixed in with all the other items on my play list. I could not simply play the Messiah from start to finish. Many of the items on my play list were listed in alphabetical order by the first name of the composer. You have to add each item to your play list individually. Each movement of a symphony must be individually loaded. It takes forever. I'm going back to Pandora."

Amazon,Five Stars,DAS,12-May-17,5,Variety of music
Amazon,I want to like it... but,Steve-O,25-Apr-12,2,"I have to say the program on my Droid 2 is sluggish and locks up occasionally.  Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.  Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists.  There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I don't miss anything.  And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch (yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything.  It's a chore and takes a long time.)  Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres:  I'm a nut about tagging my music.  I will tag my music separating the tag with a "";"" for each tag.  Amazon doesn't recognize this and now I have 736 different Genres.  Useless.Pluses:  You can buy music on Amazon and it's there ready to stream on the app immediately.  If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything (and I mean a lot) in my music library."
Amazon,"No 7"" tablet interfce",arrowrand,14-Feb-12,1,"I'll continue to use only Google Music because if your 7"" Android tablet ISN'T a Kindle Fire, you don't get any tablet interface.This app looks awful on 7"" Honeycomb tablets."

Amazon,Still Amazon,trent,20-May-16,2,"Runs on my Nexus6 under the Android N beta3.Comes with my Prime subscription, so I thought why not try it out again. Now I remember why I didn't use it before, even though I bought some music from Amazon...it really is quite intrusive and resource intense.Also I was sad to see that Amazon apparently does not support Prime Music (as well as Prime Video) on my Nexus Player !Uninstalling. Amazon can keep the money I spent before on music. I am sticking with my Google Play Music subscription."

Amazon,... and this perk alone is enough (not 100% more like 92%) to keep me a Prime Member for this ...,ShoppingLove,3-Jul-17,5,I have been a Prime Member since 2012 and this perk alone is enough (not 100% more like 92%) to keep me a Prime Member for this next year as well.
Amazon,"its good value, along with the TV/Video/Shipping etc",Efstathi Placidas,6-Aug-14,3,"Ok. So far, for the value, as a student account getting this for $5 a month, its  good value, along with the TV/Video/Shipping etc...HOWEVER, I am thoroughly unimpressed with the overall quality of the music streamed from the cloud. There is NO EQ that I can find, and not control over bit quality for those wanting less or more quality. It shows duplicates in the lists. It showed Joe Satriani under Steve Vai's artist filter. There is a fair amount of choice. There is no way to share or auto post ""What I am listening to""  to FB, or Google+ or Twitter. There are no skins or way to get a smaller compact player. The one option is not much of an option and still too big, and lacking basic info. There is potential here, but as it stands I can get my music by other means once I am no longer in school."
Amazon,Five Stars,Happy PsychAmazon,22-Apr-17,5,good selection.nice for phone.
Amazon,Makes Prime worth the $!,Hope,12-May-16,5,I love this app! I use it all the time instead of Pandora. You can type in a song or artist and listen to exactly what you're in the mood for. You can even listen to an entire album of the specific artist you're in the mood for.
Amazon,A great app that I use every day,J. Chambers,1-Feb-13,5,"I cheered when Amazon started selling MP3 music a few years ago. It was time for Apple's iTunes to get some serious competition, and Amazon's MP3 store has done that. With the MP3 app being integrated with the Amazon Cloud, it's now easy to purchase or play my music from my Android phone and tablet."
Amazon,Great deal .,brian runnells,30-Apr-17,5,Very nice on my phone.
Amazon,Prime Music is swell.  This app is not.,Xavier,17-Jun-14,2,"The previous version of Amazon's music app worked just fine on my Galaxy S4.  I had about 7,000 mp3 tracks loaded and it navigated them just fine, and was even speedy on operations like updating playlists.  This new version is much, much slower, to the point of appearing to be frozen.  Add to that the clumsy navigation around the cloud, prime, and other online Amazon offerings, and it's just a total mess.  I've uninstalled this and gone back to the basic Samsung music player.  Try again Amazon."
Amazon,This is the most horrible music selection I've ever seen,leathasme,26-May-17,1,This is the most horrible music selection I've ever seen. I heart radio has y'all beat and there's just a station. Ridiculous for what I pay for my membership a year. Y'all need better selection of music for us to be able to download. None of the new releases nope can't do that got to buy something from y'all ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous.
Amazon,HATE THE NEW UPDATE,Captain Duck,13-Oct-16,1,HATE THE NEW UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!IT WONT LET ME ADD ANY SONGS TO THE PLAYLISTS OR CHECK LYRICS. CAN SOMEBODY HELP IF THERE IS A SOLUTION!

Amazon,If only...,David R.,14-Oct-13,1,It worked out of the US and Canada like itunes.  I don't understand why it doesn't.  With itunes I was able to buy music in the Costa Rica store with no problem at all.  Not sure why you guys don't go international.  If it has to do with piracy then you should know that anyone who wants to illegally download content can do it with ease and by not enabling your store on the international stage you are only hurting yourselves.  If you considered making purchases available in other countries you would be making alot more money in those markets than you are now (nothing).  Guess I'll stick to buying from Itunes.
Amazon,alexa alwayssays theres no music in my library. How ...,Larry Myre,5-May-17,1,alexa alwayssays theres no music in my library.  How do I put music in if it won't give me any music choices?
Amazon,Unbelievably it can't download to SD card on droid,Kenneth Detweiler,5-Jun-13,1,I liked this app until I discovered that it cannot be set to store downloaded mp3's to the SD card. This essentially renders the application useless for its advertised purpose. Unfortunately I already subscribed for a year of the premium service. Lesson learned. I hope this review will spare you from making the same mistake.
Amazon,Forces Portrait,KJake,16-Jun-14,3,"I love the new Prime Music and having expanded access to A LOT more music! Makes Prime that much more worth it. This app is great on a phone, however it forces Portrait on a tab. This is fine if you have a 7-8 inch tab, but with a 10 inch tab, it is kinda annoying. We need a Landscape view for us tablet users, please."
Amazon,Horribly Updated Music App.,yafi,2-Apr-15,1,"I absolutely refuse to renew my Prime after many awful experiences with the new updates Amazon came up with when they launched Prime music.

Shouldn't ""updates"" make things better? In my opinion, Amazon has gone from convenience to aggravation. S*** rolls down hill. No Prime, less shopping. I have Netflix so I don't need instant video. Less and less mp3 sales. Amazon, do you get the picture?"
Amazon,Awesome music app,Desiree K.,28-Apr-16,5,This is an awesome app. I use it all the time when I am at the gym and love the different music that is available to download.
Amazon,Don't double charge !,Gary Weaver,16-Jul-17,1,"I wanted to upgrade to prime ultimate,but did not realize that it would cost as much as other disappointing streaming services. Amazon! Don't let us down ... give your dedicated customers the streaming that we have already paid for. G W"
Amazon,Stop Outsourcing and Fix My App,Public Relations Student,17-May-16,3,"I truly enjoy my Amazon Prime music subscription. Being a college student, it's super cheap and easy. I have always loved the app...until now. Now whenever I download music or I am streaming it I cannot let my phone screen turn off. If my screen turns off it stops streaming and downloading. I thought that it might be my internet, but it does that with every WiFi system I have been on and my data.I have contacted Amazon but they were no help. Seemed like Amazon outsources their app tech support."
Amazon,So far it's got nothing on Spotify,Danielle,7-Nov-16,2,Super hard to use. Confusing setup. Worst of all it takes forever to individually select songs to move to playlists once downloaded. Song selection still lacking.

Amazon,Amazon Music Prime = GREAT! but one BIG issue.,Mario Fialho,17-Jun-14,2,"My wife and I have one Prime Membership.  We do not need two. We love this new Prime Music addition.  AWESOME!  However, both of us cannot listen to our Prime Music at the same time. This setting is counter intuitive!!!  This throttling should be set to ""two devices"" at an absolute minimum to support the typical family.  We have four kids and do things separately all the time.  We don't want to clog up our phones by downloading the songs every time we want to listen to them, so we the use of the CLOUD.  We also use Amazon for all of our Movie storage, via Rokus.  The whole idea of having an App and the cloud is to PREVENT this downloading business.  We have been BIG fans of Amazon over ITunes, ever since they crashed LALA into the ground and will remain Amazon faithful, please make this happen!"

Amazon,"Good service, app needs improvement.",Amazon Customer,16-Oct-16,3,"The subscription service might get me to switch from Google Play Music, but this app needs work. It's a bit of a hassle to navigate, but my biggest gripe is when I go to ""my music"" and click on an artist I'm taken to a list of every song by the artist in a big stupid list. Example: Click on ""The Beatles"" and I'm staring at the top of a huge list of songs. This is a pain. Also wish I could store more of my music on the Amazon Cloud."
Amazon,"Very Good, But Room For Improvement",christopher reis,4-Oct-12,4,"I'm a big fan of this app, but it still has some shortcomings that just drive me up the walls:1. Sorting. ""The Beatles"" should not be sorted under the letter ""T."" The sorting works fine in the iOS version, but for some reason, on Android, it's a mess.2. When opening the app, it should default to ""Artists"" not albums. It's logical for people to think, ""oh, I feel like listening to [artist]"" rather than thinking of an album first. It's one extra click, but it's a fairly obvious thing. And this is something that only recently changed, it used to work just fine.3. Random songs on my cloud drive just won't appear on the mobile app. Haven't figured out what causes this to happen. Sometimes deleting and re-uploading the track works, other times the missing song might just randomly reappear. Whatever causes this needs to be resolved.4. User's should be allowed to shut off ""Upgraded Audio."" Great, so I rip my MP3's at 256 to 320kbps (VBR) using the LAME MP3 encoder, and Amazon tells me that they're ""upgrading"" my audio to 256kpbs? Last I checked, 256kbps was of a lower quality than 320kpbs.5. Could use an editable EQ. Currently it has presets you can cycle through, but I'd like the ability to edit the EQ settings myself."
Amazon,Very dissatisfied,Quackeliminator,23-Feb-15,2,"I jumped in with both feet with this app and decided I was going to love it..Prime music, the cloud storage....I really tried to give it my all.  Calling it a resource hog is polite. My Galaxy S4 with 16GB of internal and 32GB of external was no match. If you have any kind of a music library say goodbye to your internal memory.  I love the prime music but it is worthless when you can't use it. Amazon does so many things well...whoever approved this app can't be much of a music lover.....or they are a former iTunes programmer. I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it would almost be easier to rip music and use media player.  Very frustratied and disappointed."
Amazon,5 stars for Amazon Prime Music!,Michael Kushner,4-Sep-17,5,"I am truly enjoying Prime Music. The variety of available artists, albums, genres and songs is very entertaining for me. And, a great break from my huge jukebox of digital music. I would recommend this Amazon streaming service to anybody I know. I have done just that, with great response."
Amazon,When it works its Brilliant..... But it mostly doesnt work,Ms. C. M. Hough,24-Apr-16,1,When it works its fab.Mostly it doesnt work.  I have had problems waiting 4 days for a downloads to appear.  and today all my playlists are messed up or missing.  my cloud playlists are empty.  Its all so so annoying because it takes forever to set up the playlists in the first place.  This will be the 5th or 6th time i have had to re-do my playlists on amazon music.The whole package is full of bugs.  and now its time to scrap it and find something else that just works everytime.
Amazon,Complete Garbage,Stone,9-Mar-16,1,"This is a garbage application.  Very slow and unresponsive.  When I upload music, it takes forever to update in the app and most of the time I end up closing and reopening it.  Can't say I like it very much at all."
Amazon,Terrible service don't waste your money.,Tye Hardison,26-Feb-17,1,"Sucks on my Android phone, even at home on a fast wifi connection it is constantly stopping to spool download music.  Useless on the road with a good 4G connection, it will never finish a song without stopping.  Don't pay for the $7.99 subscription as the library of music has shrunk.  The desktop app is just as bad with a limited selection of mostly very old stuff and albums that never made the top 25 of the music charts."
Amazon,While it's good to hear music on my phone,Sandra Silva,16-Mar-17,2,"While it's good to hear music on my phone,  I can't take my phone onto the production floor at work. I can take an mp3 player or a shuffle. However, what good is having all these songs if I can't transfer them to either device. It's not worth the membership price if you can't load them to the computer or mp3 player. I might as well cancel or demand a refund for products that I purchased but cannot use."
Amazon,This ia the good music App,Damaris H.,8-May-17,5,Awesome App. Great music from every genre. Don't know how I went without this wonderful application on my phone! Get it now.
Amazon,(Temporarily?) Ruined by a recent update,ALK,14-Oct-16,1,"A recent update turned this app into a constantly crashing disaster on PC.  What's worse is that Amazon is not really communicating about the issue as of the time I posted this review.  I would avoid using this app at all costs until the problem is solved.It's a shame, given that I would have previously rated this app as a four-star app: I was genuinely happy with it before.  Of course, that was back when it was still functioning."
Amazon,Does this app run on anything?,Kyle Moyer,14-Sep-14,1,"If only I had the option to rate with a zero, or even a negative value... I have three tablets and two phones linked to my Amazon account, and this app is incompatible with all of them (one is even a kindle!) Seriously!? Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can't even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I'm usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but... AMAZON FIX YOUR APP, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!Though, from the sounds of all the other reviews, I'm better off not having it on my devices to begin with. Guess I dodged a bullet? Seriously reconsidering my prime subscription now."
Amazon,The new app sucks. It is buggy and slow,Danaly,10-Nov-16,1,The new app sucks. It is buggy and slow. It is so interactive to the point of being annoying. Not very easy to use.
Amazon,Too little selection when compared  with other options out there.,John_J.,7-Apr-16,2,"Very limited music selection, even though it is included with Prime, I still find myself willing to pay for another music service."
Amazon,Like being back in the 90's,Stunned at the Stupid,21-May-15,1,"Amazon is a great company. Except for this monstrosity. I think that it really is the worst piece of software I have used in the last 10 years. Vile. Makes me want to find the name of the people who coded it and do bad things. Sorry to shout people- AMAZON, JUST LET US DOWNLOAD OUR MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT YOUR STUPID ADVERTISING. IT'S NOT WORKING. Whew! I'm using iTunes more when I remember just how terrible this thing is. Go ahead, try it. You will see."
Amazon,Violates Our Privacy,Robert Delahunt,27-Apr-15,1,"It worked great for a long time.  It would constantly run, but you could close it.  I loved everything about it ... until an update changed its behavior.  Now it was reading the SIM card on my phone for no reason.  This is a horrible violation of privacy, so I uninstalled it.  I still use Amazon Music for MP3 because there's nothing better, but for now I'll just manually copy the MP3s to my phone and use Google Play Music app to play the songs while I am jogging.Dear Amazon: until you change the behavior of this application back to where it's not violating our privacy, I am not using your app.  Fix that, and I'll reinstall it."
Amazon,great additional benefit to prime membership,Amazon Customer,7-Aug-14,4,"As a free added benefit to prime membership, I have absolutely no complaints. Missing quite a few artists as I expected, but not too bad. There is currently no landscape mode, as far as I can tell. And being able to create your own playlist is a missing feature that I must have. But, as a benefit that I did not expect from Amazon, I have no complaints.  If I didn't have Prime, I would probably skip this."
Amazon,wow........no still wow just a sadder one,Lorie Meyers,23-Sep-14,1,This was the most exciting part of my sub. To amazon primeAKA my last review. I think I finally got spotify to stop charging me well u know I thought i didnt need it. Now to find out my $100 yearly payment was not enough. Amazon Im starting to worry about our relationship
Amazon,and that seems iffy at best. Also,Jay Christianson,11-Oct-17,1,"I have been trying out this service, and things had been going well.  Downloaded a ton of stuff locally to my phone.  Things played well at home, etc.But... plugged the thing into Android Auto.  Maybe one or two of my playlists will appear in the ""Recent Playlists"" section.. and that seems iffy at best.Also, even when the lists appear... it seems that AM is pulling the music from online, not the downloaded music I have.  This is annoying as hell as i get skips, etc that there should be no reason for.The recommended stuff lists are of no use to me... but there is no way to kill it.I think once my free preview of the service is done... i'm letting it go."
Amazon,Interesting choices of music.,jepp,15-Jun-17,4,"I don't use Amazon music all the time, but I do like the variety of music that I have not encountered on Pandora."
Amazon,Don't have a thing if it ain't got that swing,ken,20-Jun-14,2,"App is splashy, but had to be authorized from a computer, which is silly.  Signing up on your computer was just a method for driving hits to the site for popularity.  Problem was that it was not intuitive in navigation and therefore irksome.  The app looks fine, feels fine, but overall is veneer over cheap wood.  It's a bit clunky and goes for jukebox vintagey feel over function.  The app got locked up on trying to upload my music from my ipad.  No option to bypass, only sit there and wait.  Felt like a Microsoft product at Walmart.  I've purchased music and films at Amazon, but no cross-refencing to create suggestions or no ability for you to read a spotify playlist or even take a suggestion from the getgo.  This is clearly a rush job by an asynchronous team who had to take a shelved product to market after it finally passed through legal or something that held it up.So its available, but not fun to use.  Perhaps it will be fixed, but for now, luckily, there are other apps that sing and play.  This one will have to stay in from recess."
Amazon,The worst app I've never used.,Ben Rowan,24-Oct-15,1,"I don't use Amazon Music. I never have and have no intention to. But to use the weather app I downloaded from the Amazon App Store, I must be logged into the Amazon App Store. Which means I'm also logged into Amazon Music. So not only am I running 3 apps for no good reason, but Amazon Music constantly crashes. And I do mean constantly. Every 5 minutes or so what I'm doing on my phone is interrupted so that I can be notified that Amazon Music, the app I never downloaded or opened or used, has crashed. It happened twice while typing this.Amazon, you suck."
Amazon,"It sucks, i can't even figure out how to use ...",bob  lou,21-Jan-17,1,"It sucks, i can't even figure out how to use it. Every time you click on something a pop-up for unlimited comes up. The playlist suck at least for the artist I was looking for. After reading the other reviews I'm glad I didn't get to far with it. I don't want having control of my phone or anything else.There are plenty of other places to get my music without the aggravation this app puts you through. No thanks!"
Amazon,Less German songs please,Christoph KÌ¦pernick,23-Feb-17,3,"At least when using Music in Germany, almost one third of the songs from the playlists are in German. Even in obviously international playlists. Neither foreigners nor Germans usually like German music, but a fraction of people. I'm about to switch back to Spotify due to this. Please clear your playlists and provide some German-only playlists instead for the special interest folks. I'm German by the way ;) Thank you"
Amazon,a great addition to android.,Ben A,20-Apr-11,4,I'm running amazon mp3 on a nexus S. this app is great. cloud player works very well and sounds excellent. only issue I've had is with some buffering which seems to take forever but mobile reception is always a bit of a gamble. if I'm in a 3g area with full bars Cloud Player just works.I wish I could upload directly from my phone but that's my only gripe with the app. all the people complaining about how it doesn't work with their phone need to really assess the criteria that they buy phones with. get stock Android whenever possible.
Amazon,looks good at first,ME,26-Aug-16,1,"looks good at first, but after you spend lots of hours building play lists and downloading ""off line songs"", they start disappearing.  Play lists get messed up and disappear.  They seem to be baiting and switching.  Songs don't stay authorized for Off line or Prime.  Having to spend hours every week rebuilding play lists and downloading and getting somewhere off line and having no music is a real pain.  I will not be signing up for prime again."
Amazon,Can not store on external SD card and stream is bad for low BW.,Edward Diaz,15-May-13,1,"I love this player until I learned that I could not store offline music on my external sdcard. The streaming is also horrible for low bandwidth, while Pandora still streams well.I have a MetroPCS 4G plan with a 250Mb/month limit. When I am below my limit streaming is good however, when Metro starts to throttle my band width because I have exceeded my limit, streaming is intermittent(not usable). However, during these ""low band width"" condition, Pandora still streams extremely well, seems that Amazon could fix this!As a work around I decided to store locally, however I noticed that YOU CANT store on your external sdcard. At this point I have stopped purchasing from Amazon MP3. I would love it, if they could fix the external storage problem. Since you are forced to store on your phone's internal flash memory, you quickly start having issues with system performance (ie no space for mail..and so forth).Great product if you have unlimited 4G. Hopefully Amazon can fix these issues."
Amazon,"This sux, the older version allowed you to used ...",FrictionBurn,25-May-15,1,"This sux, the older version allowed you to used the app w/out having to stay logged in to listen to the music located on your device. Now you can't even use the app unless you have an amazon account and internet connection. The old version worked perfectly, was reliable and did everything I needed it to do. Sadly, now that you've changed it I will be looking for a different player."
Amazon,data usage was bad,Anonymous,20-May-13,1,"I only used it to download 6 songs and 1 album. Then I played two tracks and the data usage was over 500 MB. The other app Google(?) registered very little. I guess this app would be okay when used at home or at a public wifi but I'm usually on the road. I'm an avid fan of Amazon (4 kindle purchases, Amazon Prime and the bulk of my online purchases come via Amazon) but  of this app? Not so much."
Amazon,Great music for all your moods!!!,Theresa,21-Jul-17,5,This app is so easy to use. It has great music!!! You can put your own playlist together or they already have fabulous playlists ready to go. Any music lover will LOVE this app!!!
Amazon,Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music,Amazon Customer,17-Jun-15,1,I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update.  Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their  device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted.
Amazon,Change your format!!!,sheba,9-Jan-17,1,Do not like the format...I lose music also!!!
Amazon,Easy-Peasy!,Harry Arianas,12-Jun-17,5,"What a great app; free music and streamlined, easy-to-use menus are quick to navigate, and get you what you need."
Amazon,"Was great, what happened?",Jim from RC,10-Jan-17,2,"Getting tired of this going into sample mode for no apparent reason! Everything is fine and then it just mysteriously starts playing a song for 15 seconds and then on to the next. Really annoying and close to dumping this ""service""."
Amazon,ease of use,signalH,7-May-17,5,Easy to use. My tunes are organized based on my interest. I continue to add songs to my different categories.
Amazon,I bought an HTC Android device for this reason,Amazon Customer,5-Sep-11,5,"I thought it was neat when it came out.  But I only had a ""stupid phone"" not a ""smart phone"".  I wasn't eligible to get a ""smart phone"" until Oct 2010.  It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive.  Just go get on amazon...sweet!  However, I wanted one of those smart phones.  I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed.  However, waiting gets the best of us.  I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet.  I thought the 7"" display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you.  And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT.  It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I didn't.  This way I get what I wanted (android stuff) and I didn't have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I'm in the middle of dishes and I can't get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it's available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier.  I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems.  No searching this folder or that.  I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I didn't like was that for some reason I can't figure out how to not download a whole album...but that doesn't take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player :)If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak ;)"
Amazon,Doesn't work anymore,P. Anderson,30-Jun-14,1,"If I had submitted a review immediately after I installed the app, I would have given it a pretty high rating. It did exactly what I wanted and did it well. The most recent update, however, seems to have borked things. The app stopped working about 7-10 days ago and is completely useless now. I've cleared the cache, uninstalled and then re-installed the app, and done everything else I could think of and nothing has helped. It stays at the log in screen. I input my email and password and it either crashes or tells me I've input the wrong info. I know the info is correct because the PC and ios versions of the app work fine, it is just the android version that seems to be broken. Hopefully a future update fixes this problem because I want to use this app."
Amazon,Music Everywhere!,Dee N,3-Nov-15,5,Convenient way to access both my Amazon music as well as my own MP3 library that I uploaded to Amazon Cloud. I now keep a few GB of music on my phone and stream what I don't listen to often. It's also convenient to transport music between my Kindle and phone.
Amazon,Disappointment.  Tracks no longer available in Prime.,Zvi Weiss,20-Aug-14,1,"Disappointment.  I was excited when Prime Music was announced and spent time collecting some favorite tracks.  Now, onle a few weeks later a large majority of those tracks are no longer available with Prime Music.  How frustrating, disappointing, and unprofessional of Amazon.  Actually, rather un-Amazon like.  If there are issues of royalty, those should have been settled before any track was released or made available to Prime customers.  What am I supposed to do now?  Spend more hours to clean up my Library and Playlists?I am usually happy with Amazon and their service, but this time I must say I am VERY (CAPITAL LETTERS) DISAPPOINTED.  Hopefully someone in Amazon reads my feedback and will take some action."
Amazon,Free music - Great Selection,Frank Graves,5-Jan-17,4,I really enjoy using Amazon music and it offers free music that I would otherwise have to pay for. Great to be a Prime member. Application is a bit confusing but not too hard to get used to.
Amazon,"Lack of major feature, and a very annoying bug, but functional.",Eric,8-Aug-14,3,"Been using this since Amazon Cloud Player, and the new updates are less than thrilling.As another reviewer pointed out, you can't make and save playlists to cloud. I run amazon music on my laptop and phone, and playlists have to be made separately for each device.More annoying still is that imported mp3s to my phone are being made into weird albums. Any album with more than one artist contributing (soundtracks for instance) are separated into as many ""albums"" as there are artists in said album. This is ridiculous. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be any manual way to fix it.Aside from these two major irritations, the app functions as advertised. Otherwise I would rate it lower."
Amazon,"Love, love, love this!!",Jan Thompson,23-Jun-14,5,"I've enjoyed Amazon Prime benefits for years and when Prime Music was added, I was thrilled! I was very impressed with the different types of music offered. My phone and tablet are full now. To me, just the music is worth joining Prime! You'll find music for everyone in your family!"
Amazon,Can't cast using Chromecast?,J. E. Rivera,27-May-17,2,"Forget you, Amazon. Forget you. Until you allow to cast using Chromecast, maybe then."
Amazon,Screwed,Jerod Gummer,18-Mar-15,1,"So today I bought an album that I already owned while listening to it. Then contacting support who simply said that you can't return digital music. I told them I already have the album, along with 20,000 other songs. So on each one I can pick up my phone and accidentally buy it if I'm not careful. Also, no way to turn off one-click ordering? So I'm deleting and moving my music. I seriously spend so much money on Amazon, being blatantly screwed really makes me want to take ALL of my business elsewhere. It is almost like I'm sad that they can't just be better and have common sense. Can't they add a ""ARE YOU SURE"" button..."
Amazon,Support for SD Cards please,Kyle,22-Nov-13,3,"if I could save music downloaded from the amazon cloud onto my 64 gb SD card this would be a five star review.  I don't even care about moving the app itself to the SD card.  I just need space for tunes.  I only have 8gb on my Droid Razr M.  I got over 30gb of music i'd like to take with me.  SD functionality please?!?!If I constantly had access to wifi or 4g internet I""d be totally fine with you using the cloud all the time..."
Amazon,Frustrating - Interface is needlessly confusing and difficult,M. Stoneman,8-Dec-16,2,"This app is very challenging to use.  First, while it's intuitive to search, once you have music picked you want to listen to, it is difficult to find it once again.  Amazon programmers, I'd invite you to take a look at the Spotify interface. Right now on Amazon music, I can neither find playlists or albums I have listened to previously. I have largely given up because it is so complicated to navigate."
Amazon,Was a decent app.,D. J. Swanson,4-Jun-16,1,"All of a sudden I can only play 500 songs on shuffle. I have 4100+ songs that I normally shuffle.I listen to my music in my vehicle and at work.It was shuffling fine on my old phone, but the new phone running Android Marshmallow  seems to have a different version of the app."
Amazon,Excellent Prime Membership feature!,tgilmer2,27-Dec-15,5,I love being to create my own music lists as well as listening to already programmed ones. I listen to this everyday with my phone on my commute from the East-East Bay to San Francisco on BART (55min if no delays). I have Verizon and only lose connectivity occasionally through the trans-bay tube and Caldecott tunnel.  Nice feature of Prime Membership!
Amazon,Ruined my faith and enjoyment with Amazon Music.,William Gowers,17-Oct-16,1,Crappy app.  Slows system down.  Runs all the time.  Unable to upload MP3 files to my Amazon cloud library.  Wish I could get the previous version back.  Terrible!  Been on the phone twice with Amazon tech and they were unable to resolve the problems.
Amazon,Unable to save music to SD Card,Joshua Abell,12-Sep-12,2,"The inability of this app to save downloaded music to my external SD card earns it a two star deduction. That's kinda the whole point of me getting an SD card. I have awful signal at work, so I can't use streaming, and the SD card issue really limits the amount of music I can download to my device. I really like most of the rest of the app, but that simple limitation makes it really hard to love the app in total."
Amazon,Can NOT dowload the music I bought onto my external SD card!,TweakRacer,9-Aug-12,1,"I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 on Verizon. The app can ONLY download to the phone's memory (same with my Motorola Droid X), and NOT my external micro SDHC card (where I, like many, store MUSIC/pictures/videos). The music tracks are like 7MB each. And don't blab to me about the Cloud Drive. While that sounds great in theory, with only Sprint keeping unlimited data plans available (I just lost mine in this last phone upgrade), streaming music all the time is not gonna cut it. I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card (using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP). Ugghhhh...... Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
Amazon,I love the download side of this,Amazon Customer,8-Mar-16,3,I love the download side of this. Great selection of music and I really like being able to download pre made playlists.My issue is that the app itself does not play well with other apps. If you have this playing with navigation running it will not mute or reduce the volume like other music apps do. Also external controls for skipping to the next track or pausing the music do not work. This app can only function as a stand alone and is useless if anything else is running.
Amazon,The worst thing you could have possibly done to amazon music,Oscar Honeycutt,15-Oct-16,1,"The worst thing you could have possibly done to amazon music.  This is beyond a doubt the most complex and difficult to use update amazon has ever come up with. Whoever thought this up should be fired! Difficult to navigate, complex beyond words, this new version makes moving music between programs nearly impossible. I truly hate what you've done. I will no longer purchase my music from amazon. Truly deplorable"
Amazon,"Music, music, everywhere!",K. Ethier,2-Feb-15,5,"I am really thrilled with Amazon Music. I started with the app for PC so I could enjoy my Amazon Prime Music benefits on my computer, but then added Amazon Music to my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire. I am really sold on this, and here's why:Being a Prime member, I can add a wide variety of music to my cloud storage for free, which is exactly what I did. Hundreds of songs - FREE! Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I've purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I've purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I've not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I'm not sure it's possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use. To be honest, I thought it was really straightforward and easy to use. One complaint that I saw says you can't use your newly-purchased music unless you download everything again... I bought some new music yesterday and I downloaded just the new music. It was very simple to figure out and download. Perhaps the complainers had an older version of the app?If you are a Prime member and love music, I think you'll like this app. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
Amazon,Love prime music,Ekgeis,8-Sep-15,5,"Love prime music, have it on every device and it works wonderfully. Ironically, I can't get on in my kindle, so I'll probably buy a regular android tablet next so I can actually use this app on my tablet instead of having to use phone or computer."
Amazon,Not logging in,picataggio,25-Feb-13,1,"For a few months I have not been able to make purchases with this app because it asks me to login but does not seem to recogonize my Username and PW.I am able to login into the cloud drive with no problem at all. Play music off the cloud drive, purchase and what not. But not from the APP!!!I am at a complete loss as to what is going on.I have tried COPY / PASTE, Manual typing and it always comes back with "" Wrong USERNAME or PASSWORD "".( Again, I can login from the WEB with no issues at all )"
Amazon,STILL no option where to store songs.,Choda Boy,4-Nov-12,1,"It is unfortunate you cannot give zero stars.  There is NO REASON that this app should not allow the user to select where the songs and associated data are stored.  NO REASON. I have a 64GB SD card and cannot store any of my Amazon Music on it (unless I use root to mount the SD card folder on the internal storage.) KitKat allows an app to use an SD card, just not read folders created by other apps. Amazon, please allow your paying customers to select where they want to store THEIR music.Although it is nice to have the ability to download Prime Music, the decision to store the encrypted music in the Amazon Music app data directory (Android/data/com.amazon.mp3) not only means that it will be stored in internal storage, but will also get backed up by apps like Titanium Backup. If you keep a history of multiple backup files, you end up with multiple copies of the same Amazon Prime Music you have downloaded. Since the music is encrypted, why not allow the user to select where it is stored?Worst of all, if you need to reinstall the Amazon Music app, all of the encrypted Prime Music you have downloaded will no longer play and must be deleted and re-downloaded. I do not know how the Prime Music encryption key is created, but it would be appreciated if there was a way to re-authenticate Prime Music already downloaded."
Amazon,Not ver functional,TC,30-Sep-12,2,"The app plays music fine and is easy to purchase music with, but it is not very good other than that.Be warned that you cannot set the app to download music to an SD card, you have to use the internal memory. Also, you cannot create a playlist on your device and sync it to the cloud."
Amazon,Lots of selections of music,Esteban,8-May-17,3,"A good variety of music for use on smart phones, tablets and desk top or lap top computers. However, it is difficult to use."
Amazon,"I keep coming back and trying Amazon Music, but ...",daimas,23-Aug-15,2,"I keep coming back and trying Amazon Music, but it always seems to stutter when playing.  Nothing else I use does this.  At some point I'll quit trying."
Amazon,No ability to save on external storage,Kent,31-Oct-12,2,"App itself is ok, but there is no ability to save MP3s on external storage.  I would be fine with the concept of saving internally and then copying to external, but if you do that, you lose the playlist you downloaded to your phone.  There is no 'playlist' file that can be transferred or updated to find the newly relocated music.  Now you just have a playlist on your phone that has '0' songs in it.Storage location is a must for this type of app."
Amazon,"Great app, but doesn't support Chromecast Audio",Gwen,29-Jan-16,3,"This was my go-to music app - it's got a great interface, and I like how easy it is to find, purchase, and seamlessly integrate new music into my library.  However, I recently added Chromecast Audio throughout my house, and Amazon for some reason refuses to support it.  When I use the Amazon app, I'm stuck using a single stereo in my house, and that's not good enough for me.  So, Amazon, get over yourself and play in the sandbox with Google on this, and I'll reconsider my switch to Spotify."
Amazon,saved all my music in the Cloud,Myron E. Cross II,21-Jul-13,5,"My last phone was dying, so my wife got me a new HTC ONE. I thought I lost all my music like my photos, but as I'm learning how to use this wonderful little computer/phone I found all my music in the cloud. Thank you Amazon MP3 geeks for being light-years ahead of me. I have 2 sons in their late 20's and early 30's whom are computer wizards but live 750 miles away, so I'm on my own. Amazon geeks rock!"
Amazon,Why pay if your prime?,Jessica Kovalski,18-Jul-17,1,"Ugh!! I already pay $99 a year for prime, videos are included I thought music was too?! It used to be?! What's up?! Now to play music on Alexa we have to tell it each song and sooo slow not user friendly at all. I hope Amazon takes note of all these reviews and makes the music app free and does something with it, like the video one, just ridiculous."

Amazon,Constantly hangs,Bret Goldfarb,17-Jun-16,1,This app constantly hangs every few minutes.  I'm not sure if it is when the library is refreshing or not but I'm uninstalling it.  I really wanted to like this app because I am a long time prime member.
Amazon,Flat and Terrible.,Kindle Customer,29-Apr-12,1,"This is mainly about one issue with this App. No Equalizer. It functions OK as long as I'm on WiFi or 4G, but it sounds terrible. I either use a stereo Bluetooth headset or my Turtle Beach corded set. Both sound great when connected to my PC where there are several ways of adjusting the sound, but sound terrible when used with this App alone. I picked up Equalizer from the Google Play Store and now I love my music again, but wait - I use my Kindle Fire alot. For those of you who don't know you can't get regular Android Apps on your Fire - only Amazon App Store Apps where there are a total of five if you do a search for ""equalizer"". So now I can listen to music on my phone or small HTC Tablet, but the Fire is out. Someone please upgrade this App or write a better one for the Amazon Market."

Amazon,"Would be great, but for non-configurable storage location",J. Brinkmann,12-Dec-12,1,"Only one star as there's currently no way to configure where the app stores downloaded music. On my Samsung Galaxy S3 it ends up on the internal sdcard, taking up valuable storage space required for apps. So after downloading the music using the app, I have to manually copy the files to my external 64GB sdcard. Talk about usability... To me this makes the whole player as such a waste of time.What point is an integrated player/downloader if an additional manual step is required every time I want to store the music locally? The cloud feature is great when listening on the desktop but with the phone I often listen to music when there's no stable or only a very slow internet connection (e.g. when on a plane or long-distance train).So only one instead of 4 or 5 stars, as the software as such is not usable right now. Just download the files via the desktop, copy them over to the phone's external sdcard and use the built-in mp3 player. Much better user experience and less hassle!"
Amazon,"Before You Scream, Click on AmazonCloudplayer Logo!",Lightworker USA,15-Apr-11,4,"I have a new Droid X, & I have been kind of cranky because, one, I'm not that familiar with the phone, & two, trying to figure out this app was just making me nuts. After 3 or 4 days, I was much more familiar with the phone. I discovered, by accident, that some things opened under my finger that I didn't think were ""touch"" spots. Who knew?Once I figured that out, I started touching more of the icons and words in the Amazon MP3 Cloudplayer window, which opened things I didn't expect  to open. There's no *PING* light bulb over my head, by any means. But it was a valuable experience.I can't say that it's terribly intuitive; it's not. It just takes messing around with this app to get more familiar with it - the more you use it, the more things you discover.In fact, right now I am listening to a song by Billy Joel. But when I was trying to show my daughter how this player system works, it wouldn't do exactly what I wanted, the way I thought it would. Poo.After years of iTunes, it's just going to be a matter of learning a new system. I just hope Cloudplayer is more reliable about maintaining the catalogue of songs I've purchased through this app - so I can download them again in case of catastrophe. iTunes really completely failed to do that, despite their reassurances all your purchased music could be retrieved. I just hope Amazon's Cloudplayer system actually works in that respect. Hopefully I'll never have to find out.Now, I'm going to figure out how to get music from my MacBook Pro's iTunes to migrate to my Droid X, and into Cloudplayer. (If you hear screaming, it's just me, but I'll tap something that looks suspicious, & maybe that will do the trick. At least that's my evil plan...)"

Amazon,My choice from the three contenders,lascenescom,30-Dec-12,4,"Choosing the right ""cloud"" solution for my music collection was a journey of trial and error. The complication arose out of my cross platform use.  I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go.  If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store.  I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device.  The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.  I highly recommend Amazon's Solution."

Amazon,Amazon Music TOTALLY trash,Malcolm Granger,13-Apr-15,1,"Totally sucks! This is Amazon? Yuck - to start with the negatives:1. It is not clear that Amazon Music is different from Amazon Prime.2. Amazon Music competes with Google Play with the HIUGE exception that Google Play is FREE while AM is $25 per year ON TOP OF the Amazon Prime rates, like $120 per year. Why would you ever buy Amazon when Google Play is FREE for a max of 50,000 songs?3. Oh boy, hold on here - after days of downloading my 21,000 songs into Amazon Music and using the AM app for my IOS iPhone 6plus, THE APP DOES NOT DOWNLOAD THE ACTUAL PLAYLISTS! I have now 21,000 songs in the cloud with NO playlists. Hello?4. You CANNOT get a refund for this stupid service. Grrrr"
Amazon,Only 1 membership & some updates makes it great.,Debbie Barger,20-Apr-15,4,"I have a love hate relationship with this app, music store.Being a Prime Member makes it Fantastic!Then some updates make it ok.**Amazon won't fix a mistake that has me now having & paying for 2 prime memberships!!! That's just wrong & bad business! But I'll lose music if I try to merge the 2 accounts into 1 account. If the 2nd prime account had not been mistakenly allowed to happen  (yep - no warning!!!), I'd say this is a win-win & great. But instead I have to switch from account to account to access various music! That's what ""Customer Service"" told me to do because there was no solution. With Today's Technology - I don't think so, unless a software was made & not fixed.....I love being an Amazon Prime Member, but not having 2 accounts & loosing prime & possibly bought music too if I merge my accounts.Trust me I tell folks that it's better to be an Amazon Prime Member than to belong to Costco & such for countless reasons. This isn't 1 of those reasons.So get this app, but make it attached to an already existing account or build your account through this.The Subscribe And Save is Wonderful!!! Then there's prime prices & prime movies, videos, music & more. I highly recommend this, but with caution."
Amazon,Eh. It has promise.,Tex S.,23-Sep-11,3,"Love the idea. I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is ""cool"", but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:1) Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I'm playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity isn't an issue.2) Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I've seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very ""tinny"" sounding. It's not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.3) Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. ""Random"" should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.4) Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere."

Amazon,Almost there...,MinnesotaKid,4-Apr-11,4,"I've got a couple days under my belt with the cloud / player and my initial impression is favorable. It's not perfect but the basic functionality is there and the delivery of music to my phone so far has been solid. I've had no troubles streaming and fowarding the stream via bluetooth works as well.Mpls. / St. Paul marketSouthern metroHTC Incredible on Verizon 3gThe Good:- Solid performance. No gaps in streaming either during or between songs.- Clean interface. Easy to navigate.- Stream can be forwarded via bluetooth (A2DP)The Bad:- Spendy - I'm hoping that the price get's driven down as adoption with cloud computing takes off. It's true you get the first year free but that's just the hook. After that you're looking at a buck a gig per year basically, or $20 per year. The pricing is also tiered so that you can't just add 5 gigs as you need them, it jumps from 20 to 50 to 100 to 500 and finally 1000 gigs, or a Terabyte. I would very much like to see this model disappear and be replaced with an 'on demand' model where I'm not forced into paying for storage I'm not using.- Auto resume - Currently when a txt message or call comes in the player pauses but does not resume once the txt / call is complete. (Updated 7/12/11 - This has been fixed)- External controls - Currently there is no external controls when the phone is locked. I have to unlock the phone and page over to the app to control the player.I will update as I gain more experience with this platform but I think this is a solid beginning."
Amazon,Excellent music service and a great add on for being ...,Magnaboss,22-Jul-15,5,Works well with my tablet and computer.  Excellent music service and a great add on for being a Prime member.
Amazon,Lacks essential feature,Peter G. Hamilton,6-Sep-12,3,"I have this app on a motorola droid 2 and on an Asus Infinity tablet.  I pretty much always play music from my device, but I have tried the cloud streaming on my phone, and apart from a slight delay in starting to play the song (probably due to buffering) it works fine.  I have both downloaded music from my cloud drive and uploaded it onto both devices and both work great.  My one major complaint is that once you create a playlist or add songs to now playing, you CANNOT drag and drop the songs to change the order.  You have to delete the songs and add them again in the order you want.  I usually don't use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to songs in a particular order if they seem to go together well.On my phone, the ability to skip songs or pause without having to unlock the screen is pretty nice, and I will give them credit that it is innovative.Overall, the app has functioned fine and played music fine, but not being able to easily change the order of my songs is a huge drawback."
Amazon,DON'T USE THE AMAZON MUSIC APP FOR PHONE STORAGE,robert magill,28-Mar-15,1,"Amazon, I keep starting to love you then learn why to do otherwise. Right now, it's that amazon music needs to use the phone's SD card for music storage!! How stupid are you to make an app I can use to let my kids access my music library and then make it crash all three of our phones unless we regularly, manually, move music to the sd card!??!! VERY STUPID and QUITE LIKE THE TAIL END OF A DONKEY, is my answer.Then, when you move the files, if they're sunc from the cloud, it wants to start putting them back and pretty soon the phones are crashing again for lack of internal memory. Bite us!"
Amazon,"Great idea, terrible performance",RCoover,21-Aug-12,1,"I uploaded all of my music, nearly 300 gigs, to my Amazon Cloud. The idea was that I'd have all of my music available no matter where I went as long as I had wifi or a cell phone connection. The problems began right away whenever I tried to access my cloud using this app. Often it would take 20 or 30 minutes just to bring up a song and the app would crash multiple times. It was terrible! I called cust service and was told by the rep there that they have the same problem. Their solution? Download the music to my device because the app was unreliable. This totally defeats why I got the cloud subscription and downloaded this app. It sounds like a great app but like most things with Amazon they rush them out and their performance is not stellar. Unfortunate."

Amazon,Not so much...,Barbara J,14-Jun-14,1,"Not enough to make me renew my Prime membership...I wish it was because I live where there is poor reception.  The downloaded songs are not all at the same volume so it is no better than the old Napster.  It needs a wifi connection so forget using it away from a connection like in the yard or at the beach.  The selection of ""free"" prime music is limited...and I like old stuff.Seems like everything I want to watch on Prime costs money and the free shipping is not really free since Prime items cost more...the timely delivery is the only benefit.  So....why would I buy Amazon's streaming device to pay to watch video ?  There are better alternatives for music and video service."

Will be canceling my music unlimited subscription.
Amazon,Mp3 downloads,Duane W. Smart,29-Mar-13,1,It used to be a piece of cake to buy and download a song from Amazon. With the introduction of the cloud you have to jump through so many hoops to get the item on to your computer it makes it frustrating. To top if off 2 of the last three downloads that are on the cloud and with help from amazon are on my computer. One of the songs was upcut and the other had so many pops and clicks in it I deemed it worthless. With so many professional noise reduction progrms available to the people supplying amazon digital services with product there is no excuse for poor mastering. By the way Amazon did refund my money.
Amazon,Surprised,Wave101,30-Jan-12,5,I titled my review surprise BC of all the poor to medicore reviews I have read. Let me start this review off by saying its not the developers fault the your carrier decided to load ur phone full of bloatware. So don't just rate something 1 star BC ur pissed u can't delete bloatware.MY devices Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Samsung Droid Charge(Verizon)This app is great in my opinion. It does all it says. Cloud play is great. I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost. If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive. All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited. However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small.  So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that's something to consider. Both players are equally good. I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music. personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player. The album view could also be made to look more aesthetic.
Amazon,some songs after I download don't play. Noticed more ...,Az Basecamp,27-Aug-17,4,some songs after I download don't play. Noticed more and more vanishing to their music app that you pay for. I might switch but for now what does download is excellent

Amazon,There's gotta be a better way to do this.,StreetMedic,26-Nov-14,3,"This app takes far too long to ""see"" new music you've bought.  Newly-purchased MP3s show up right away when you go to the cloud library web page, but they stubbornly refuse to let you just download them directly from there.  They insist/recommend you (read as: make as hard as possible for you *not* to) use this app to download them.  That would be fine, I guess, but then you have to wait around forever (or bang the app over the head by restarting it--sometimes more than once) until it dawns on the app that you have new music to grab.  Just let us download from the web page, already, please?  Frustrating."

I can understand some minor data transfer - I'm sure I'm ""paying"" with some form of information - but using hundreds of MB of my data plan in a few hours without my knowledge or involvement? And using cellular data even though I have the ""only use wi-fi"" checked in the settings? Very NOT Cool!"
Amazon,Good But Major Flaw on iPhone,N Holmes,23-May-14,2,"OK, I have the fully paid up version, some 40,000 songs stored on Amazon servers! The problem occurs when I am streaming on the move (unlimited data) and I lose signal on the phone. It shows a 'Cloud Player Error' then you can click 'OK' or 'Contact Us'. If you click OK you may get another error, unless signal is back again. If I am driving I just want it to work again so won't stop, press the contact button and write a message! Why doesn't it play from a cache, built up during times of good signal, or just pause until I get a signal back? I don't want to have to stop when I get a signal and push the button on my phone! Please, please, please, fix it Amazon!"
Amazon,I bought two albums but have no idea where my ...,Amazon Customer,30-Jul-17,2,I bought two albums but have no idea where my phone stored them. I can not find the files on my phone or the ad card. The music plays in offline mode with Amazon's music app.
Amazon,Won't play most of the time,Cloy Jenkins,13-Dec-16,3,"Most of the time it won't play, just says it's loading.  That's more like some free service.  But since I'm paying for Prime this should load and play like a paying streaming service."
Amazon,"Good app overall, Need support for download destination changes",Chris Meurer,26-Jul-12,3,"I have been a long time user of the amazonmp3 app. It works very well for my needs. I can quickly access cloud content, purchase music, download it to my phone, play from the cloud, etc.I need to be able to specify a different download directory. The app won't allow me to. When I attempt to move the content from one location to another the playlist duplicates every individual track. One references the old location (where the file no longer exists) and the other references the new location (where the file currently exists and can be played normally.) I contacted support and they were unable to resolve this problem for me. Their best suggestion was to manually go through and delete out the old tracks, one by one. For anyone with more than just a couple of mp3s downloaded to their device, this process can be very tedious, cumbersome and time consuming.The player works well enough. The music store limits the number of results returned on searches and in category views. This can prevent me from browsing music the way I would like. I would like to see this limit removed, and instead add pagination to allow me to browse more content.This could easily be a 5 star app, but these issues are glaring oversights that impact the overall experience."
Amazon,Changed,c crabbs,8-May-14,3,"I really enjoyed this app on my samsung s2. It was my prefered music player. I'd give 5 stars on the s2.I upgraded to an S5 recently. It has some features that need improved on the s5. I can find music in the store. But, I cannot in the cloud or on my device which makes it cumbersome. The S5 lacks the search button. I used on the s2. With my increased storage on the s5. I'd like to download all my cloud music. It would be nice to be able to see what is out of sync and download it like the desktop offers. I'll probably use windows and my sd card to sync the music because the player is cumbersome.I've started using the android player. It has the search function that isn't in the amazon app. It needs some improvement."
Amazon,"Excellent, but not ideal yet",J Daniels,6-Aug-11,4,"The concept of this cloud player has some wonderful benefits -- same library of content available to all your devices, regardless of where you are.  The fact that Amazon's library is based on the open MP3 format instead of any DRM format also makes it much more robust and useful.  This is the first serious competition to Apple's iTunes w/o most of the headaches associated with that platform.  However, there are some issues that should be addressed to make this a more robust player:1) The ability to d/l a playlist to your device without downloading the space-consuming songs in that playlist.2) The ability to shuffle the songs in a playlist.  Google Music can do this, and it is one of the few things it can do that Amazon Cloud Player can't.  This should be a simple s/w fix.3) When you display the list of all songs, it would be nice to see what playlist each song belongs to, if any.  It's a chore to search your entire library to find any orphaned songs.There are other features that I could request to make this a dream app, but these features alone would make it much closer to ideal for me.  Add these features, and I would give it a full 5 stars."
Amazon,Purposfully Confusing.,Stanislav Gatev,5-May-15,1,"The only rational explanation I can find for Prime Music being so ridiculously messed up is that Amazon is trying to confuse their users and have them spend money that they wouldn't otherwise. I could not find a way to see tracks which are included with Prime, and stay within Prime. They would insert one or two paid tracks in the search results. The UI is so clumsy and confused, I couldn't make sense of it. I am software engineer, and have seen many pieces of software - some good, some dab, and some downright ugly. This one is ugly."
Amazon,A solid first effort,Tyler Brandt,4-Apr-11,4,"Out of nowhere Amazon has a very compelling Android music player. Streaming works great and I didn't have any of the hiccups that I nearly always had with Rdio, MOG, Rhapsody, and Audiogalaxy, even on 3G. I think it even autobuffers the next song, which the above apps all failed to do, despite claiming it as a feature.There are a few features that would make it way cooler, though:1. Unify cloud music and device music. This could be replaced by a simple icon for one or the other, and would make it easier to see what you had on each, without flipping back and forth.2. Be able to access your wishlist/shopping lists from the app. Buying music and having it available instantly in cloud player is awesome, but it's a pain to have to go to Amazon.com to pick up the albums that I've already saved in my lists.3. Fix the uploader application for Windows. If you don't use iTunes or WMP, it has to crawl your hard drive and those results are organized by folder rather than tag, and on-drive folder structure is not preserved, which makes it excessively difficult to upload all albums by a given artist."
Amazon,Very nice addition to Amazon Prime,Rebecca,28-Jan-16,5,"Very nice addition to Amazon Prime.  I love it.  I run it on IOS (iphone), Android Tablet, and Windows 10 home PC.  It meets all my needs and allows unlimited skips and no commericals.  It also has a comprehensive selection under Prime.  I was going to sign-up for Apple Music, but with Amazon I no longer need or use iTunes.  The App and interface is so much better and easier to use than the stock music player for the iphone.  Nice job Amazon!"

Amazon,I like it.,rating pen,14-Jul-15,4,"I think Amazon Music is great as it is included with Prime Membership. There are so many free songs you can download, especially the old rock classics. I do find the format difficult to navigate which gets frustrating.  I wish you could download to the cloud and your device at the same time. I hate having to download the song to the cloud and then download it to my device also. Especially if I am downloading lots of songs. It takes sooooo long.  Once, all of my songs disappeared from my Kindle and I had to download all of them again. Not fun. Since it is included with my Prime membership, I really can't complain too much."
Amazon,Used all my data...,N. L.,29-Jun-14,1,"I've had my phone for a couple of years now (Motorola RAZR M), and Amazon Music has never been great. It won't let you download to your SD card, the whole app is clunky, etc. On the whole I don't use it much.Recently I hit my data limit. This usually isn't a problem for me. So I checked my data history and surprise, surprise, Amazon  Music decided it needed to do something so critical that it used about half of my data plan in the course of one day (465Mb?!). I actually need that data to do other things, like GPS navigate.No thanks. I've disabled the app. There are much better ways to get music onto my phone"
Amazon,Was better before,Pappy,21-Apr-17,3,"New features are nice, but seems like some old ones dropped or new issues with the new design.  I prefer the last version.This app has issues playing infrequent songs on my bluetooth in my Ford Sync3.  Also has an issue playing a few songs just by themselves when doing a playlist or queueing up songs, but when you click on the song itself, it seems to play.  Example is Blue Oyster Cult's TAKE ME AWAY.  All the time, is it the MP3 from the store??"

Amazon,Excellent!,Reader,26-Jun-15,5,"Thanks, Amazon for the elegant Prime Music system.  After much frustration with the unbelievably low-performing ITunes for PC to process IPhone and IPad media, and either ""losing"" music or unexpectedly amassing multiple copies due to using that app, I switched to Prime. I so appreciate experimenting with such a vast variety of very decent offerings, and I maintain an orderly library. Thanks to Prime's elegant design and function, enjoying music while I work is easy and effortless.  Great job!"

Amazon,Tons of free music,Amazon Customer,25-Jul-16,5,"I love this app! I have access to a ton of music and can play it on my phone, TV, and connect to bluetooth in my car. I pretty much only listen to Amazon Prime Music. The radio has too much talking and commercials and they play the same songs over and over. I can pull songs from my library or theirs and play what I want to hear. It was a huge incentive to renew my membership."
Amazon,Almost perfect,Dale S.,3-May-17,4,Good selection of music. Could use navigation instructions for use clarity.
Amazon,NOT HAPPY!!!,Live-love-life,6-Nov-16,1,Not happy!  Why is my amazon music (and I emphasize MY Amazon music that I purchased) invisible and immune to attempts to sync it to my other device in order to make space on my current device ....... I'm SO not happy after all the years of being a loyal customer I discover my music is not my own to do with it what I want to. Very disappointed.
Amazon,The latest version absolutely sucks,sheltonpro,11-Feb-17,1,"Takes forever to load (sometimes as long as 20 minutes).  While loading will send CPU to 100% capacity and then when it does it doesn't show the music you just requested to be downloaded after purchase.  You have to look for it and actually re-request the download.  This program used to work well, but since upgrade is a major fail."
Amazon,I love it and find the ease of use to be ...,L. Corey,27-Sep-16,5,"I tell EVERYONE about this app. I love it and find the ease of use to be perfect. I have nothing negative to say, and wish I made a profit off of the amount of people I make download this app!!! Prime is worth every penny even just for this app. Love that I can choose songs to listen to, add them to my library.. Tremendous amount of choices. So impressed."
Amazon,I will NEVER use iTunes again!,F. L. OKelley,22-Jul-14,5,"It took me about one week to figure out all the the INs-and-OUTs of the app on my iphone.  All I can say is that I will not EVER use iTunes again.  I have a total love affair with my iPad and iPhone, but I have never had any great love lost for iTunes.  Now with this really great application, I will not ever worry about it again...ever.First of all--if for nothing else--there are more than a million songs available on Prime Music.  You have to do nothing more than choose the music you want to listen to then download it to your device (even prime music can be downloaded to a tablet or smart phone).  When it has been downloaded to your tablet or smart phone, then you can listen without streaming.  Hours and hours of music, and a whole host of it for free!  There are also pre-created playlists that Amazon suggests, and you can add this playlist with a simple click, touch, or swipe of the finger!Then any music you have purchased in just about forever is available on your Amazon cloud.  The trick to getting pre-existing music from the cloud to show up on your device is to add a playlist in your cloud (which I just titled ""all my music"") and then select your music to add to a playlist.  Then once it's in a playlist, you can download all your music at once with the download arrow on your device.Also, if you have uploaded music to your Amazon cloud, that music is there, too!After you've downloaded music, if you don't want it, then you swipe the song to the left, and it gives you the option to delete.  (The same left-swipe option allows you to download single songs-instead all your songs-from the cloud.)This application works FLAWLESSLY on my iPhone.  A coworker has an android smartphone, and it works flawlessly on hers, too.This is now my go-to app for all my music.  I do not use iTunes at all.  I can find ALL my music.  I also like the various ways I can look at music, either in a list or individually.  I can mix so that I am playing tunes in random order instead of hearing the same list over and over again. I can listen to my entire Amazon music library on the computer, through my tablet or phone, just practically anywhere.This app is IT for me.  Thanks, Amazon!  Job well done...again and again and again.One more thing: if you're having trouble making the app work for you, then try Amazon's help link for the Amazon Prime Music App.  Go to Prime Music in Amazon, and keep clicking on links that say ""Learn more about Prime Music"" until you get to the Amazon Help.  There, you will find a three-minute video about Amazon Prime Music.  Also there are additional links in the left-hand column (if you're on your PC) that will benefit you, too.Happy listening!!"

Amazon,Moving from Pandora to Amazon Made Me as Happy as Moving from ATT to T-Mobile,Rick Mendes,21-Apr-17,5,"After years with Pandora, I gave Amazon Music a try. It was perfect timing. I had just switched to a new job where I can't have any of my personal devices on their network. So, what feature do I love best? The ability to download the music I love. At last count, I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for - even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them. Maybe I am missing it, but I see it if I listen on my laptop but not on my phone."
Amazon,Too Much.....,Lori Hockin,27-Mar-15,1,"I appreciate Amazon trying to get into the internet radio scene, but I would want the option between this and my plain Amazon app that just gives me access to my own bought music. I hope someone on Amazon payroll reads this."

I have a lot of old vinyl from the 60's and 70's and really surprised how many of them are in Amazon Music.  It sounds terrific.  I travel a lot and have had absolutely no issues listening via bluetooth in my car.  So now I'm reconnected with a lot of old tunes!  And check out lots of new artist too.  I highly recommend it.
Amazon,One Star,Amazon Customer,14-Aug-17,1,I hate that they tell you free music and every song I look for I have to buy.
Amazon,Not compatible with Kindle-Fire HD 8.9.....Why?,TomD,18-Sep-15,1,"Could someone please tell me why Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, does not make this app compatible with Kindle Fire HD 8.9? It works really good on my old iphone 4s and laptop."

Amazon,Bad album art,THOR,21-Dec-11,1,"I installed this on my phone and used it with no problems, until I imported my photos in. There was over 50 different album arts downloaded, most of which I never purchased and some was offensive. I don't know if this was a fluke or not but the way to see is  plug your phone into your computer, (make sure the USB connect is on Disc Drive on your phone) open up either drive E or F and look in amazon.mp3 and then look in a folder called image.pics or something similar, and look at all the .jpeg files ( you can safely delete the .jpeg files without screwing you phone/computer up).I like Amazon as a whole, but this in not right and we as buyers should be able to decide what we want on our devices, not someone else.This would be the perfect music player, except for this one flaw, so one star as I did not download any music with offensive album art.As always, with ANYTHING on a hard drive or something similar , do this at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you screw your device(s) up."

Amazon,"Great in concept, but...",Amazon Customer,17-Jun-14,3,"It's great having access to all this music as a Prime member. Unfortunately, I listen to music from my Android phone in my car most often, and that means streaming from the cloud is not feasible.Given that the app does not allow one to move the songs over to the SD card and that the internal memory of my Droid Razr has limited space due to other apps on the phone, I'm unable to download more than a couple of albums at a time. Makes this less than desirable as a service."

Thats brings me to number two, when a prime song does not work it will pause my play list so if I am busy with my hands I just sit in silence till I can skip the track. And my final problem is that it does not sync my playlists between devices or at least let me move my playlists to the cloud. It would be nice to only need to make a playlist once and have it on all my device or on the cloud."

Really getting old to look for a song I really like and the search come up with no matche results. Your selection of music by Moby sucks and so does the rest of your indie rock section. How do you have so little of excellent music.....get off the bandwagon and stop with the mainstream music of today...it's garbage.

There are also a lot of songs that are free with my Prime membership and it appears that list will grow over time. However, the app is constantly crashing on my phone and takes a long time before I can actually access any music from my library. I wind up having to use Spotify or Pandora more often because of an almost daily app crash (even if I haven't used it that day and cleared it from my cache)."

I know I have the cd at home, but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there, and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home (and kept the driver awake in the process, which was great). It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly. Very happy and made me appreciate the service all the much more (already love prime for the free 2 day shipping and use it all the time). I would recommend it to anyone who would like tons of music at their fingertips without a monthly fee."

Amazon,Works often,Plastidip,22-Jun-13,2,The downside of this service is that it often doesn't work. I often have to force quit the app on my iphone or reboot the phone to get it to stream music. I get lots of cryptic error messages. There is no public API. There is no support. Amazon seems to be doing everything it can to hide how buggy their service is. The file tagging and upload interface is at best a proof of concept thrown together by some students... Adobe Air? Really? Most of my album artwork is completely wrong... I have a number of albums whose matched artwork is not only incorrect but offensive. Wouldn't it be nice if I could upload my own artwork without uploading all my music again? The problem is that it's slightly better than the other options currently available.

Amazon,Will not connect to the internet,colvin millar,23-Sep-13,1,First I had the Amazon downloader for mp3 and that worked fine. Then Amazon came out with the cloud player and I downloaded the app. The music downloaded into itunes fine but it would download each song into windows media player twice. Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F.
Amazon,Best way to listen to music,Ashlyn Miniat,27-Jul-17,5,The best way I have found to get music is through Amazon. I wish (with Amazon prime) there was a feature to delete all music that is no longer allowed to be played without purchasing. But asides from that it's great! I do not buy the music service I just utilize prime and purchase songs I like!
Amazon,I like Amazon music,Jeanne VanHassel,1-Aug-16,5,I like Amazon music. I it at work. My work computer has a lot of blocks and restrictions on it. I work in a school so I understand why Lowe's restrictions are there. Amazon.com is not blocked on my computer. Therefore I can utilize the Amazon music service from the computer at work. This save data on my cell phone. Because otherwise I might be streaming music from my phone to make it through the day. I find the interface easy to operate. This service remembers I like and suggest similar kinds of music.
Amazon,Music Lover Here,Gulf Coast Livin,10-Aug-17,1,"Not worth my time.  This is the prime video of music.  I think most of the content on Amazon Video (included with prime) is junk.

Amazon,Music my way.,PMW,21-Aug-15,5,I love amazon prime music.  I listen to music while at home on prime as well as when I am traveling and I can't find any good radio stations.  Prime music allows you to listen to what you want to listen to when you want to listen to it. You can also download the music on your device.
Amazon,They have many songs. Biggest pet peeve is that ...,Erin,15-Sep-16,3,"They have many songs. Biggest pet peeve is that even if you have downloaded the song, it'll still stream online when playing if you are connected. Another big annoyance is that you can only be playing music on one device, which means if you share your account with your partner or kids or whoever, two people can't be lostening at the same time."
Amazon,Absolutely Best,Francis X. Guerrieri,12-Sep-17,5,The absolute best!!!!!
Amazon,Still pulls cellular data while on wi-fi,James Patton,8-Sep-14,2,The functionality of the app is a little tricky to navigate but the real reason for 2 stars is that the app on my phone still seems to pull data from cell networks even while on wi-fi! AND its a huge data eater! I have other music apps that pull dramatically less data and the sound quality is just as good to my ears.I don't understand how it can still seemingly pull all its data from the cellular network while on wifi.
Amazon,Amazon Molasses is more like it on Android,Lee Groomes,23-Jun-14,1,"As a prime member who has bought countless albums and songs from amazon, this app is now beyond useless for streaming. Every time I open it my list of music is empty. The service spends at least half an hour loading my cloud songs every time I open it, and that is even with a strong Wifi signal. Songs are still loaded to my phone's memory instead of the SD card, so downloading the stuff directly to my phone is a nightmare. The only way I can listen to my music is to download it from the site on my pc, then install it on my memory card and use the player, or another one, to listen to the songs. I don't know who is behind the development of the app. But if I were Jeff Bezos, then I'd put it into the hands of someone else. There is no reason that my entire playlist needs to be downloaded every single time I open the app. There is no reason that I should be denied the option of saving to the card instead of the phone."
Amazon,good music,sue sutton,4-May-17,4,still a lot of artiest unavailable. but loving it in general.please keep building your selection
Amazon,Great just not much umdergroumd stuff,Mark W.,4-Oct-17,5,Any music u can name
Amazon,Use  Itunes or Real Player,Marc W. Baisden,14-Aug-13,1,"Poor quality of downloads, skips and downloads stall. Not worth the time or effort. Don't waste your time and effort."
Amazon,Audio Stuttering In Unlimited Streaming,lrc13,12-Nov-16,2,Currently in trial period using Unlimited Music. Seems to work fine on my phone but I am experincing periodic audio stuttering when streaming via laptop. I currently subscribe to Spotify Premium and stream without any issues. I also did not have any audio problems when using Apple Music during their 3 month trial period.
Amazon,Second month in a row - ate up all my data usage,Judy Scholl,14-Apr-14,1,"Last month, after installing (and using once to listen to 3 songs), I get a notification from my carrier that my data limit had been reached.  After investigation, Amazon MP3 app had indeed downloaded 2.5 GB of ""background"" data to my phone.  I have no idea what it downloaded, but my plan was throttled until the end of the month.  After setting the ""download only on WiFi"" option within the application, again this month (just verified that the setting to disable download except on WiFi) another 2.3 GB of data was downloaded in the background.  I really liked this app, but I must uninstall it."

Amazon,Pleased,Annie,14-Sep-17,5,I am pleased with this app
Amazon,"Seriously, how is there not an external SD option?",Christoph W M,13-Jun-15,1,"Until you can store music on an SD this app will get 1 star from me. This is a simple fix for a problem customers have been upset about for years. All other features are moot point until you fix the basics. Why can't I choose to put my library onto my external card? You know damn good and well that internal storage is a fixed amount, small, and has to contain system files and other apps. Seriously, fix this. You could have it fixed in < a day if you wanted to amazon."
Amazon,but this app sucks. It is constantly stuttering,Amazon Customer,31-Jul-15,1,"Not sure if it is just streaming or playing back anything, but this app sucks.  It is constantly stuttering, and I know it is not my wireless network since everything else works flawlessly....  This WAS one of the reasons I had planned to keep Amazon Prime after the free trial, but it is basically useless on my tablet..."
Amazon,SD Card disabling killed this app,Disappointed,25-Jan-13,1,"This app was great at one time. I was able to download all mp3 files directly from amazon to a micro sd card. For some absolute unkown reason they've disabled that function altogether. The limited internal storage of the phone coupled with the brutal data allowances of verizon handcuff the use of this app at all.I loved having quick and easy access to my mp3 files from virtually anywhere, but now find this app almost useless.  Even went as far as uninstalling the app updates to strip it back down to the original version; which actually allowed the files to be saved directly to the sd card, but found that amazon has completely shut down the ability to sign in.In short....a year ago or less this app was a 5-star. Today it's less than zero."
Amazon,Four Stars,Godloving,4-Sep-17,4,"Really good app, I just whish it was possible to buy music from the app!"
Amazon,A good music app(for prime members),MSMJ Shaffer,24-Mar-15,4,"While I opt for Google Play Music for my music needs, it's nice to see Amazon provide a simliar experience with their offering.  What I find is that this is an amazing value for Prime Members.  The library isn't as diverse as I would like(but I have very specific and more foreign tastes from the norm) so for most people the selection should be quite nice.  If you need a music app that lets you add to your collection without adding extra cost, this is the one!"
Amazon,When it Works...,Sasha C,12-Aug-15,3,"I really like to listen to this service at work on my PC. There does seem to be a fairly comprehensive selection of free music. What annoys me (and its happened twice this week - and its only Wednesday) is the Music Player is always going down, or offline, or just stops working. Sometimes I get an Amazon ""internal error"" message, but most of the time it just stops. This is so frustrating, and for such a comprehensive site, it seems really ridiculous."
Amazon,Amazon Music purchase run around,Richard Cooke,11-Dec-15,1,I have purchased and 'downloaded' several CDs on my android using Amazon Music. They are available for offline play on Amazon Music but not for my android based music players.I am a JAVA computer developer so don't tell me it's me. And of course there is no documentation or worthwhile blogs or forums. So I download my music I purchase from Amazon on my PC and upload to my android. The wonders of automation.
Amazon,Five Stars,Richard M. Karasek,4-May-17,5,It great piece to have tons of music to choose from! Loving it!

The only thing you left out was the ability to select a letter in the alphabet and look for artist with that letter. It was in the old menu and wish it was in this one. Keep up the good work you guys are awesome . Keep my stock going up.Tom
Amazon,Worth the subscription,ed,13-Jun-16,4,Use it every weekend.  Whether working or lounging...  love the radio stations.  Some songs not available without purchase.  Some 60's and 70's I can get on Youtu.be but not on Amazon...  But overall I will continue to subscribe to Prime.
Amazon,I like that you can besides play any music you put ...,Aces N Hole,8-Jun-15,3,"I like that you can besides play any music you put on your device. You can download a  MP3 copy of any Music DC's or Vinyl you have previously purchased from Amazon Music. It means that I will definately be buying all my Vinyl and Cd's from Amazon from now on. I like having the non-digital hard copy product along with the digital product.I'd give it five stars, but I don't like that they put identifying info into the digital files so if you share files on the internet they can be traced back to you.( I think they may do that to any media on your device that you play in this service too). I don't do that but if your computer gets hacked and the files are shared on the internet your in for headaches."
Amazon,Offline/downloaded Library no longer plays,Allison,2-Sep-16,1,After the aug 10th update I can no longer listen to my offline library (songs ive downloaded to device) ive used this app for over a year with no issues. I get an error that says i need internet connection.  yes i checked to make sure i selected offline playlist. My phone settings allow data when im not on wifi. Any future fix?

Amazon,But they just took off all of my my favorite artists discography,Alejandro E Ruybal,19-Apr-17,1,"I've used amazon music for years. But they just took off all of my my favorite artists discography. This is ridiculous. The app was a good app but now that they've taken the good music off/ made it only accessible if you pay for amazon prime unlimited, it's not worth it anymore."

Amazon,"Such potential, such crap",Amazon Customer,19-Mar-17,1,Constantly freezes and crashes on my iPad mini.  Must restart two to three times before it can be used successfully.  And so slow.
Amazon,First Graders Rock This App,Heather,7-May-16,5,I love using this music app in my classroom. We use it for everything from quiet writing and reading music to dance parties and reading lyrics to KidzBop for fluency practice!
Amazon,Amazon TOTALY FAILS on Amazon Music,Larry J. Schaefer,25-Jan-15,2,"Amazon has blown music management deep into the ditch.  You would think that tech giant Amazon could muster the resources to create an intuitive interface to manage music, lists, etc.  The barrage of album covers,  miscellaneous graphics,  and numerous random  confusing interfaces and control button consoles.  AMAZON king of internet marketing, you shamefully missed the mark on providing a music player that is commensurate with the quality culture you are known for in providing merchandise."
Amazon,One Star,JaR Denver,4-May-17,1,It has been stopping playing after every song for about a week or so.
Amazon,MP3 is a good app,squ33ki,2-Oct-13,5,"Simply put, I like this app for music.  The problem, it doesn't update enough on the mobile side.  When I'm on Amazon.com using my computer, everything is up to date.  Also, there is a significant lack of old-school 80's/90's era of rap.  Not hip hop, just rap to include west coast and hard underground tracks I grew up loving.  It wasn't always just NWA or Dj Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince..."
Amazon,Love it,Sharon Yvonne,28-Jul-17,5,I love it very much.
Amazon,"Horrible update, slowest loading program ever",Kindle Customer,13-Oct-16,1,"Horrible update. They pushed out, I don't know, something but it takes *forever* to load, it's counter intuitive (you need to select from category up top for artist or album, *then* from the left hand side, *then* I can hardly figure out what to do then.That's when it actually loads, that is. AWFUL."
Amazon,amazon. MP3.,"Bond, James Bond",1-Dec-12,5,"its amazon. Its an MP3 player. Oh shoot its a love child!!!!!! I like it plenty, when i hear a song on amazon I like I go and buy it from amazon so it keeps all my digital content localized and available on the cloud. plus amazon always has promos where you can get free music. i just got a $2 credit just for being a prime member!"
Amazon,Meh.,Amazon Customer,19-Mar-17,2,App is atrocious and the music selection is oddly limited.
Amazon,Five Stars,CLeggett,20-Jul-17,5,listen all the time
Amazon,Streaming has clearly missing sound in the music. They try to make a smaller file and takes away quality. No amazon!,John,23-Dec-16,3,Would give it 5 but the sound quality is poor when streaming music. You can clearly hear missing music. This is just not going to work amazon. I want to hear all of the sounds in the song not what remains after you cut it to make it a smaller file size. Music lovers will never go for this.
Amazon,Great,Kayna,1-Jul-17,5,Great product music anywhere
Amazon,Do not use this. Worst software I have ever used.,S. Rose,3-Dec-16,1,"Worst software I have ever used. Refuses to ignore my iTunes library, takes 5 minutes to start on a 4Ghz i7 despite only a few hundred tracks loaded in it. Interface was created by people with no concept what-so-ever of how audio products or modern software work. Absolutely avoid at all costs."
Amazon,Doesn't work properly,Amazon Customer,23-Jun-14,1,"First the app. It plays one or two songs, then stops. I have to hit the power button and swipe the lock screen to get the app to go to the next song. This pretty much defeats the purpose. Ergo I no longer use this app. I just listen to Pandora or Jazz Radio instead.Second, it's a nice idea to add extra free music for Prime members, but for anyone that listens to something other than current pop rock it's pretty useless. So, that's another reason to no longer bother with Amazon music.Too bad as the previous app worked perfectly."
Amazon,Even dinosaurs can manage this fun app,Barbara,18-Jul-17,5,How fun is this ???
Amazon,So Much Potential... But Short of the Mark,Trent Prather,14-Oct-12,3,"Andriod smart phone users need a quality Cloud experince which Amazon is well positioned to provide.  However, while the price is reasonable the user experience is lacking.  If one were to use Pandora as the benchmark then the Amazon MP3 Player is limited in the features provded and user interface is lacking.The recent ehancement of ""upgrading"" uploaded music looked like it might be a positive step towards  ""iTunes"" level service.  However, the upgrades were limited and since the initial migration I have not had a single uploaded song meet Amazon's upgrade criteria.  As such, it has become more of a quality detractor.Bottom line, the Amazon Cloud experience is ""okay"" but has work to do before it can earn those extra stars..."
Amazon,"Missing David Bowie albums, new Tedeschi Trucks album",Robert Eaches,9-Feb-16,1,"I am disappointed because the albums I really want to hear are missing. I left Spotify to go to Prime and am now sorry. I hope this service improves substantially. I guess they thought the Beatles would suck some folks in, but that only lasts so long. Most major artists are missing. 90% of new music is missing. I will ditch the Amazon prime next year and return to Spotify."
Amazon,"Needs to improve discover attributes, add related artists, and expand radio content",Amazon Customer,29-Jun-16,1,"Clunky, not intuitive, a horrible platform for expanding your listening. No related artist function. For setting the standard in creepily tracking shopping trends, this music service does ZERO of that for your music. The radio content is woefully poor. This platform needs a f[iretr]uck ton of improvement before I come back to use it."
Amazon,Get serious Amazon!,Meekay,8-Jul-14,1,"App needs alot of work.  App stutters anytime I switch networks even though the music is downloaded, not streaming, very annoying. Now I get an error when I try to play music. This is why amazon will never compete with other providers. I stopped using amazon appstore because every time I get on a plane it couldn't authenticate and all my apps were worthless. Also the EQ does absolutely nothing. Get some better programmers."
Amazon,Greedy bastards,Amazon Customer,18-Jul-17,1,Literally taken away all my favorite songs for there bull unlimited crap.This was awful.Dont download this.If you want musi use something else cause they use every new song for the unlimited.You have to buy songs already but unlock them with the new unlimited.Screw that
Amazon,Awesome app - needs a few tweaks.,T. Joseph Street,13-Sep-16,4,"I LOVE this app.  The music is great, the volume/sound quality is incredible.  I would ask though that they please for the love of GOD support landscape mode!  That is the only reason you don't get 5 stars.Also, hopefully with iOS 10, you'll soon support homescreen widgets showing what's playing now."

Amazon,I hate it. It does not play my music all ...,Amazon Customer,4-Aug-14,1,"I hate it. It does not play my music all the way through. I had the old app without the prime, with the green logo and that worked fine. Since I upgraded this is what I have. This is garbage. I can't listen to one single song without it looping. I try to listen to my music everyday, but this app will not allow me to. Oh, well just uninstalled app and I will think twice before downloading music to amazon cloud."
Amazon,Terrific app.,David Dekker,30-Jul-17,5,Terrific app.
Amazon,Useless,Laurie D,17-Apr-15,2,Sigh... This app is...a pain. Used to be better. About a month ago I used to be able to browse my library looking at the album art. Now 70% of the art is totally missing and despite removing those albums and uploading them back on there is no change. It's effected even those purchased through Amazon. I do not recommend this app.
Amazon,Buggy App.,J.W.,27-Sep-17,1,Crashes or wont start on Samsung S7.  Deleted app and repeated downloads dont help.
Amazon,Horrible battery drainer on iPhone! Fix the app!,Jeffrey Hurvitz,15-Dec-16,1,This app is really draining my iPhone battery. Way more than equal usage with Spotify app. Something is seriously wrong with this. Over 41% of my battery usage in the last 24 hours compared with 18% for the Facebook app which I use constantly. Wow! Horrible! Someone fix this app!!!!!

Amazon,Consistently fails to play albums that are on/in the Prime library.,Muffin,2-May-16,1,"Constantly failing to play music that is currently available in the prime library (items NOT grayed out)  This has been happening consistently for weeks now.  Amazon keeps saying they are working on a solution for the issue, but no info beyond that.  From my own searches, this is the response they have been giving for months.  Very frustrating."
Amazon,Three Stars,brad,30-May-17,3,Great app. Not crazy about last update. Drains battery ALOT
Amazon,Great app but confusing,Dennis,5-Dec-15,4,"Cool app, it's a bit confusing though as to the difference between just selecting ""add to library"" when choosing a free CD (because it's a Prime CD) or selecting ""download"" CD. If I download something that's free because of my Prime membership, what happens if/when my Prime membership expires? Do the songs disappear or stop working then or what? Why offer to let me buy the CD if I can download it for free?  I guess I need to read the FAQ page or something but this is very confusing."
Amazon,Pays for itself in free shipping alone.,Karl W.,21-Jul-16,4,Works great while you have it but I let my Prime account elapsed  and at the moment I don't have the extra $99 to be able to subscribe for another year and don't have access to all my music that I downloaded. Had I known this I would have uploaded it to another cloud or downloaded it to my USB drive. I never got the chance to watch any of the free movies but I'm sure they were good as others have stated. I do miss the Free shipping which now really sucks.lol
Amazon,Thanks,Kathy Banks,30-May-17,5,Just started using it.
Amazon,"Come on Amazon, you can do better than this...",Joe K.,3-Jun-16,3,"Ever since the most recent rounds of updates, I can stream effortlessly, but if I have downloaded the song, it will just spin for as long as I let it without playing the song. Very annoying."
Amazon,Not Good,D. Zorn,4-Apr-16,1,"App is too huge and clumsy. Very hard to find recently purchased music. Automatically includes songs from cd's I purchased years ago and have no interest in including in my current library. Keeps pushing for Prime Music which I do not want. If I don't have it, get it off the app. All the different lists are too much. Some don't even make any sense."
Amazon,I think the software is generally good with one significant exception,Mr. J. Ballard,5-May-15,2,I think the software is generally good with one significant exception.  Getting a recurrent 'unable to copy file' message attempting to download pushed system updates is frustrating in the extreme (Grrrrrrrrr!).  Post suggest that suspending antivirus software (in my case BullGuard) during the re/install resolves this problem but it doesn't; nor should the software be designed in a fashion that requires this type of unsafe system prerequisite.
Amazon,cool,Amazon Customer,10-Jun-17,5,"idk, it worksthe widget is nice too"

Amazon,Amazing,Jzackial Reviews,16-Dec-16,5,"What an amazing benefit and reason to get Prime. Tons of artists, plenty of space to add songs and create play lists. The x-ray lyrics is a great feature as well and follows the song pretty well. At times the x-ray lyrics can lag behind the song but Im pretty sure this is because Im listening via blutooth in my car (happens on utube as well). Overall its an amazing music player with tons of free music and pre programmed stations. Highly recommended!"
Amazon,They keep taking music away.,Ziggpop,22-Oct-17,2,"I have had Prime a little over a year now and it seems like every time I save albums to my library and go to listen to them later on, about a third of what I originally saved is no longer available unless I want to upgrade. Not much of a benefit if you ask me."
Amazon,Its good.,Bayou Boy,23-Jan-16,4,Its pretty good I must say. I barely use it though to say a lot. I remember having a issue. That's why I give it only four stars.
Amazon,Worst music player I have ever used,Finn,13-Jun-16,1,Worst music player I have ever used. I am a prime member and I won't even use it. It's not worth the frustration. I'd rather listen to SpotifyÛÜ adds than struggle to use Amazon Music.
Amazon,Vast selection of music and artists!,As I See It,21-Aug-17,5,"I listen at my desk through the Tap. The music selection is vast, from stations to albums and artists, there is something for everyone. A great alternative to radio especially if you have poor reception inside."
Amazon,Amazon mp3 Player for Android won't download to sd card,Shelster,31-Aug-13,3,"I love the Amazon mp3 player! It's easy to use & I love having my entire music collection right there on the cloud for download anytime I like. The app is large but it allows you to move it your phone's sd card. Which is nice because my phone's internal storage is limited. However... I bought a 32gb sd card for my Droid X2 to have more room for music only to realize, after downloading a good portion of desired tracks from my extensive cloud music collection, that Amazon mp3 player will only download to my phone's internal storage. How can this be rectified???"

Amazon,Very buggy app,William S.,27-Aug-14,2,"I just cant seem to make this app work! It is extremely sluggish, at times not showing the music. The download function seems hard to access. Keeps showing 'Loading songs' but never seems to finish loading. Don't think it's my phone, I am using a Samsung S3. You would think that would be more than enough processing power to run this app? There have been numerous app updates, but none is better than the previous one. I would much rather use Google Play than this music app, it's much more functional and stable."

Amazon,It is missing many favorites from each of the last 5 decades.,mrgillard,21-Jan-17,4,"Without the upgraded Amazon Prime Music account, the regular Amazon music is missing many of my favorites from each of the last 5 decades.  It is especially thin in the 70's and 80's music, with a few people I like having only one available song from an album without upgrading to Prime Music, or paying for individual tracks.  The comedy is also weak."
Amazon,It makes me very sad. And frustrated and more frustrated,Maria,13-Jan-17,2,"I tell people that Amazon is my ""crack""...I'm currently going through withdrawals and it stinks!  The app crashed on my computer and I can't function without it during the day!  I've now spent over an hour of time trying to get the app up and running.  It makes me very sad. And frustrated and more frustrated!"
Amazon,"Good app, but...",Ivy,11-May-12,4,"The player performs flawlessly, but does so only from the phones internal storage.  More importantly I cannot find an option for storing downloaded music to any alternate locations.  I have manually moved my music to a newly installed SD card.  I hope the player will see the music there.  If so, all will be well.  The player itself can happily reside on the phones internal storage while the data rich music is on the SD card.  The only other ding I have on this app is the equalizer.  I wish it was more sophisticated."
Amazon,not for phones more than 2 years old,bullittchase,19-Jan-16,1,"I used android 2.2.2 and this app is too advanced for my ""ancient"" phone.  Even though every other major competing music app is available on my phone.  How advanced does an app need to be just to play music?  Basically this app requires more advanced technology than was needed to land a person on the moon.  Ridiculous.  Amazon acting like Apple again."
Amazon,Brilliant with no commercials!,Ricardo Pazos,30-May-17,5,I use the stations with my android phone casting to my car receiver connected by blue tooth. Streaming is ver good even when 2bars 3g connection is available. Better then Pandora when you already have prime with Amazone.
Amazon,Five Stars,Kevin K.,9-Apr-17,5,YOU KNOW your the best
Amazon,Love the music,David's gal,1-Jun-17,5,Awesome songs
Amazon,Two Stars,Kael,4-Nov-17,2,500 song limit on playlists makes this fundamentally fail at its purpose. Would be 4-5 stars otherwise most likely.
Amazon,My digital music and cloud player,laura collins,4-Dec-12,5,I love my cloud storage and player. I have bought many mp3 downloads from several media services and have lost all my money when my phone or mp3 player was lost or broken. But with my Amazon digital purchases they are stored free on my cloud and I can get them anytime anywhere and play them on the web. I dont feel like Im wasting my money because I will always have the music I bought and even other music downloads that I already had on my computer because I can import the songs I didnt buy from Amazon. I even get free songs from Amazon that I didnt ask for and its music I love. Its great to know my jams are safe and secure and will always be there when I want it. Thanks Amazon Digital.
Amazon,How to find this app in the appstore...,Mira,6-Feb-15,3,"I just downloaded this on my Fire phone and it's currently loading from the cloud, so I can't speak to it's performance yet but I do want to let you guys know that you have to type in ""Amazon Prime"" in the search bar rather than just ""prime,"" or else it doesn't come up.  I called Mayday because I couldn't find the app and he couldn't find it either.  Hopefully this will prevent some frustration amongst people having the same problem."
Amazon,One of the best apps ever,Tip,26-Apr-16,5,"One of the best apps ever.  I have used this for quite some time.  If you are a Prime member it is a must have, especially since it's free.  You have access to thousands of songs from every genre of music.  You can create a library and store all of your favorite artists.  You can also download the music to your device in case you are on airplane mode on vacation or whatever.  You can also listen to stations, similar to Pandora, except there are no ads."
Amazon,Total waste of Time,Skimamma,2-Feb-16,1,"Spent hours going through their catalog and creating a playlist to find out that contrary to their claim you can't download any prime music onto your computer (oh sorry that's wrong, out of the 45 songs I put in my playlist I was able to download a whooping 2 songs.) So, the small MP3 player I just purchased on the Amazon website to use while I am running, the MP3 player that just plays music files and doesn't load apps, the MP3 player that I will now be returning to Amazon, is totally useless. They should show this information in big bold letters from the get go instead of leading you to believe that you can download music onto your PC. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY PRIME MUSIC FILES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER. So, really not sure why they are calling these songs you can't download ""Prime music"", certainly makes it seem as though you as a ""Prime member"" would have access is a bunch of crap. I guess they are trying to justify the $99.00 a year fee they charge by giving you what amounts to another Pandora or Spotify. What a waste of time, and now I have an app I have to uninstall as well or maybe I should just run with my Kindle strapped to the side of my head."
Amazon,Good app.,Richard,4-Mar-17,5,Use it daily.  All good.
Amazon,Ripoff!!,Sean Sudduth,17-Mar-17,1,Already paying for songs. The most recent update wants another $120 a year on top of that . No thanks.
Amazon,good luck. Hardly any selection for music you don't ...,paul kirsey,29-Mar-16,1,"It's ridiculously convoluted to use.  If you're searching for a specific band or artist, good luck.  Hardly any selection for music you don't have to pay more money for.  Even what's available to buy is pathetic.  I've tried to use this app for a couple weeks to see if it got better by learning how to use it but no.  It's useless."
Amazon,No widget? UPDATE: there is a widget,Charles,12-Dec-11,4,Most recent update killed my widget for this app. Please fix ASAP. Other than that I enjoy the app. It's simple to use and I like having my music library handy wherever I may be.UPDATE:  I have recently moved the app from my SD card back to the phone.  There is a limitation to the Android operation system that doesn't allow widgets if it is on your SD card.  After doing this I was able to use the widget once again.  I have upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I do wish that the player had the ability to let me customize the equalizer to my tastes rather than the preset ones that they have.  Lately I have been creating playlists in Amazon and then using the cubed (3) player to play them as the sound is better through that player.Using Droid Incredible 2.
Amazon,Five Stars,LINDY,6-Apr-17,5,works as described.
Amazon,Why Amazon?,Amazon Customer,13-Jun-14,1,"Amazon screwed up.I want to be able to listen to my music with ease, and not worry about accidentally purchasing music.The screen for purchasing amazon prime has an error where you cannot click ""not now"".Why Amazon why?! You had something gold and s*** on it.Please do not download because it is a waste of time. The old version was 100% better.Amazon MP3= GreatAmazon Music= Windows 8"
Amazon,"oh, hell, no!...really, Amazon?",Tammy Minton Haley,23-Jul-15,1,"...cannot access my Prime music on the Roku App...seems like these Prime Membership bonuses have tangled strings attached...can't use the Amazon Music App to stream Prime music...extremely difficult to access the Kindle benefits...incredibly ridiculous AppStore download process...very limited selection of Prime movies, even less television...unless something changes, i cannot see myself renewing...free shipping is everywhere...get over yourself, Amazon..."

Amazon,Amazon Prime Music is life.,Robyn Dianne,14-Feb-16,5,"I am obsessed with Amazon Prime Music or what ever I'm supposed to call it. I downloaded the apps on all of my devices (MacBook, iPhone, iPad). I constantly have something playing and there's always something new for me to enjoying. Being a Prime Member has never been more rewarding! I wish I had started using Amazon Prime Music right away!!"
Amazon,Mind-numbingly slow. (OSX Version: 4. 0. ...,Brad Kinder,13-Jan-16,1,Mind-numbingly slow. (OSX Version: 4.0.0.949.4.0.2.570)I am only using it to build a few playlists for my Echo. I have to wait up a minute to be able to move a song to a playlist after moving another song.
Amazon,Good deal,Jorgy1911,15-Jan-16,4,"Prime music is great is set up for phones loads of free music of your choice. Takes a while to learn how to access it in app but is good. Cannot access this from anything but phones or Amazon products tried to use on roku will not play my music unless you have purchased music and that is all you get just purchased. I understand promoting your products ,kindle ,fire stick etc but we all do not just have Amazon products. Would have given it 5 star rating otherwise"
Amazon,Bluetooth issues,Robert Wilkens,22-Jan-16,1,"Seems streaming to a car radio with bt, that songs are broken into 3 to 5 second clips, and there are a lot of hiccups.  Almost want to ask for partial refund on amazon prime, as this replacing pandora was part of cost justification for prime.  Support at amazon acknowledged this as a known issue, if they fix it i will revisit this review."
Amazon,Still Needs Improvement,Dianne A. Thurman,28-Mar-17,2,Have always had problems withÛÜ Your Music app
Amazon,Awesome!,2yorkiemama,4-Apr-17,5,I've been using Pandora for several years.  As a Prime member I decided to take advantage of this and give it a try.  I really LOVE it.... I picked several artists to create different genres.  It's excellent at the selections it gives.  You can still thumbs up or down and/or skip.  And NO commercials!  Definitely worth it.  I may just give up my subscription to Pandora :)
Amazon,Most counter-intuitive of any music apps.  Terrible.,Thresher Klier,15-Apr-15,1,This is for the Amazon Prime Music for the Samsung Galaxy S6.... absolutely terrible.  The most counter-intuitive of any music services I have encountered.  The search mechanism is impossible - the stations are difficult to manage and good lord turning the thing OFF takes an act of congress.  I struggled for a few hours while watching a movie and just decided to uninstall the app.  Too bad - Amazon does so many things well.
Amazon,Three Stars,L  Pierleoni,28-Apr-17,3,Good selections
Amazon,Frustrating!,History Buff,17-Jun-16,2,"Not cool. Can't play music I BOUGHT except on the app. Even though I downloaded the music I bought, I can't play it offline. No more buying music on Amazon, I guess."
Amazon,Excellent---Better than Pandora,JF,2-Dec-14,5,"I listen to this every day at work and on my phone when walking the dog.  The music selection is vast and varied.  The Prime Stations are better than Pandora.  I have even used it to play music for our Oktoberfest celebration.  I have yet to find anything bad about it. The only problem I encountered is that I downloaded so many songs that I ran out of memory on my phone and had to delete some.  They are, however, still in my library in the cloud.  I enjoy the recommendations that are listed based on the music I am listening too.  As a result I have found artists I would not have looked into otherwise.  I highly recommend the service!!!"
Amazon,worthless junk!,Joey R. Kong,1-Feb-12,2,"I finally got this piece of junk app to start working with my PC after 45mins of messing with setting for my firewall, antivirus, and windows media player. Only to find out I downloaded my entire song purchase 3 times (like 150 songs)---guess what!? I cannot remove songs!!! So I have to download 450 songs to get my 150 songs, piece of crap!! Yeah it was my fault for clicking to download my queue 3 times while trouble shooting, but no choice to stop downloading, or remove songs. SUCKTASTIC, MORONIC, SIMPLISTIC, GARBAGE! Plus I read a lot of the other negative reviews, and they seem to be accurate. I only give it 2 stars because right now technically speaking it is working (and I have a 9mbs connection) SO it's only going to waste a few hours of my time."
Amazon,Incredibly slow downloads,Dione Greywolfe,22-Aug-14,3,"I love the prices and collections of classical, New Age and other genres of music available from Amazon. I just can't believe how incredibly slow downloads to my Windows Media Player program on my PC is.I have 100 Must-Have Vivaldi...downloading now and it's been going for 15 minutes and still isn't finished. I looked for an option that would allow direct downloads to my MP3 device. Not there! I have a sattelite ISP that's very fast with any other download I choose--but not this app."
Amazon,Fantastic,Thomas Murawski,21-Jun-14,5,"I use my Kindle Fire at home to listen to music. Now I just grab my phone and get in the car and hook up with the blue tooth and have all my music with me. It's the same simple format as the Kindle and I can play right out of the cloud without having any music on my phone and all. I read all the reviews complaining about the app size. And I'm surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they can't get the music to their SD cards. It's a business process, not a personal issue, or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit. Maybe even put a soundtrack to it."
Amazon,Three Stars,Del B,22-Aug-17,3,You have to pay to get some songs.
Amazon,User-Antagonistic App that doesn't CARE if you want to download your library efficiently,David Valdez,13-Sep-14,1,"I keep trying to love this app. Yes, they did improve it, but it STILL won't let me download ALL of my music from the cloud to my computer. I KNOW that Amazon wants us enslaved to their cloud, but the reality is that Internet connections are not as reliable as Amazon believes. Could this be because Amazon lives in a wired city? See, I live in Portland, OR and we are very wired, too. HOWEVER, crap happens and with the Amazon Music app, you either download EACH album individually, which is tedious if you already have a large music library, OR you suck it up, Buttercup, and use the cloud. When is Amazon finally going to tell their sweatshop developers to have a ""Download All"" option in the app so that those of us who want to listen regardless of our ISP's current availability?!I'm sorry, but this is about as user-antagonistic an app as I've seen in a VERY long time, and I'm specifically talking about the new player, not some old one."
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,20-Sep-17,5,Just learned of Amazon Music and like it a lot.
Amazon,Five Stars,Hope Main,10-Mar-17,5,Love it! Perfect!
Amazon,One Star,K L,10-Jul-17,1,I'm not going to get it due the other comments.
Amazon,Excellent evolution,Eric Sinclair,10-Apr-11,4,"I've had and used earlier iterations of the Amazon MP3 Application on my android devices before, but the continued evolution - and integration with general Amazon features - is promising and pleasing. Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing (challenging as that might be to represent).This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I'd love to see two additions:1/ integration with the lock screen (ala Songbird)2/ Support for the scrobbling standards (e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers).Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I couldn't see how best to add enhancement requests directly."
Amazon,Had to uninstall,Master Tim,15-Jun-14,2,"The new version with the prime music library seems great. Unfortunately when I tried to play a song I just got a revolving circle over the play button, which would not go away. It slowed down the phone completely, drained the battery in minutes and caused it to overheat. I had to uninstall it. Samsung Galaxy II. I repeated it several times to make sure something else wasn't responsible."
Amazon,I had used what I can of this music app ...,Juan J Guevara,12-Apr-15,3,"I had used what I can of this music app with my Amazon Fire Phone, but I feel Amazon is treating the owner of their Fire phones as second class. I can stream play lists, but I can't stream Prime Stations. The irony is that I can stream this stations on my wife's 2 years old Samsung and not on my new Fire Phone.I can't give 5 stars to an Amazon app that I can't use 100% on my Amazon phone.Juan J Guevara"
Amazon,If I have to use this app to get my ...,JASON P BAILEY,5-Mar-15,1,"If I have to use this app to get my purchased music, I will find somewhere else to get my music. PERIOD."
Amazon,Great for the computer or ipad,Randall,27-Sep-14,1,"Great for the computer or ipad, but terrible for an android phone - almost useless.  The app will only use the phone's internal memory to store its data. It doesn't take long to completely use all internal storage.  Streaming works ok, as long as you have decent cell service (and unlimited data plan) or Wi-Fi.  Takes a lot of management - delete what you don't want to listen to today, download what you want to listen to before you head out - who has that much time?"
Amazon,One Star,J. Bomar,14-Aug-17,1,Would not install.
Amazon,A Good Deal,Belinda Bumble Bee,6-Jan-16,5,"I can download a ton of songs from an endless selection to my library and listen to them on my phone with the amazon app. Even though I have a Walkman I often plug my phone in and turn the speaker on so I can listen to all my songs as I move around the room with nothing to encumber my movements. I hesitated to pay the annual fee at first, but now that I have it I'm glad I decided to get it. Will undoubtedly renew my membership when it runs out!"
Amazon,Not compatible?,mrmikemrmike,6-May-17,1,Why not?Amazon should invest in apps that are backwards compatible.No Amazon customer should have to buy a new phone to use the Amazon Music app.
Amazon,Unable to save downloaded MP3s wherever you want.,D. Clark,6-Jun-12,3,"This app downloads MP3s to a directory called ""Amazon Mp3"" on the internal storage of your device.  Many Android devices these days, especially tablets, can take external expansion cards (eg microSDHC cards), and it is common for people to choose to store their media in external storage.  This app doesn't allow you to choose where you want to store your downloaded MP3s."
Amazon,Stop profiling people,behe,25-Mar-16,1,"I wanted to listen to ""the hills"" by the weekend and it couldn't find it. It did bring up a different song by the weekend. So I did a search for G easy and it played one of his tracks I never heard before. Amazon, you have judged me to only to like what you want me to like! That's no way to make a profit."
Amazon,The App constantly crashes and has a horrible user interface...,BB,20-Jun-14,1,"The app is extremely difficult to use.  It defaults to the local MP3's on your device.  Why in the hell would I launch the Amazon Prime app to listen to my own freaking MP3 files.  They make it extremely difficult to stream music.  Then, when you finally figure it out, the damn app crashes.  Amazon Prime is not worth the money.  I will be cancelling my trial before the 30 days."
Amazon,wish I could with out buying two prime accounts,BT,6-Feb-16,1,"My husband loves it so I thought I would try it out, but because the account is under his name I am unable to log in on the same account. I think that it stupid for people who are married to have to have to pay for two prime accounts, that would be a waste of my money. I was really disappointed not to be able to try it out."
Amazon,Bait and Switch,Someone,19-Nov-12,1,"I'm one of the thousands of people who trusted Amazon when they said they were offering ""unlimited"" free music storage on Cloud Player. Given the initial bugs with their service, it took me a lot of work and time, but I eventually got my music on Cloud Player. After a few months, Amazon changes it to 5 GB. After another few months, Amazon states that there will be a 250 song limit but that limit wouldn't count previously uploaded mp3s.  Fast forward to last week: I tried playing some of the songs that I uploaded when Cloud Player was first announced, and I found that all of my uploaded songs were gone. The only songs that remained were the music that I purchased from Amazon over the past few months. Today I find out that your previously uploaded songs don't count towards the Cloud Player limit because Amazon moved all of my uploads into Cloud Drive where I can't access those songs from Cloud Player which makes it useless. Like many other people I'm not willing to pay $25.00 just because Amazon is being dishonest due to poor planning. In the future they shouldn't promise to offer services forever that are not financially sustainable, just to gain a temporary edge over competitors like Google.I can honestly say that I've been a loyal Amazon customer over the years. However if this is a start of a new trend with Amazon I guess I'll be shopping around for a new favorite store to patronize.I'm also sure of another thing: I won't be buying music from Amazon in the future. Conversely, Google treats my music files fairly. and that's where I'm moving my future media purchases."
Amazon,The Amazon MP3 app and music ecosystem is terrible. Does Amazon understand digital goods?,Ignatius Hsu,13-Apr-13,1,"The Amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word, ""horrific"". Skip this app, save time, save the $24.99 annual fee, and use Google Music instead. Google Music is a competing cloud service free for up to 25,000 songs, and it just works. It's available from the Google Play storeThe Amazon MP3 app is buggy, clunky, looks dated and doesn't even offer genres for browsing through your library! Bluetooth cuts out frequently when I listen to songs through the app on my tablet. The app design says 2009 and it eschews the Android Holo design language for Amazon's awkward Kindle theme. The app starts you off on a screen where you have to select ""Store"" or ""Player"", and it doesn't seem to remember your preference, so you need to select ""Player"" each time you restart the app. That adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen, which disrupts your listening experience. The app doesn't support genre browsing. You simply cannot use your music catalogue's genres. Don't bother with the Amazon MP3 app or Amazon's music ecosystem if you do any of the following: (1) purchase digital music (2) consume digital music (3) manage your music library (4) value your sensibilities as a consumer of music.The cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly Web based. You must supplement the Web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions. The desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad. Purchase songs and they're saved to the cloud and made available for free through Amazon Cloud Player. An ok start. Album art is 500px by 500px, also great.The rest of the Amazon MP3 experience is problematic. Album art from purchased songs is massive. A 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous. Metadata is messy. Artists are not tagged correctly and Amazon makes no distinction between the Album Artist vs Artist metadata fields. Album titles have random words capitalized. Songs are inconsistently labeled. I need to re-tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer. So much for the phone app. Oh wait, you need to install a desktop app to download multiple MP3s, and you also need Adobe Air. And you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs. You also can't push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud (you need to make a list of each updated song, sign in to cloud player, delete each song, one by one from the cloud, then select each song from your desktop, and upload each song to the cloud. if you thought you could simply delete an album from the cloud and re-upload it, you're wrong.).Google Music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience, is well integrated into Android, supports Genres and follows Android's design language. Google Music does this right. 25,000 songs uploaded to the cloud for free. Song management is almost perfect.The Google Music app starts up in the tab you last visited, so if you were in albums or artists, it picks up where you left off. You can purchase music, but consuming it is the heart of the app. Amazon's MP3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app's users go to it to listen rather than shop for music. Songs I purchase from Google Play have tagged file metadata correctly (nice, Google!). Album art is perfect, Web optimized at 512px by 512px (close enough for me). The app has genre filtering and browsing. It allows you to randomize songs within a genre. The cover flow is very spiffy. I've invested time in getting my album art consistent so I could browse music visually as well as through metadata. I can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app. The app uses the latest Android Holo design language, so looks consistent with the rest of the Android apps. It functions great and has a lock screen widget.Pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on Google Music, but nothing like the 80 steps per album Amazon experience. You can delete an album with two clicks. After that, it's 6 step process you complete once per batch of updates, whether it's an album or 100 albums. The cloud service is truly cloud based, and the user interface is elegant and intuitive. Like Amazon MP3, you need desktop software to upload music. Unlike Amazon MP3, in Google Play you can effortlessly download an entire album, delete it, or edit its metadata from the cloud, without the need for additional desktop software.The Amazon MP3 app is the opposite of Google Music. Go to Google Play, search for Google Music, and get started with an amazing music listening experience."
Amazon,It WAS great -- before they began charging for it,GobiasIndustries,8-Aug-12,1,"I loved this app, it was great to download all my Amazon MP3's directly to my phone, or providing the ability to stream them if I didn't want them taking up memory. Now Amazon has decided to make users pay $25/year to have as much music on there as you want, or you can keep 250 (Amazon mp3's not withstanding) if you don't want to pay for it.It was my go-to music app, but I don't like restrictions on the music I put on my phone, and I sure as hell won't pay $25 a year to access the music I already paid for or uploaded to my cloud drive on their site. If I'm paying for the extra storage space through Amazon Prime, I should be able to do what I want with it."
Amazon,Not Perfect but Better than the Sound of Silence,Hanala Sagal,7-Sep-17,3,Echo often can't find the song unless it's worded in a specific way. Hope they improve it.
Amazon,Hate it,J. Woody,18-Jan-17,1,I can get past the horrible GUI but not it eating up over 45% of system resources everytime I launch it.  Brings down the whole system.  Bring back a simple web interface for uploading/downloading/managing instead of the windows app mess.
Amazon,Please let users control where to download the music!,ULong,2-Apr-15,2,"Like many users out there, the only complain I have is that it's missing a simple function to be able to download music to external SD card.  I don't know why this cannot be implemented, is it due to some policy or what?  Without this function, this app will be short life, half useless."
Amazon,Just started using...,P. Snyder,27-Jun-16,4,"I just started using Prime Music this past weekend, but it never asked me about installing a shortcut icon on my phone.  I have to go through the ""long drawn out way"" to access music...and then figure out how to find my playlist.  Seems weird to do it that way, so maybe I'll ask my son when I see him this weekend."
Amazon,No Chromecast audio support -- No amazon fire TV stick support either.,John Galt,30-Mar-16,3,"Kinda pathetic that it can't cast music to Chromecast audio pucks, or even the Fire TV stick.Bluetooth is a pretty crappy way to connect to good speakers, and has all the problems of limited range, etc.If you use it for headphones only, it should be OK.  But it's not a solution for home audio."
Amazon,Three Stars,MI User,21-Nov-15,3,Meh - run-of-the-mil for a atreaming audio service. Nothing special. Similar to most others out there
Amazon,Used to like it...,T. Meisinger,1-Aug-12,1,"I was really excited to download this app for my phone.  I previously had uploaded almost all of my music to the cloud.  So, when I got my new phone and the app, I was happy to have almost my entire music library at my fingertips.Then came August 1st...I am a Prime member, and I remember when I started using the cloud.  They said that songs would not count against my 5GB of free cloud storage.  In fact, the web page still says that.  However, when I went in to my cloud player on 08/01, I got a pop up message saying that I could only have 250 songs imported songs for free.  An imported song is anything you didn't purchase from Amazon (although that is not true because many of my imported songs are from CDs I did purchase from Amazon).So, I have until 08/31 to have all my imported songs on the cloud.  After that, I will need to pay for anything over 250 songs, and I have over 3,000.  It will be $24.99 per year, I believe is what the message said, to keep all my imported songs on there.  Now, just over $2 per month is not a lot of money, but when they tell you that you have 5GB of free storage and that ""This space is yours to use as you like and you will never be charged for it."" (that is quoted from their website) and then they change it on you, it leaves a bad taste.I have deleted all of my imported music from the cloud.  I have been a big supporter of Amazon and bragged about their cloud player and the benefits of Prime membership.  I have also touted the Kindle Fire.  I'm very disappointed with the way Amazon handled this.  I have uploaded all my songs now to Google Music (20,000 free with them) and will just use their player from now on."
Amazon,"the battery would run super hot, and nothing would work",Valerie LOBK,6-Nov-14,1,"This would mainly be something I would use in my car to stream music. I have plenty of favorites added to my music list on Amazon, and installed the app on my phone. Each time I tried to use this on my Samsung S2, the phone would freeze up, the battery would run super hot, and nothing would work. I would need to restart my phone to get anything working again. Tried this multiple times, never was able to get any song to play. Uninstalled."
Amazon,Frozen on launch.,be the ball Danny,10-Apr-17,1,"Does not function at all. Frozen upon launch, and installed some bloatware: Amazon Music Help.exA surprisingly bad product from Amazon."
Amazon,it is crap.,Steven Jones,16-May-15,1,I installed this app after Amazon refused to allow me to download and of the music it offered me through Prime for free. Amazon said I had to have their app and a phone. I installed the app. It won't even take me to my playlist. It doesnt offer to play any music and won't acknowledge that such a thing as a playlist even exists. I uninstalled it 15 minutes after installing it. it is crap.
Amazon,older was better,jameskoiman,29-Jul-14,2,"It was pretty good until they redesigned it now it is more complicated and the default homepage is prime music,I want my music to be the homepage and if i want to buy some more music than i will go there.The fact that the mp3's download to internal storage is really stupid!!!that is why we have sd cards ,so we don't hog up the internal memory,the app was more usable before!C'mon Amazon...listen to your customers for a change instead of trying to sell,sell,sell !"
Amazon,Doesn't Understand Classical Music,Bill,11-Jul-16,2,You have no idea how classical music is performed.  You mix up movements as you think a movement is a song not a part of a whole piece of music.  You even play a section of a movement and jarringly cut to something totally out of character with what had just been played.  As is so with most sites you are totally focused on popular music.  Google is the only site that seems to get it mostly right.
Amazon,MP3 on iPod Touch = FAIL!,Kendal,14-Jul-12,1,"Thought this would be a great app to have, since I've got several songs on my cloud drive. I used an AmazonLocal voucher to get three songs I wanted, Amazon had them, voucher = 3 for free! Sweet! Loaded from cloud to device no worries. Built a play list, success! Start driving and blasting tunes. iPod goes to autolock, player quits. Doesn't do this with iTunes player. No way in settings to keep playing when in sleep mode. So to keep music playing, I have to constantly fiddle with my iPod. But, I can't put it to the home screen, or it stops playing. I like to listen while working, but won't ever be able to listen to Amazon music cause the MP3 player is CRAP! CRAP CRAP CRAP! Worthless for a player that quits when the device screen goes dark. I've scoured the net for answers, and found no answers, but this same issue across multiple devices, including phones, tablets, etc.Can't believe this app was rushed with such a simple flaw NOT ADDRESSED!"
Amazon,"Navigation is Difficult, Annoying",John,23-Jun-14,1,"It took quite a while to figure out how to navigate their menus and having to keep limiting the search to ""prime only"".

Amazon,Great music app,Maren,19-Apr-16,5,I just upgraded my phone to the new Blackberry Priv which is powered by Android and therefore I finally have the Amazon music app. It was very easy and fast to download all my music I had purchased over the years through Amazon and can listen to it on my phone. Awesome app!! I love Amazon!
Amazon,Crap,Amazon Customer,23-Nov-16,1,"Massive lack of content! I had Spotify before and there was never a track I couldnt find, now I'm impressed if I do find music! Gaps in content are horrendous! If you subscribe to a music service you expect it to meet all your needs!"
Amazon,It does do what it is supposed to and it ...,Thomas Myers,3-Aug-15,4,"It does do what it is supposed to and it does have the ability to download Prime or purchased audio for offline listening. A major improvement would be the ability to choose the path, or at least drive, that the music is being stored on. You cannot just move the files over to your external SDcard as you will get errors. Some have said that you can use a file manager to move purchased audio to an SDcard and it does check to see if their are in fact file on one."

Amazon,Awesome Amazon,Eric,22-Apr-14,5,Use this application to play songs on my samsung galaxy phone. Ordered CD copies from amazon and got free MP3 as well. They are stored in my amazon cloud which is also a nice feature.
Amazon,Why make it so hard,JC,19-Jun-14,2,"It hasn't crashed yet and it is responsive.  Those are the only two reason it gets two stars.  There is no way to exit.  It leaves a persistent notification that won't go away until the hit the 'x' around 10 times and back all the way out of the app.  Sometimes you can swipe the notification away only to have it come right back.  It only works in vertical orientation.  I was able to download prime music, but it took three times to get it to actually download."
Amazon,Great tunes! When the application runs.,7mmgal,2-May-15,1,"First off I would like to say that I love the music Amazon Prime gives me access to and the ability to make so many Playlist, and also the Playlist that prime provides using your genre of music. But, and it's the reason I will most likely not renew Amazon Prime this year, because free shipping and shopping does not make this app. worth $ 99.00 a year. But constantly being unable to listen to a full Playlist is a pain, and it's frustrating. Its not how long I'm listening to the music, because Prime music will stop after 5 minutes or stop every 20 minutes, and I get a notification saying Amazon Prime has stopped. Would you like to report or close program. I have reported it  many times, with no result. So my only other option is to go back to Google Music play. I'm very disappointed with Amazon Prime, I was so excited about the Prime Music, but now it's just frustrating to try to listen to music using Amazon Prime.  I'm writing this review in hopes that someone else has had this problem and found a way around it. Based on the music I would have given 5 stars, but the apps constant stopping rates it at 1 star."
Amazon,Awesome!!!!,Carl McManaway,27-Feb-16,5,"Love it!!!! 5 million stars! I ask everyone what they want to hear. And no matter what artist or song it is, prime has it! I love that you can listen to me some or albums before you buy and you can download songs to your phone and listen offline!

But, there is a very big issue of this app - some users cannot use it, even if they live, earn and spend their money in UK. and this is why, becouse this app only accept english language in our phones. We are living in free world, and not everybody that live in UK have English on their phones, if they can chioce something else. So, when you get different language (becouse you prefer it) you will not be able to use it. thats very big issue, becouse this users can buy music from their computers, that are also in diferent then english language, but on their phones NO!"

Amazon,Fix the music storage location problem!!!,Thomas C. Mayer,8-Sep-14,1,"I loved the app when I tested it. It's easy to use and imported all of the mp3s on my device, including from iTunes. So why one star? It does not allow you to specify where to store the songs on your Android device. They are stored on internal storage by default, which makes it virtually useless as a music app. Considering how easy it would be to fix and that I can find discussion threads about this going back two years = one star."

Amazon,Just ok.,Christina L Chaffins,1-Jun-16,2,A little confusing to navigate.  Lacks a favorite option for station though does group recently listened stations.  Overall Prime Music is good if your tastes lie in general popular music but limited with other genres.  How do you not have a Grateful Dead station???
Amazon,Won't connect to the Internet,Kevin,29-Apr-15,1,I had previously given this app three stars because the latest update deleted my playlists across all my devices.

Amazon,A Must Have for All Music Aficinadoes,wilmofree,14-Jan-15,5,Great Application - the music is great especially because you can download it to your own device.  Have it on two iOS devices and use it daily.  You can download or listen to your favorite music from just about any era.  My wife and I listen to good reading music at night when we are reading our Kindle Touches.  Highly recommend this to music lovers of all ages.  Great part of Amazon Prime.
Amazon,"Not ready for ""Prime time""",Harry Piels,3-May-15,2,"At first I was optimistic that his would be a great find. Then reality sunk in. I think most customers want the original music that made the charts. Here, remakes seem to rule.( Oh I get it, the originals are mostly not free). It's often hard to weed out the (inferior) remakes by listening to one short sample. You can get caught with a bunch of lousy remakes you bought without knowing. Some artists seem to have remade almost every song and usually. they aren't close to the quality of the original hit song. Maybe that's why the popular music scene is suffering compared with earlier times: don't bite the hand that feeds you.. I also noticed songs being added to my playlist that I didn't want. Don't know why, but annoying. They also kept throwing albums and choices out that  weren't even close to my preferences.Many searches for songs that were in the top twenty found no hits at all.. I hope this improves. It's a great idea.,to have music as a benefit .and I did get a few playlists together with the (original) music I love, but at a cost..."
Amazon,Some technical improvements would make it better,Tristan,23-Feb-16,4,"I generally like Amazon Music. There a few issues : some of the classical recordings are not the most recent, many are in MONO but they are still good performances. It's annoying if there are sections of the recording missing. Also, if it's a very long band (over 40 minutes) and you pause it, you are not always able to go back to the point that you left off. It would be better if you were allowed to skip ahead."

Every week there is new music to check out and I lcan download my favorites on my mobile devices. Even has new releases in the genre that I listen to... Metal!My only complaint is that the cloud storage for my personal library is limited, only allowing me to get a fraction  of my own music collection uploaded. I would like to have it all in one place instead of having it split up with another cloud service. All in all, one of the main reasons I joined Amazon prime and it has been worth it."

Amazon,Useless without external storage option!,Insanelycool,11-Sep-15,1,"I want to like it, but this app is entirely useless without the ability to store the cache and files on external SD. Might as well pay for google play music so that you can have a choice to store files and streaming cache externally.

Amazon,Prime Stations Suck!,Daniel,17-Jul-15,1,"The music selection is awful and sub par.It has a fraction good streamable songs, the ""top songs"" might hit 3 songs on the top 40 and that is about it.The stations are repetitive and pull from a small sample of songs so through-out a couple hour listening time all the songs seem to be exhausted and begin to repeat."
Amazon,Android App lags with large music library,G. Kohtz,5-Aug-11,3,"Currently, my Amazon Cloud Player library contains 22,884 songs.  I love using the web-based Cloud Player on my pc to listen to music while at work.  Unfortunately, with the amount of music I have, the Android App (HTC EVO 4G) becomes very slow and crashes frequently.  I think problems are caused because the app is trying to locally cache my music library's index, so the app knows what music is available to stream from the Cloud Player's server.  The AmazonMP3 App's Data usage grows to just over 54MB after downloading the ""index"".  And that data stays on Android's internal memory, also causing space shortages on my phone.Once playing music, the app does a good job.  Rarely do I hear skips during a song, even while streaming over 3G connections, and song playback starts within reasonable time of hitting play.I would like to see Amazon refine the the AmazonMP3 App to work more efficiently with larger Cloud Player libraries.  Then it would become THE cloud-based player for me."
Amazon,NO stars for you except the I have to give you,sam rutherford,11-Aug-15,1,This has become ridiculously difficult. I chose a huge group of music and got five song. Which I bought.

Neither option works, and I am stuck with a welcome screen.  I uninstalled/reinstalled the app, but to no avail.  This now makes 2 Amazon apps which are no longer functional on Android (Instant Video being the other one).  Makes me rethink my subscription."
Amazon,Greedy company,Mark LaFrance,17-Aug-17,1,Thought it was free with my prime subscription.  However you have a very limited selection unless you pay even more money. No thanks...ill stick with Google play music. If im going to have to pay ill stay with what I already have.

I hate the load/reload convert drama going from different MP3 players, so I thought that I would be in music heaven with the Android app. NOT so much. There are way too many issues with buffering for me (I have a Motorola Atrix) and most times when I have tried to use the app I have been in 4G or on Wi-Fi. I like being able to access the cloud player via internet, but I really wanted to have access to my library through my phone, and just have that device as my MP3 player.

Amazon,So much for having to quit buying CD's,VITSOL,11-May-13,1,"I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I DON'T! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?"
Amazon,"It's good, but could be better.",PhotoMommy,30-Dec-16,4,"Random play still needs to be actually random. If I hit play from the first song on a playlist, the random set is always the same.

Amazon,Wasn't broken until they fixed it.,Alexander VanArsdall,29-Jun-14,2,"This was my music app of choice until recently.  There has been a recent update to the software that kills a lot of the user friendly functionality.  The app doesn't remember where you left off in your play list (or that you were using one in the first place), forces you to set the shuffle and repeat functions on every time you open it, etc.  It's obvious that the app is meant to help you buy music, rather than enjoy it."
Amazon,Hate IT!!!,Susie Trevors,22-Jun-14,1,"I don't want to use the cloud.  I have my own cloud.  This app gives you no option to send you PURCHASED music any place other than their stupid cloud.  To transfer it to another device requires a convoluted, laborious process that is different every time I buy something.  This is the reason I don't use I tunes any longer."
Amazon,New app sucks!,Amazon Customer,6-Nov-16,1,"The new app is horrible! When I search for new music all I get is Gospel or African Tribal, which I'm sure are wonderful genresummer, but I'm not interested in either. I want to buy music from you! Fix it!"
Amazon,Streaming fail,Seth C. Martin,27-Apr-17,1,I can't stream more than a song or two before it randomly stops playing in the middle of a song.  Persistent problem across two phones for several years. Get it together amazon.
Amazon,OS X keyboard integration,T. Conant,15-Feb-16,5,I'm writing this review purely to praise the OS X keyboard integration with the music navigation keys. I use the app for prime music station streaming.  In comparison to the Pandora desktop app where they didn't take the time for those details in their desktop player.
Amazon,Too complex by far. Why can't playlist and downloads ...,David George,4-Sep-15,2,"Too complex by far.  Why can't playlist and downloads to mp3 be simple, direct, labeled?  Is it too much to ask.  Too many electronic products are written by geeks for geeks and no by users."
Amazon,Thought I was going to love this app!,Amazon Customer,16-Nov-16,2,I loved this app until I realized I can't make the Playlist I wanted. Can't even find The Chronic and have added some Warren G songs to a Playlist 5+ times and they still aren't there...Guess it's back to Spotify!
Amazon,What A Waste,Kristopher Matthew Graham,27-Jul-17,1,I'm about to cancel my prime membership.  I lose music that use to be included and now the app has stopped working.
Amazon,Hate this now and will take it off my computer,pmom1226,2-Dec-16,1,Unlike others I had never had problems with this app UNTIL the recent update. Hate this now and will take it off my computer. Hard to tell what has already been downloaded and very confusing.
Amazon,Cant share misic app,Big-O,28-Feb-17,1,So i cant share this music app with my family. I need to pay aditional fees for family unlimited music. This sucks i will have to go back to spotify and cancel Prime membership
Amazon,"Good beats, decent selection, no complaints",Dchon,1-Jul-15,5,"Prime music is great. Especially if your phone has unlimited data. Then you can listen to your heart's content while working out or in the office. The user interface isn't the best, but if you tap around and search you should be able to find a station to your liking. I really can't complain when this is just another one of the many features of Prime and there are no commercials."
Amazon,Needs to allow music to fade or pause while map ...,James Cotsonas,20-Sep-17,2,Needs to allow music to fade or pause while map apps are talking.  I cannot listen to music and pay attention to directions when they are fighting to speak.
Amazon,WILL  NOT WORK,Cassie B,22-Dec-14,1,THIS APP WILL NOT DOWNLOAD! I pay for prime and can't even use IT!!! I have a newer version of the kindle fire and it still won't work. Prime Music would be nice considering I got an ALL NEW kindle because it wouldn't work the first time! Get with it Amazon!!
Amazon,Five Stars,Natalie Cihan,26-Sep-17,5,no commercials with prime!!
Amazon,Gets worse with every update,Jack Mazzotti,5-May-16,1,"Designed by an completely incompetent ignoramus. Gets worse with every update. It stalls, can't download properly, too many menus, cant just click on an album, forgets where you left off, always wants to shuffle like only an idiot want to do"
Amazon,I am constantly amazed at the value that comes with a prime membership,Amazon Customer,15-Mar-16,4,"I dig it. Didn't even realize this existed.  I am constantly amazed at the value that comes with a prime membership. Yes, I wish there was more music, but man, I do prime just for the free shipping, everything else is a bonus. And this is a huge bonus."
Amazon,Doesn't work well through my firewall...,esimpson1,1-Jan-12,2,"If I connect directly to my FiOS Wireless router, I seem to have no problems.  Virtually everything else (including 2 hotspots) are forced to go through my firewall.  If I connect to the Cell network, I have no problems.I can't seem to find any indication that I should open any ports in my firewall to allow the MP3 app to work.  Very frustrating because I definitely like the app (when it used to work with no problems).  When I go into the App and say, try to load the most popular songs -- it just hangs with a circule spinning indicating it's waiting for the list to be delivered.Anyone have any thoughts?"
Amazon,Good concept ruined by terrible implementation,trickdick,5-Oct-13,1,"Make no mistake the amazon mp3 cloud is an attractive concept. But the current implementation is woeful. Lack of functionality means that the 'player' simply serves a (useful) role as a downloader from the amazon cloud. But given the lack of ability to direct downloads to the external sd card, you may as well not bother with this app. Shameful on Amazon that they *could* make this so good, so useful and so popular, but instead have chosen(?) to implement so badly."
Amazon,Poor versions of the songs,Joe H.,22-Aug-17,1,"Most of the songs I have downloaded are not sung by the original artist or when the song is sung by the original artist, it is a remade version from the songs we know and love. Very disappointing."
Amazon,Disappointing and ''feature'' rich.,William S. Frisbee,6-Apr-11,1,"Tried to purchase an album, it gave me the choice to transfer it to my cloud drive, I said yes, it said error and now I cannot download my album to my cloud drive or computer.  It has been almost two days and I have yet to get a response from support or find some way of getting the album I paid for. Not the first time something like this has happened to me on Amazon with the MP3 downloads.Major Fail.  I think I'll have to buy music elsewhere and play it on more stable platforms."
Amazon,Music Review,John,7-Oct-17,2,Difficult to use.
Amazon,I love being a PRIME member as it gives me access ...,Amelie Decleor,21-Oct-17,5,"I love being a PRIME member as it gives me access to wonderful healing music like Aeoliah, Liquid Mind, Baroque, etc. I love the selections on here. Sometimes when I don't find a good movie on Prime, I just stream the music and it so relaxing and healing."
Amazon,keep trying to extort $$,Pbone,26-Jan-17,2,Not what I thought. Spend more. And more. The basic service kinda sux and I aint paying for extra. $99 a year is considerable money to spend on mediocre products. S P O T I F Y!
Amazon,Five Stars,C.M.G,3-Nov-15,5,
Amazon,A downgrade from most music services,Nick B,23-Jun-14,2,"Compared to most music services this is a downgrade. Makes exploring new music in certain genres very difficult. A prime (har har) example is Dance & Electronic where everything is lumped into one. Sorry, but there's over a hundreds sub-genres of Electronic (let alone Dance) to just clump it together. Perhaps when Amazing becomes serious about music other people will take it more seriously as well."
Amazon,love the app but need to fix the inability to download to external SD,cjcullen,27-Jun-14,2,"I love almost everything about this app. All kinds Of music (which a bit of is for free), but not everything. Plays music that wasn't from the player, but again everything. But the biggest problem I have with the app is that you can't change the download path, or download to your external SD card, so all of your internal memory is loaded up with all your music.Will rate higher of fixed"
Amazon,"Cloud player on apple, finally!",seaway jan,23-Jun-12,3,"It is finally there for IPhone. I love it. I have bought 10 mp3 albums already. It is a win win for both amazon and apple.My complaint:1. Some Chinese title songs had random code for artist or title name when uploaded . Cloud drive also distinguish between lower and upper case letters! Fix these!2. Please accept apple lossless format somehow! I know there might be some legal issue, but one way is to convert it to amazon format when upload, with user confirmation of course.Looking forward to more use of cloud drive and cloud player!!!"
Amazon,Explicit lyrics in music - can't filter,Cruzing,18-Feb-17,1,We play music stations on our Echo but there's no way to filter explicit songs out. Should Amazon care that kids are listing to music with F-bombs? We are finding alternatives.
Amazon,Unbelievably good!!!,Camille,1-Aug-17,5,Music on the go! A totally new concept for me (I'm 66). I have it on my computer but to add this to my Android is incredibly good. The options are seriously endless. I am absolutely thrilled to enter into this new way of listening to my favorite music.
Amazon,My phones store would soon be full if I purchased all the music I'd like. I have a 64GB sd card installed that ...,Donald W. Koenig,31-Jan-16,3,Come on Amazon. The app asks you iof you want to store music on your phones sd card and then does not allow you to do so. My phones store would soon be full if I purchased all the music I'd like. I have a 64GB sd card installed that will be a good start.
Amazon,Small selection,Caleb,27-Sep-15,2,Its easy to navigate. Nice. But small selection of songs... doesnt even have George Strait... or acdc... time to upgrade your collection amazon.. then ill give 5 stars
Amazon,Amazon Support:  Epic Fail!,Brian Greene,4-Dec-16,1,"I was using this fine on my Mac, then it quit working like so many other people have said.  I have contacted Amazon support, they have no idea what's going on.  Totally useless."
Amazon,Doesnt work,Eric,20-Jan-17,1,"With the prime video and music apps update, now they wont even play or open.  This is bull and im pissed.  Im not going to pay for membership or use amazon if its like this."
Amazon,Finally a membership that is truly built for customers.,Tuffy,6-Feb-16,5,"I LOVE this feature! One more reason why Amazon  IS AMAZON! I'm not an 'APPLE ' drone- years of ipod music regulations have been frustrating, I am thrilled with finally having  a viable -MUCH BETTER- alternative is music to my ears! no pun intended _Ù÷ "
Amazon,anyone have suggestions,Ron Reves,19-Nov-15,3,"works well but I can't download prime music. I travel 2 hours a day, in a rural area, I have to stream my ??FREE??prime downloads over and over from the CLOUD to listen to Prime music. I am beginning to wonder at the  value of being a PRIME member. I can get free shipping from other vendors, and I can a lot of inexpensive downloads on the web."
Amazon,Worst app ever,Brian Gibson,18-Nov-14,1,"Freezes or crashes constantly. If I mount my phone to my computer, or restart my phone, it deletes most of the songs off my playlists. If I try to play anything out of the main song list, it defaults back to the first song in the library after about 30 seconds. Worst app ever. Oh, and as an added bonus, the desktop version won't even load on my computer."
Amazon,It is great. Navigation can be a little tricky,Myla Mirdo,11-Dec-14,3,"I downloaded this on my pc. It is great. Navigation can be a little tricky. Info does not update simultaneously. What I meant is when I added the album in my library, it is still unmarked when I search for prime songs in the store. I have a kindle and hate that there is no music app!! Are they joking? Why is this not on your product?? Disappointed."
Amazon,One Star,Bob Reviewer,30-Jun-17,1,"User interface is useless and worthless. Search function might as well be called ""RabbitHoleå©"""
Amazon,After almost two years and millions of devices sold with ...,C. High,4-Dec-15,2,"After almost two years and millions of devices sold with Prime tied in, Amazon STILL hasn't bothered to include any sort of parental / explicit content filtering! So despite paying for the service, I can't safely allow my kids to use it on their new Fire tablets."
Amazon,Beware: hearing damage,Mr Creosote,24-Sep-13,1,"Like all music players for smartphones, the music stops when the user gets a text or call. Immediately on resuming the music track, the volume is up FULL BLAST for a second until returning to previous levels. So... imagine you're listening to your music on your earbuds, you hear a beep to announce that you have a text, and immediately you are BLASTED with a music track. Damaging, poorly programmed and a stupid bug that any QA team should have spotted."
Amazon,My get on up (& dance.app..),LuckyLeeLee,10-Feb-15,5,I love my Amazon cloud player.. I purposely got a smart phone so I could have everything in one place. Amazon cloud allows me to do just that also I grew up with my parents always listening to music & my kids grew up the same way. And all generations liking there oldies now I can listen to them anytime I want while I'm busy running around being a mom... Thank you Amazon Cloud
Amazon,Titles stuck in BMW bluetooth?,Jonesy 66,11-May-15,4,I like the service but won't use it in my BMW because the album title and album art does not transfer after the first song is played so it continually displays the first song only.  My iTunes radios works perfectly so I will continue to use it until Amazon Prime Music fixes the bug in the software.Thanks
Amazon,Massive limitations,twocups,16-Apr-15,2,"Exceptionally amateurish implementation. Won't let you specify where to store your downloaded MP3s, which is a deal breaker for me. Clogs precious internal storage with streaming 'caches', album art and such. The old Amazon MP3 Player app at least had a equalizer which worked quite well for me - this app has none."
Amazon,No longer available in Saudi Arabia,Amazon Customer,9-Jun-17,1,So I have been using Amazon music  for the last couple of years up until today as the app kept closing. I uninstalled in order to reinstall only to discover the app is no longer available in the country I am currently living in (Saudi Arabia) very frustrating grrr.
Amazon,"""There was a problem playing the current song, skipping it""",Dino,9-Jun-14,1,"I downloaded my entire amazon library to my local machine and it refuses to play.  Both local and cloud based songs will yield an error ""There was a problem playing the current song, skipping it"".That's kind of basic functionality right there folks.I even made sure that the program was pointing to the correct local files on my drive.  It was.  Epic fail."
Amazon,Skips really bad.,wcran98,10-Jan-16,1,All of the music played on this app skips. I really wish they would fix it. I have uninstalled it and tried it on some of my other devices but this app skips really bad and I am not the first to have this problem. I really wish Amazon would fix it.
Amazon,This sucks your memory,Sunny-the-Bunny,21-Apr-15,1,"DON'T USE or INSTALL this app Ever! This sucks your memory, every 10 minutes will refresh cloud and clog your bandwith, or force you to buy storage - songs. The worst music app ever used by my ... I agree with most of the 1star reviewers that, this Amazon App SUCKS and as if I am back to 64k dial-in Age!!! Stupid and Backward :-("
Amazon,Only primary account?,Ashlee Johnson,17-Jul-16,1,"Not a fan of this, unlike other Amazon services this only works with the primary account holder. My secondary account can't listen, everything else is seamless and works great, this service needs work."
Amazon,Just Load Already!!!!-,kitty,29-Mar-16,1,I would so love to give is app five stars because I love the music selection. However I have use the app three time and now I can't even get it to open. I think this app has a lot of promise but there are just to many problems.
Amazon,"Neat, but dissapointing",Yost,2-Aug-11,1,"Streaming from your cloud drive is very cool, and seems to work quickly over 3G connections. Unfortunately downloading from the cloud player to the local memory was non-functional. App only downloads to internal memory, and the media playing portion only plays media on external memory. Call to Amazon support only netted the advice: ""try calling your carrier"". Surprisingly enough Verizon doesn't employ anyone with an expertise in software written by Amazon, so I have a half-functional app. I supposed that would be worth 2.5 stars if it weren't for the support calls literally laughing me off the call."
Amazon,Android mobile screen does not rotate... Also No Fire TV???,Home Theater Boy,12-Sep-14,3,"The music selection is solid.  It streams quite well on my Razr Maxx.My two issues are:#1 - The screen does not rotate when the phone is rotated.  You end up seeing everthing sideways vs. having a proper, easy to use landscape view.#2 - Fire TV - Does not work on Fire TV???  That's just a head scratcher.  Is there an ETA for this?"
Amazon,Worst app ever,Nancy Jazrawi,28-Feb-17,1,Worst app ever. 95% never works. I am a prime member and the quality of Amazon is just degraded over time. This is hotribe service.
Amazon,Trumped By Spotify Premium,Brad Dessy,3-Feb-16,1,"Was really hoping for more. The platform is a bit clunky to navigate through, the selection of music is limited, and its compatibility with outside apps like HEOS isn't good either. Will likely be switching back to Spotify premium shortly"
Amazon,One Star,scott gillies,23-Jul-17,1,No good
Amazon,I hate match,Rich,1-Aug-12,1,"I subscribed to iTunes Match when it first came out and hated it because many of the songs that I have are the mono versions. iTunes match would match these tracks and give me the stereo version. There was no way to get around it. Then I paid for Amazon's mp3 cloud service. They didn't have an app for my iTouch but at least I could play the exact same tracks that I uploaded. When the Amazon app for the iTouch and iPhone came out, I was very happy because it worked well and it was easy to play all of the music that I uploaded. Now with this latest update to Amazon's cloud service, it's just like I'm back using iTunes match. A number of my mono tracks have been matched by Amazon and I'm getting the stereo version. I understand why match is available and get why it's a great tool but there really needs to be a way to bypass the match feature so people can listen to the exact mp3 they want to hear, not the one Amazon decides you should listen to. Some of the other tracks I've uploaded come from audiophile releases that sound much better than the ones offered by Amazon. So in these cases, I'm losing sound quality. Please, give us the option to shut off match if we don't want it."
Amazon,Says not compatible,Mr Arthur Castorina,23-Apr-16,1,"I have a kindle fire HD and suddenly the app doesn't load, says not compatible with device. Each time I tap the app a circle just spins. I tried downloading from store and it says not compatible with my device ???????"
Amazon,Awesome music app!,Dan Van,4-Apr-11,5,"This was always a great way to buy MP3s. Now the Cloud Player makes it a fantastic app. It was an easy process to upload all my music from both iTunes and WMP.  All the playlists are intact. And the interface is clear and easy to use.I've had no problems with buffering,  even driving through mountains with weak and intermittent 3G signals. This app must buffer far ahead.Overall, a great way to seamlessly play your music anywhere!"
Amazon,Seems shady to me,Cassandra,6-Feb-17,1,I'm being charged 2.99 per month for I don't know how long for something I never signed up for. I can't even figure out where or how to end the subscription.
Amazon,AWESOME!,CThrasher,19-Sep-15,5,"I love this! I can listen to all different kinds of music, playlists, and stations. The stations are listed as artists and they play music similar to those artists. You can like/dislike certain songs and it automatically adjusts the station to suit what you like. This is awesome!!

Prime Music is pure garbage..."
Amazon,No gapless playback,Aloysius the Beautiful,4-Oct-13,4,"The product is great. I just wish it had gapless playback. For example, in the transition from the song ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" to ""With a Little Help From My Friends"", there should be no pause. The same could be said for any medley-style music where the components of the medley are separate tracks. Isn't there any way to pre-load the first few seconds of the next song into memory while the current one is playing?"
Amazon,Terrible compared to Google Play,Victor Breaux,30-Apr-15,1,Terrible compared to Google Play. Terrible compared to anything really. I've tried to use it on my galaxy s5 over the last cpl of months and its been the worst experience ever with a music app. Uninstalling and going back to google until a third party developer creates a working app for prime music.
Amazon,Love,Jean Brandt,4-Mar-17,5,Mine is free with my Amazon Prime subscription. ! Love it
Amazon,Disappointing,Brittany,23-Jul-14,2,"I was so excited when Amazon rolled out Prime Music.  Not so excited anymore.  I can only play Prime Music from my computer and sometimes even that doesn't work.  I have this app on my phone and it shows it up to date, but can only access some of the songs I've purchased and nothing from Prime Music.  To top it off the app isn't even available on my Kindle Fire."
Amazon,Annoyed with new versions.,Michael,17-Aug-14,3,"What was wrong with the previous versions? This includes the Android version also. With previous versions, the second I purchased an album/song, it was immediately downloaded automatically. Now I have to navigate all these windows, tabs and whatnot to force it to download to my computer.I hope this gets fixed soon, I might go with Google Music."

The kicker, mostly all my lost music were my best albums.  I worked with digital mp3 services for weeks now, still no resolution AND NO REFUNDS ALLOWED!!!  I believe the s Sun is settling on amazon kindle music.I would go with ipad most definitely.  Your choice.  Enough said."
Amazon,Music dissapears.,Amazon Customer,29-Dec-15,1,This app is preinstalled on my fire tablet. Given the choice I would steer clear. All music from my offline library keeps disappearing only to come back hours later and disappear again. Also the app keeps forcing closed. This app is crap.
Amazon,Update:  you can download to sd card now!,T. Burgett,14-Sep-15,5,"First I hated it because you couldn't download to sd card.  This was crucial if you have a phone with only 8 or 16 GB of memory. Now that you can, its amazing.  Love that my phone company includes them in my free data plan!  Couldn't be happier!  Thank you Amazon!"
Amazon,"Worked ok with t-mobile G2, but can't uninstall",Johnny,20-Jul-11,2,"This app often worked well, but I had issues with buffering, even over my 4g network. That was unacceptable. So I decided to uninstall. No matter what I did, the icon kept popping up, even after supposedly removing it. And it would still run. Nothing I did worked to remove it. This is unacceptable, and I am not happy at all with this app. I should be the one deciding whether I want this app on my device or not, not Amazon."
Amazon,Does not work with New Android update,Amazon Customer,12-Apr-16,1,Please fix so it can play nice with Google's latest Android on Nexus 6p
Amazon,Love love love Amazon Music!,Raider Mom,18-Jun-16,5,I love love love this feature. Any music I want commercial free. Includes kids stations and free skipping. I find it easier to navigate than the other music streaming apps and without annoying commercials and other interruptions.
Amazon,this app is next to useless.,Skipp,16-May-15,1,"With no way to put the music on an external SD card, this app is next to useless."
Amazon,Yet another iTunes,cmarnold,20-Jul-14,1,"Oh...just like iTunes...desktop version only available for Windows and MacOS.  Additionally, it's been hampered by the fact that you can't download all of your digital rips at once if you don't use Windows or MacOS.  Linux users must click, download, unclick, new click EVERY song.  This is why I still purchase physical media - I can manage it better myself."
Amazon,I hate it,Chris Davison,31-Oct-14,1,S***ty app. I just want to purchase/download music. The player sucks and everything is poorly organized. I cannot search specifically for purchased music to download to my phone. It attempts to read all internal memory music and mixes it with streamable Prime playlists and music they want you to buy. Frustrating as hell to navigate.
Amazon,APP SUCKS!,Terry Flinn,2-Mar-17,1,Can't use on my Kindle - worthless app!
Amazon,Fine...except for Bluetooth,Amazon Customer,17-Jun-14,2,"I loved the Amazon MP3 app.  Since I've updated to this, my Bluetooth headset won't work with the app while the screen's off.

Amazon,And the on-line help is useless. Wish I had stayed with iTunes,AlbertR,9-Dec-16,1,I find it quite difficult to navigate this application.  It often crashes on my Mac.  And the on-line help is useless.  Wish I had stayed with iTunes.

Amazon,More time spent loading than playing.,Fredy,13-Jul-16,1,"If you're playing music and you decided to pause it, you'll have to go back into the app rather than just pressing play from the lock screen. App runs really slow on a brand new Note 5."

Amazon,Ate my data like crazy!,Jessica,17-Jul-14,2,"I used it on my android phone and was loving it, unfortunately I had to uninstall it b/c it was eating up my data like crazy. I downloaded everything to my device and would even disable my data when in use. Once I was done I would have to force stop the app periodically and it still consumed gbs of data. Not sure if this is a phone issue or app issue???"
Amazon,"Amazon music should be called, ""We hate our customers"" or ""Stand still while we stick you in the eye""",Scott Olson,15-Nov-14,1,"Why doesn't Amazon just write an app that sticks a flaming hot rod up my back end when I try to give them money? I tried to buy music with this app, but it wasn't successful. Why make it so painful buy something? What if every store on the planet made you install a non-functioning app on you computer just to make a purchase?"
Amazon,LOUSY,April,1-Jan-13,2,I'm so angry!! The cloud player gives you incomplete albums and then I had to manually go and fix thousands of songs that were missing. It also shuts down while I'm in the middle of playing my music. It also freezes up!! This is not what I payed for! I've had to uninstall and re-install a bunch of times already. This app could have been good but it really needs ALOT OF WORK!! I spent to many days trying to correct what the cloud player was SUPPOSED to do. Really agravated.

Amazon,Not Working At All,Sabrina K.,24-Jan-17,1,I've had the app before and it worked amazing. Now with the new updates the screen just goes to white when it's opened and won't do anything.
Amazon,Amazon music apps,HYPER1090T,15-Aug-15,2,"Not just this app, but all the Amazon music apps on all the various formats I use leave much to be desired.

Amazon,Can't see Prime playlists,Mom of 4,30-Aug-14,1,(This review is for the Android app.) The reason I wanted this app was to be able to play Prime playlists from my phone. The only music it can see is the music that I've actually purchased. The Prime playlists don't show up anywhere in the app.
Amazon,It has issues!,Amazon Customer,8-Jan-15,2,"I purchased a song, my credit card was billed however nowhere in the cloud can I find the song. I have looked and looked and even did a search and it doesn't even show that I have that song and if I look in my Amazon orders it doesn't show it however I got an email and was billed, for it where is my song!!!!"

It loads and starts OK, but when trying to play any Prime Music the app will pop a dialog indicating there is a problem with my Credit Card (there is not). Prime music (which is GREAT!) runs fine with my Kindle Fire and PC, but just not with this app."
Amazon,I have had poor experiences with all Amazon Music apps,Robin,18-Mar-16,1,No expert here; but I cannot get AM to work on my Motorola Moto 3 which has the latest android OS.  I have had poor experiences with all Amazon Music apps.  The website is mostly easy for downloading music.
Amazon,LAST UPDATE,Stacy Ewing,22-Dec-13,1,You updated it a week ago and it hasn't worked since put it back! Put it back! Put it back!! Put it back! There's your $20 damn words.
Amazon,Useless. A waste of time,Amazon Customer,23-Aug-16,1,Useless. A waste of time. Difficult to use; over-complicated and everytime I try to listen I'm taken to a page in French. Life is too short to bother with this rubbish.
Amazon,Good and logical organization with a wide variety of musical ...,Samuel W. Lindsey,9-Sep-15,5,"Good and logical organization with a wide variety of musical choices for the Prime member. Could use a little less technicality when organizing music on the ""cloud"" drive, ie. Double listings of artists who collaborate with other artists instead of just listing the album information. Love the option of seeing the lyrics (wish it provided it with every song)! More than comparable with Windows Media Player. It would be awesome to see it offer ""visualizations"" in the future..."
Amazon,Bummer,Shopping gal,27-Nov-16,1,Pretty disappointed that I cannot purchase music using the app on an iPhone 7.
Amazon,Works great with Apple iPhone,Non Vine &amp; non paid reviewer,23-Sep-16,1,Works great with Apple iPhone. Access virtually millions and millions and millions of songs!I mean virtually because in reality you can't play anything:(
Amazon,Absolutely terrible.,Nick Voyvodich,15-Aug-14,1,"This is absolutely terrible. It is unnecessarily complicated and takes much more time as if you were to download it. Getting music from amazon was so much better when it just downloaded your song straight to your computer, without having to go through a horrendous app such as this. I will not be using this to download anything ever again."
Amazon,Five Stars,nick laney,14-Oct-16,5,App works great
Amazon,Delete option tragic,SuziQ6463,4-May-11,1,"I have this app and was very satisfied until I discovered that when I created a playlist on my music player, that I had duplicated some of the songs, so I proceeded to delete the songs that were duuplicated in that particular playlist and unknowingly deleted the song from my phone completely.  I checked my memory card and every place on my phone that I thought I may retrieve it from to no avail.  I was very upset to say the least. I spent over $15.00 on those downloads and now I have them no longer and can not retrieve them from the amazon.com web page as there was not save to your computer option when ordering by my phone thru the amazon.com mp3 app.  I implore Amazon to correct this issue and at least have a notification worked into the program that will put up a note asking if you are sure that you want to delete this song, as it will no longer be available.  This is the only fair thing to do, anything else, leaves the customer to have to re-purchase the song download.  I look forward to Amazon making this change very soon and until then I will be making my purchases else where."
Amazon,AMAZON PRIME AND AMAZON PRIME MUSIC IS TOTALLY AWESOME!

Amazon,Not very happy with this one lately,MaHettie Cornman,17-Jul-16,1,"Not very happy with this one lately. Once again, it's all because of my location. We have alot less data connection than people within the lower 48 and that gets frustrating... which I know isn't this company's fault. I just don't know what to think or belive about it anymore."
Amazon,Why???,Pandora F.,25-Apr-16,1,"I loved it and then it started draining my battery  (cut the time it stays charged in half) and now, three days after downloading 1999 and Pink Palms, it's stopped working. WTH, Amazon.com."
Amazon,So close,Agent Michael Scarn,30-Mar-11,4,"Having only played around with the new music player a little, I've been generally impressed. A couple tweaks and this would be my new default player. My biggest gripe is the lack of control from the lock screen. It takes way too many presses to skip a song- especially while driving. I wish holding the next/previous buttons would fast forward /rewind. My last complaint is needlessly specific, but I wish the widget showed cover art. The whole interface could be more exciting, but I don't mind the simplicity. The ability to store in the cloud is amazing, and it works great. That said, until I feel comfortable using it as my primary player, I won't have much use for it. I'm hoping amazon updates soon with the must-haves (and wouldn't hate to see the superficial stuff addressed either) Great start to what must be the future of how we listen to music!"
Amazon,Wouldn't download to my Kindle. I am not the ...,Amazon Customer,25-Jul-16,1,"Wouldn't download to my Kindle. I am not the most tech savy person, but you would think that an Amazon Prime app would load onto an Amazon Kindle without tech support."

(Is this is a bug?)- Stream pausing during calls (The volume seems to have issues getting back to normal after a call stops ringing?)- Stream quality is questionable at times- No app volume control (I have to increase the master volume on the phone to get the output louder on the music which in turn made every other sound on the phone loud)"

Amazon,Very Unhappy!,Angela C.,22-May-15,1,"This app was doing great until just recently. I was able to upload music from other sources such as iTunes and just use it as my main music app. All of the sudden it won't play those uploaded songs without being connected to a wifi network.

Amazon,Useless Bloatware,Ian C. Muir,16-Dec-12,1,"This app is completely useless. It can't be uninstalled from my phone and it's constantly taking up system resources even though I don't use it. Somehow, Amazon made a mobile app that's worse than the stupid desktop mp3 downloader.I still can't fathom why every company that sells music needs to have their own stupid player. I guess their marketing folks are happy to lose users just to get more stalking info and push their products harder."
Amazon,Cloud player= Best thing to happen to music in a long time,C. Dawson,2-Apr-11,5,"Amazon has earned my respect with this app. This isn't the old amazon mp3 player which wasn't bad but nothin special just like itunes with cheaper albums most of the time, but now this is the future of music in my honest opinion. The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long. Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore. Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service. Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer. So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe. See even if you music device fails you instantly have all your music back.Thanks for making something we always needed."
Amazon,"CloudPlayer is great, but the Amazon MP3 app is still buggy!",E. White,3-Apr-11,3,"While the CloudPlayer is awesome, and I'm glad someone finally did it, the app itself still needs some work.  Right now, it does not seem to be capable of completely smooth streaming over a mobile connection (and Wi-Fi, some say).  Even more maddeningly, the app displays unpredictable behavior in the face of sound alerts on my Motorola Droid 1...playback will stop and not resume (with on-phone MP3s) or start randomly after an audio alert.  Fix these two issues, and it'd be a five-star app.Otherwise, Amazon did a fantastic job with the CloudPlayer!"
Amazon,"Fine, if you don't want to read the news while listening to music.",Amazon Customer,4-Feb-17,1,Completely worthless Android implementation. The app will not continue playing in the background after opening another app.
Amazon,"BIG fan of the idea, but it needs some reworking/rethought - MY SUGGESTIONS",M. Rodenhauser,4-Apr-11,3,"I love the concept of a cloud drive, especially from my preferred vendor of MP3s, however the player/store needs a reworking. There are some performance issues which I'm sure they're working on since this is the initial launch, however my real gripes are with their overall approach to playing music from a their own remote source.Why must shopping/playing from cloud/playing locally feel like three completely separate tasks in one app? Instead of trying to jam two apps into one, and still giving the user that segregated feeling, give this app some synergy! I know that's pretty lame buzzword, but listen...The concept is simple at the high level:The user's list of tracks should be unification of what is online only, and what they have locally... NOT two separate lists. I'd like to see indicators of a track's source, but I should be able to make a playlist (or at least a track selection) that pulls from BOTH sources. This would actually save their bandwidth to pull from local storage whenever possible. Keep the ability to switch to ""offline"" mode, but it should not be the default, and it should NOT feel like a separate app/task/list. Much better user experience.On top of that, Amazon could sell much more music through the player by giving us the ability to sample music similar to our own library, or what we just listened to. They've got their ""similar customers"" logic down pretty good, why not put it right in the player? Don't force it on us, but offer it. As much flack as Apple gets for it's ""Genius"" lists, that stuff sells a lot of music. I would think this would be easy for Amazon.My last suggestion may be a pipe dream but for Android 2.2+ users, Amazon really should tie into the Voice Actions events. When I say ""Listen to Tool"" (or better yet, music I don't have) to my phone, the only apps on my phone that support that action are Pandora and Last.fm... Why not Amazon? If it's something I have, play it! If not, give me samples with the ability to quickly purchase. I think that could be a HUGE driver of sales.THINK ABOUT IT DEVELOPERS, THINK ABOUT IT!Lastly, as many other reviewers have said, app functionality dedicated solely to browsing for mp3's should be separate... or built into one of your other shopping apps, not into the player. I know you think that's gonna help sell music, but now I have to click extra times to get to the market because I normally use this app as a player, so I normally just wait till I'm at a computer, and sometimes I forget what I wanted to look for. Not an optimal experience for the user (or the salesman)!"

Amazon,My Music Where and When I Want It,S.L. Warne,27-Aug-16,5,"I like the many choices that Prime Music gives me. The choices of the different types and decades of music seems to be limitless, from inspirational to punk!

Throw in the fact that you can store and play your music, when you're not connected to the Internet, and you have the perfect, prime music download."

Amazon,A few suggestions,Courtney Koehn,10-Aug-17,3,"So I understand the need to take things in and out of the Prime Music library. Fine. But instead of making me remove EACH ALBUM that has been taken off Prime one at a time, can you make a REMOVE ALL button that takes away all albums that have been taken off Prime? I don't want them cluttering up my library.Also, it would be great if I could ""subscribe"" to an Artist so that any new albums by an artist are automatically added to my library.

Now offered as a part of Amazon Prime membership, you have no reason to not give this service a try.

Amazon,Love Amazon but the Apps for Android and Roku Need a LOT of Work.,Amazon Customer,11-Jan-15,1,Prime Music Streaming is unusable on my Galaxy Note 10.1 and there's no Prime app for the Roku.

Amazon,... app is ok however relying on flash player is stupid I think I'll be cancelling my prime,Jason W.,25-Sep-17,1,Your app is ok however relying on flash player is stupid I think I'll be cancelling my prime membership
Amazon,One Star,Amazon Customer,19-Feb-17,1,Absolutely ridiculous that I can no longer use it because it's now only available for android products.
Amazon,Five Stars,Amazon Customer,24-Jun-16,5,Love this App!!!
Amazon,Best on Android,Nocturnys,26-Mar-11,5,"This is absolutely the best mp3 app out there. The search function has never let me down in over 500 searches & downloads. The only critiques I have are that the app needs to include a Current list of top 50 for each category, in addition to aggregating compilation albums so they are listed as a single album after downloading instead of around 15 separate albums. Makes it kind of annoying when I want to listen to a soundtrack, and have to create a playlist to do so because the songs are not grouped together under one album."
Amazon,Perfect if you have Amazon Echo,fatgotti,10-Jul-17,3,Great music service that is getting better and better but still has some ground to cover to catch up to a few others. But the plan if you have a echo is just amazing for the price
Amazon,One Star,Amazon Customer,7-Jul-17,1,"I can't use it because of my credit card,  but charged me with a dollar. What happened?"
Amazon,Back to sirius,Kindle Customer,29-Jul-15,2,"Android 5.0.1 has been out since April yet the amazon music app has not been.  As a result, songs skip and do not play smoothly.  Amazon assures me it will be done soon but will not offer an exact date.  Back to Sirius radio."
Amazon,Amazing Music to your taste,Joe,4-Apr-17,5,"Amazing selection of just about any music you want to listen to from hard rock , pop, soft easy listing music to the oldies, new age, jazz and classical it about covers all your liking."
Amazon,This updated app is crap on my phone (Galaxy S3),Anthony Davis,2-Jul-14,1,"I miss the old MP3 player.  This updated app is crap on my phone (Galaxy S3).  It freezes all the time, has a delayed response when I try to do anything, and I'm also not a fan of the new layout.  Amazon MP3 Player was one of my favorite apps, but this new Music with Prime is total garbage in my opinion."
Amazon,Finally Useful!,J. Graves,3-Apr-11,5,"This app showed up on my Droid Incredible with the Froyo update.  I was furious!  I had never purchased a single song from Amazon, yet here's this app for them that I couldn't remove?  My opinion changed with the introduction of the Amazon Cloud Drive and Player.  I bought my first Amazon album to get the free $20 worth of storage space and started to upload all of my music to the Cloud.  Be patient.  It takes a long time (about 4 days, for me) to upload my songs.The app works just fine.  It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists.  The store portion is easy as well.  It even shows the free song of the day!  I haven't had any problems with playback, either.  My only suggestion to make this better is to have several widget options.  I want one that is full screen and displays the album art of the current song."
Amazon,Epic fail,Kat,20-Aug-16,1,Absolutely ridiculous that it is incompatible with Kindlefire. Why create an application that can't be used on your own device?
Amazon,only for peeps that like being led by the nose / told how to live by big brother,Hogans Hero,21-Jan-16,1,as much as i hate apple this app is worse than i tunes so thats where i am buying mp3's from now on no control over where i store music on my phone absolute big brother garbage
Amazon,that was pretty clever Amazon,Tekbunny,8-Aug-12,1,"so you're given unlimited space to upload all your music, they give you time to create a bunch of playlists then out of nowhere decide to charge you a sub fee or else they scrub most if it off of their servers. I guess all the music I continually and exclusively buy from their site isn't enough? its a shame too since I really enjoyed many features and ease of use of the program. oh well, be prepared to lose a lot of business I suppose."
Amazon,Latest version does not work on OS X,Tarquin,10-Jan-17,1,"This app no longer works on Mac OS X. All it does is say ""Amazon Music quit unexpectedly""."
Amazon,Works great in some ways,j66pecan,30-May-17,3,Works great in some ways.  The widget often doesn't work.  I wish it would find other music already downloaded on my phone and make it available to play through the app.
Amazon,absolutle terrible app. So many bugs and just doesnt work ...,Mrs W.,19-Nov-16,1,absolutle terrible app.  So many bugs and just doesnt work well at all and not user friendly whatsoever!!
Amazon,It plays my Amazon purchased music just fine. However,Chad Stewart,28-Aug-14,3,"It's a okay app. It plays my Amazon purchased music just fine. However, if Amazon would like more folks to purchase more music, through the service, they should add a rather basic feature; wish lists (in the app). It makes it easy to save artists and albums for possible future purchases."
Amazon,500 Song Limit on Playlists?,Michael A Candeloro,5-Nov-17,2,Why the 500 song limit on playlists? Without that limitation would give it a 4 or 5 star review.
Amazon,"amazon music sucks, dont bother",Christopher Deane,22-Feb-17,1,"crappy poor selection, waste of time, youtube owns you and is free.die amazon music!"
Amazon,Download location option very much needed,Xyloplax,26-Jan-15,1,No choice for download location in this day and age of major service providers offering 16GB only storage and many people having large external SD cards specifically for music? I now need to download it on my computer and move it manually? That's 1 star.
Amazon,Doesn't work with iphone 6s plus.,craftyone,6-Aug-16,1,"Not sure why, but I cannot access it from my new iPhone. I had an iPhone 5 and just upgraded to a 6splus and now it won't open."
Amazon,Today is the worst experience yet,abcdefg,26-Dec-14,1,Doesn't work - have been trying for half an hour.  Every time I buy music I have to update this ridiculous app and then spend hours trying to get it to work.  Today is the worst experience yet.  For shame.  I almost don't want to buy music from Amazon anymore.
Amazon,Does not work with 3 yr old HTC Desire,losttherace,16-Jun-14,2,"Useless. Although the app downloaded to my phone, the PC says my android won't work with it.  I can't access my library or find free mp3s on the android.  Nice try, but useless to me; I'll have to depend on the PC."
Amazon,"Decent, but consumes too much internal storage",Ed Grimley,16-Jul-12,2,"I've used the MP3 app since it was released. I now have about 90% of my music collection in Amazon Cloud. The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card. Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage."
Amazon,Amazing!!,Davidthomp,1-Apr-11,5,I love this player. Works great on 3g use it on the drive home to and from work with no problems. 20 gigs if you buy an album off of mp3 store how can you wrong. That is for a year and then 20 bucks a year after that. People spend more than that on coffee a month. Totally affordable! They have a customer from me. Do yourself a favor and download it now
Amazon,Battery sucker!!!!!,none,10-Mar-16,2,This app sucks battery power.  I've done a few tests where I ensure all other apps are closed and then run Amazon music. It drains 1% every minute. Ridiculous.
Amazon,"Really, Amazon?",Eric Tank,12-Sep-11,1,"Might be the greatest app in the history of the world - but I'll never know, since it won't play my Cloud-stored purchases from Amazon and won't update.  It just continually tells me there's  an update - which is at least one version back, it's saying 2.0.4 - but refuses to either open or update.  It just stays locked on ""Starting download"", without ACTUALLY downloading.  So I can't play the music I just bought.  Amazon, sometimes you really SUCK."
Amazon,Prime Music is rockin'!,DarbyKate,22-Jun-14,5,"I was so surprised to see such a wide variety of great music from all genres even a couple of my all time favorites that were a bit obscure. Prime is such a  great deal from Amazon...2 day shipping,  free video, TV and movie viewing for my tablet and tons of free music at my fingertips. I love it!"
Amazon,One Star,Down To Earth Person,17-Apr-17,1,I am not changing my device. Why only for Android?
Amazon,Crash Monster,Mary Ann Farley,1-Apr-12,1,"The cloud player crashes my phone constantly. Not only does app shut down during song, but  whole phone needs reboot.  Just awful. A mess."
Amazon,Not working on Samsung Note 10.1,Blake Christensen,15-Apr-15,1,Does not work on Samsung Note 10.1.Samsung's Milk app works great however.  As a Prime subscriber I would love to be able to use Prime Music.  Amazon needs to put a bit more effort in getting a working version for Android.
Amazon,Feeling like a redheaded step -child.,Sharon L Simms,15-Dec-15,1,"Wish I could write a review,but can't download the app to my WINDOWS phone. Not everyone has an android or apple phone. Get on with the times Amazon. Things, they are a changing."
Amazon,Continually Crashing,joanne,27-Jun-14,2,"I had the Amazon MP3 app on my Galaxy S4, it disappeared and has been replaced by this new app, I don't mind the change, the reason I only gave 2 stars is that it crashes just about every hour! Whether I am using the Cloud or my Device. It really is aggravating when working out! Fix this please!"
Amazon,App is Crap,edythe d  wagner,31-Dec-14,1,The app freezes after every song and needs to be restarted to get anything to play.  In new version time bar is gone from most songs and no ability to scroll backwards.  Sometimes the lyrics show and sometimes not.  Seems random. Lots of bugs to be fixed.
Amazon,AMAZON MUSIC WITH PRIME MUSIC,The Dragon Wind Ninja,17-Apr-16,5,I didn't know you now have a review to write for this I guess for everything now will need a rating  but if you have Amazon Prime  etc you know what you get it did buy some music from Amazon and am very happy  with my purchase 's
Amazon,Could improve. Can you make it to automatically launch ...,Sandopui,12-Oct-16,4,Could improve.Can you make it to automatically launch the last station listened when opening the app?
Amazon,Not Clear - Music Skips,Paul Blum,6-Aug-15,1,I have an HTC M One 8.  The music skips and is not clear.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I've spoken to Amazon several times but they tell me that I'm the only one in the world that has this problem.
Amazon,Too Buggy,drakesrob,1-Sep-14,1,"Honestly, I love amazon and when this app works, it is great. But currently I can only download to device 1 of my 10 playlists. Every other one crashes the app. It is a VERY buggy app. Amazon is trying, but in this case, unless you are lucky, it will not work as you want it too."
Amazon,Five Stars,Paul Kerr,20-Aug-17,5,LOVE IT
Amazon,I love this app,Vanessa H.,19-Aug-17,5,I love this app. It's really nice to be able to buy a song or album and have access to it in one place. Music sounds crisp and clear. Have been using Amazon music for years and love it.
Amazon,Connectivity through blutooth,Pete Hart,1-Feb-14,2,"I'm not sure if something happened during an update or if the settings on my phone (S4) need to be adjusted, but my problem with this app started about two months ago.I used to play music through my car's bluetooth seemlessly. Sink my bluetooth to my phone, open the app, play a song, music plays through my car's speakers. Easy as that. Now, when synched and attempting to play, I get no sound. The player is playing, as it shows the track progressing, but no sound is produced. Not through the car's speakers, the even through the phone.I've closed and reopened it, cleared the data which works, temporarily. But if I try to simply switch songs I'm back to nothing!Anyone else having these issues? Im getting sick of it."
Amazon,Never run out of options,Kyra Curtis,19-Jun-17,5,Very handy. You never know what you are in the mood for there is plenty to choose from.
Amazon,This Sucks,Mumbley,7-Dec-16,1,Been a member of Amazon almost forever and this sucks. Have Windows phone and am ignored.

Amazon,How about a windows phone app? Or a way ...,Jared,25-Nov-15,1,"How about a windows phone app?  Or a way to at least get the music I purchased onto my phone, unless there is a way to transfer the file license to my phone, it can't be done."
Amazon,Bad user experience since last update.,J83,29-Dec-16,2,Unfortunately the Android app pauses erroneously since the last update - annoying :(
Amazon,Gimmick to sell,CR,29-Sep-14,1,"Add the text for prime music indicates FREE but most of what I saw had a cost.  I spent about 30 minutes adding the free selections I found but never found a way to play them...uninstalled app.  This is just a gimmick, hoping you click on things that cost you money."
Amazon,"Okay, but. . .",TwinMomVA,25-Apr-16,3,If it didn't stop playing when the screen slept and if it would just play in the background. . . that'd be great. Switching screens to a different app stops play. That's unacceptable.
Amazon,LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!,tamjo333,10-Sep-12,5,"I LOVE the Amazon Cloud and MP3 app for my android! I have all of my pictures for the past 10 years backed up, and close to 4000 songs backed up and I can carry then EVERYWHERE with me.  This product is sooooo user friendly.  It only took 1 day to upload all of my music.  It was amazing! I never write reviews on products, but this app and the Amazon Cloud are sooo good I just had too! I highly recommend it!"
Amazon,So so frustrating!  Amazon get it right please!,Janine,28-Aug-14,2,"Extremely frustrating app.  Allows you to ""download"" music but for what purpose?  As soon as I get on the subway it gives me a network error and freezes. So what's the point of downloading as this music if you still can't listen to it unless your connected! !!!"
Amazon,Stutters when playing songs offline,Chase,13-Nov-15,2,"It's a great music app and all but what I noticed songs will start to randomly stutter when playing them offline. It's VERY annoying, I was hoping that this $50 amazon fire tablet would replace my old and slow ipod for music, but I guess it's back to my iPod :("
Amazon,"cloud player: good idea, needs tweaking",Patrick W. Deegan,6-Apr-11,4,"For the most part I like the player, but have one fix i'd like to see implemented:While Cloud access is limited to the US, the Android Player should not assess its location on Android system's ""Language & keyboard"" setting--in my case I use ""English (UK)"" even though I am in the US; this prevents the Cloud player from working on the MP3 app, which is silly; using an IP address or other location would enable playing and be more accurate."
Amazon,i am well pleased. i just bought a new pc & i ...,Karen R. Jones,12-Aug-16,5,i have bought several songs through this site. i am well pleased. i just bought a new pc & i need to download

Amazon,App Keeps Crashing.,Lee46,6-Apr-15,1,This app keeps crashing on my i-phone.  Very frustrating.  I must have downloaded and deleted it 3 times hoping it would stop crashing but to no avail.  Amazon should have made sure that the app works before releasing it!
Amazon,One Star,g,19-Nov-15,1,Consumes a lot of battery power even when it isn't used.
Amazon,Horrible,John & Carrie,15-Jul-15,1,"Terribly slow and buggy. Click on a song, and you wait for about 30 seconds for it to actually start playing. Try to add a song to playlist....some delay. Epic fail Amazon. I expect better from you."
Amazon,Works well but could use some upgrades,MJB_01,11-Oct-13,4,Upgrade one - Cannot find a way to add albums or songs to wish list when in the store.Upgrade two - There is no recently viewed from the store.Upgrade three - would like to send feedback or bugs from app.Otherwise it does what it is supposed to for the most part and works well with the Samsung phone I have.
Amazon,Wasted time trying to load,Jane,21-Jul-14,1,"Wasted time trying to load.  Had to set up a Google password, then open the little white shopping bag on phone etc, etc, and, in the end, after 30 minutes, still no download.  If you make an Amazon link for the free prime music, I'll try again, but I am through with Google."
Amazon,2 music apps that's sooooooooooo confusing !,constantine,24-Aug-14,3,"So confusing Amazon. The apps (yes 2) are great but it's the most confusing thing ever. One app is amazon music and one is amazon music prime ! our fire phones now have both so do our kindles because I thought you have to download the prime music app to have prime music......but you can download prime music from both apps ! they just don't sync from one another ! plus the prime app does not seem to play in either cat (subaru & ford) the original music app does ?!?!?!?!got it ?! nope......neither do I. why 2 apps ? the original music app has the prime in it so why make a second app and confuse people, like this review is doing !?!?!?!?!?!!??"
Amazon,Not Compatible with my first generation Kindle Fire.,Tamera L. Hutton,24-Jun-14,2,"I tried to download again because I read a review that it would work on my device, but when I go to purchase it still says not compatible with my device. What gives? I would think being a prime member and owning an Amazon product, they would make it available on the Kindle Fire."

Amazon,Rediscovering my love for music!,Kathleen A.,11-Aug-17,5,"As an Amazon Prime member I just discovered Amazon Music for my Android phone. It has been so much fun creating my playlists. An incredible abundance of music to choose as a part of my membership. I even found older music from my childhood that I didn't realize existed anymore. Love, love, love how easy it is to use and enjoy!"
Amazon,"Needs smart playlists, like apple",S. Berube,13-Apr-15,3,"This is really on the right start but needs two items fixed.1. Needs smart playlists, like apple, and google have2. Needs google now search integration so we can voice search and say 'play song ...'"

Amazon,I love that I can listen to uninterrupted music and forward ...,J Miller,25-Jun-17,5,I love that I can listen to uninterrupted music and forward past songs that I don't want to hear. Not having to listen to morning djays is a great way for me to start my day.
Amazon,Music to my ears! :-),genina929,28-Sep-16,5,Awesome selection! A lot for free! Nice sound! App is great!
Amazon,Great selection and awesome playlists,Jessica L. Eisnor,15-Jul-16,5,Amazon music has a wide array of songs and artists. The majority of albums or songs I have wanted were free with my Prime membership. There have been a few songs or albums I've had to purchase but they are pretty inexpensive.Another thing I really enjoy are the playlists they put together. They have something for everyone and everything...whether it's an 80's playlist or playlist for any mood your in. All in all I think Amazon music is terrific and well worth getting.
Amazon,Needs work,RPM,27-Jan-12,2,"I love having my music on the Cloud Drive, but almost every time I open the downloader I have to update the software. And the recent update of the downloader gave me the ""gift"" of a free song that I didn't want. I really didn't want it to be downloaded to my computer and had to remove it from my Cloud Drive before I could download songs I actually wanted to my computer. Please Amazon, don't force me to download music I don't want."
Amazon,Usablity/Free storage is less,rpv,16-Apr-13,3,"I have not purchased many mp3s from Amazon (may be < 50), but once i buy I transfer to computer and store in my cache. All my 10,000+ songs/podcasts are in Google Music and I stream from there. I prefer a local cache, and store in my 64GB microSD as well.Amazon does not give too much free storage, hence my decision not to use it on a daily basis."
Amazon,prime clloud play,Richard Smith,24-Jul-14,3,Downloading is the way of the new mp3 cloud player. Digital files Are the way of the future. Cds and DVDs  will soon be obsoleteI love it.

Amazon,Amazon music has an amazing library!,nancy ann walters,5-Jun-17,5,I was surprised at how many songs were available. And the songs are clear on my Amazon fire tablet. Setting up personal library is easy too
Amazon,The First to the Cloud,Amazon Customer,29-Mar-11,5,"The app was just fine before, however the update allowing cloud storage was a game changer. With all the tech giants racing to get there first it was Amazon who quietly won. The app works great. Even on 3g it streams very well. At least I had no problems (Epic 4g). Google will always be my favorite company but Amazon with the launch of their app store and now cloud storage for all (and I mean all your music even your itunes can be uploaded) they are a very close second."
Amazon,Needs chromecast for all amazon prime items,anonymous,15-Apr-16,2,Need chromecast!!  Why can't I access my music library via a mobile web page to chromeast - it forces you to go to the music app.

Amazon,Not ready for prime time,Jens B. Fiederer,27-Aug-14,2,"This appears to be able to play items in my Cloud library, so it is not 100% useless.The first time I tried to use Prime Music, I selected a genre (I selected ""blues"" by accident) and actually got something to start playing.  Since then, I just get a big orange circle in the middle of the black screen (presumably some sort of ""waiting"" indicator).The search icon is functional, so I can also enter a search term and see that search term displayed between the menu icon and the search icon with the orange circle performing its animation below.  That is all I can do on my Samsung Galaxy S5 Active."

Opens up and crashes when its crashing and you can't stop it from taking over your phone when its crashed.  Amazon has a lot of work to do but it has potential.  Does not include prime stations like the desktop app.Tested on Nexus 5 T-Mobile Lollipop 5 all updates.

Amazon,One Star,Daniel e Lewis 2,10-Feb-17,1,Definitely not dependable hardly any selection can be found
Amazon,Horrible! No good music available,Laura Smith,28-Dec-15,1,Horrible! No good music available. You would think for $99 a year you could save any song to your cloud but no. Only the older music is available with your prime membership. Any of the new release songs you have to pay for.

Amazon,Great Music App,Ragtopper,14-Aug-17,4,"I have used several music streaming apps in the past.  Amazon music is one of the best, by far.  I am using the basic version, not unlimited.  The fact that there are no commercial interruptions is phenomenal.  I have even managed to convert my kids.  They like it as well.  The search tool works well.  The playlists they have compiled actually match the subject/genre.  Unlike other apps, where there always seemed to be random songs within the playlist that don't belong, each song fits.  The selection is huge, I have only found a few artists/albums that weren't available, or were limited to the unlimited version.  All in all it is a very good music app, and I highly recommend it."

Amazon,love amazon music store,Amazon Customer,14-Jun-11,4,"my only problem with this app is that it is sometimes inconsistent with the items shown daily on the front page of the store. the free song & the sale album should, in my opinion, always be there. a featured 69 cent song is a nice addition, but shouldn't replace either & the same goes for a featured $5 album. i don't use the cloud player from my phone often, but haven't had any problems yet. i love that my purchased songs from the site or the app go immediately to the cloud. way better to have this than some other cloud players i've tried, like the one that requires your computer at home to be on so you can listen from your phone while you're out... wtf?"

Amazon,Useless app,smok3r,12-Jul-14,1,Since Amazon Prime music can't be moved to the sdcard... amazon music in general and this app is useless to me. I'd even buy music prime doesn't offer but if i can't move prime music it's all useless. I'll get mp3's from somewhere else.
Amazon,PANDORA WANNABE AND FAIL,Nemo Domi,8-Oct-15,1,"It's too much trouble for Amazon to provide info about which mix/remix version they're playing? Sheesh. These things DO have specific titles y'know. I would even go so far as to imagine that to do so would likely promote mp3 sales, eh?! Call me grumpy but I like to be able to know *exactly* what I'm listening to. In fact, now that I think about it, NOT to give credit to the remix artist BUT to use his/her material is kinda freakin' rude, Amazon. Back to Pandora I go ... thanks anyway but no thanks."

Since it sees WIFI enabled when you tether it will periodically check for connectivity because it gives preference to WIFI over 3G/4G.

Amazon,Great App; One Critical Limitation,Samaurai8,25-Jan-13,2,The Amazon mp3 Cloud Player is fabulous but there is a critical limitation with this player. You can only store downloaded songs to internal storage. It seems to be impossible to store mp3s in the external SD card.I have researched this and there seems to be no way to change the download location unless you root the phone.

Amazon,Cheap and convenient music,Brian C. Macarthur,14-Apr-11,5,"I subscribe to multiple music services, and nothing really beats the cost of ownership and convenience of amazon mp3s and cloud storage. Internet radio is a great way to discover new music, but there's still no better be value for owning and now storing your music than amazon.On a side note, giving an android app one star because it doesn't work on a particular piece of hardware is like giving a movie a bad review because the projector failed. Android is fragmented, but the bugs usually get worked out.  The freedom that we enjoy with android carries some occasional inconvenience.Bottom line: this is a great app and service."

Amazon,Better than iTunes but needs ability to control download location.,RussellB,29-May-12,3,"I buy all of my music on Amazon and I like how my music is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere.  I use the Cloud Player to listen to music on my work computer.  I also like that I can choose what to download to my phone.  This app desperately needs the ability to change the download location.  I have a Droid Razr Maxx and on some newer Android devices sdcard/ refers to internal memory and sdcard-ext/ refers to the addon SD card.  AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard-ext/.  I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to, but this app has no option to do that.  Instead it downloads to the internal memory.  Amazon really needs to add the ability to change the download location of the music.  This one flaw mars an otherwise great app."

Amazon,Would give zero stars if possible.,Cat Gee Photography,29-May-12,1,"This is the slowest downloading program on the planet. It's taking literally a minute a song (on a 40 song album). I realize amazon probably wants people using the cloud storage and streaming for whatever dumb reason, but unfortunately for me i suppose, I want to actually have the music I paid for without having to log into a service to use it. Total BS imo.This is why people fileshare...five albums would have been done and moved onto my phone by now so I can leave, but instead I guess I'll be here another half an hour.Also, this downloader just sucks. It keeps popping up windows media player every time a) the current song it is struggling to download has finished and then b) when the new song being prepared to download actually starts to download. I can't minimize the program permanently to keep the window down, and I can't close it because it immediately restarts itself, so the other screens I'm looking at keep getting interrupted. Worst program ever. I have no idea why this ridiculous, buggy-acting, painfully slow app is necessary to get the files onto my computer. STUPID.Also it is taking up so much bandwidth to download (how is it going so slow then????!) that it takes forever for an internet page to load. sweet."

They updated my phone and it started working great at my house. I went out tonight with just my phone, switched on the exercise trainer and 3G data. It worked great until I got two blocks away from my house and stopped working. I couldn't get it to work again. I called my husband to put my iPod on his car tire so I could have some music to walk to. I was raving about it to two other friends who have EVOs but now I'm going to tell them not to even bother because it only works over WiFi. Completely useless for my needs. HTC EVO 4g"

Amazon,not compatible,Caasi,28-May-12,1,"I decided to download this app because Amazon was promoting $2 off select $5 albums if I download it with this app with my android device or Kindle Fire.

Amazon,Very cumbersome to use and the App is finicky at best.,Paul the Shopper,23-Oct-16,1,Music will not sync on Amazon Fire TV.  It would be ideal if music library mirrored iTunes.  Very cumbersome to use and the App is finicky at best.
Amazon,Amazing,Dan,31-Mar-11,5,Cheaper than itunes. Upload and download wherever you want. See ya itunes. I really don't know why people would buy DRM music on itunes for more money.

Amazon,"forever a ""network error""",J Ant,19-Dec-11,2,"Its always a ntwork error or ""error playing song"" on my htc incredible.  Though it works fine on our droid global 2."
Amazon,Needs Work,Bart,29-Mar-11,3,It's a very basic player.  Cannot create playlists that contain both cloud and local songs.  You can create either a cloud playlist or local playlist.  Works fine streaming music over wifi but get a network error when trying to play over 3g.  HTC EVO
Amazon,Excellent,SRF,27-Oct-11,5,This nicely complements the web version of Cloud Player.  It's convenient to have all of my music available anywhere on demand.
Amazon,i like it,C. McKinney,24-Sep-11,4,I wish I could move the play/pause buttons to top of screen. Integration with cloud drive is nice. I like this better than stock.

Amazon,Cannot listen without WiFi,TAHIR DUZYOL,29-Mar-11,4,App is great app. But I can't listen cloud music with 3G/4G. Cloud playing works only with WiFi on my HTC EVO. That's odd and needs to be fixed.
Amazon,Love it,chris branscum,5-Jul-11,5,Touchy at times but it's free and you can play music while not using space on your phone it's a must have
Amazon,Why do they update and make them stop working?,Anonymous,1-Mar-13,1,"I used to love using this app. It was quick, easy to use, and I could download songs anywhere......then they updated it......now i can't download anything unless I am connected to wifi, but in that case, why not just use my computer?

Amazon,Sick of it updating...,JJ,12-Feb-12,1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!  YOU WILL MAKE A MAJOR MISTAKE...  JUST CHECK ALL THE VERIZON DROID USERS THAT ARE FORCED TO CONSTANT;Y UPDATE THIS USELESS APP!If you are relly looking to use amazon from your handheld device, go to the website directly.DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.  IT CONSTANTLY ASKS FOR UPDATES THAT WILL EAT YOUR DATA LIMIT.  AGAIN, JUST GOOGLE VERIZON DRIOD COMPLAINTS AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT A LOW RATING THIS APP GETS...It eats bandwith and Verizon forces Driod users to have this with no delete function available.  There are constant weekly updates, which if you go over Verizon's monthly bandwith, will cost you big bucks for a useless app.If you want to purchase from Amazon, just go directly to their website and DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, unless you are in the mood to pay for higher data rates... TRUST ME, DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE IF YOU ARE A VERIZON CUSTOMER!"

Amazon,bloatware,founderbrn,12-Apr-11,1,Any software that I can't uninstall without rooting my phone is bad software (came as bloatware preinstalled on my intercept)... but what makes this really bad software is that it likes to pop up in my list of running programs when I've NEVER once even started the app!
Amazon,A trap!,R. Berryman,4-May-15,1,"I love Amazon Prime... for my computer.  But on my Android phone, it is a disaster.And I CAN'T DELETE it!I didn't even order or request it."

Amazon,Best of the current batch,C. Blankenship,18-Jun-11,5,"works as described on my DROID x. beware, if u don't have unlimited data, this app lives and dies on data.  it will easily eat 100MB of data every hour.  I do wish that it would buffer at least 30sec ahead for when my 3G is spotty."

Amazon,great!,Kris,27-May-11,5,"awesome cloud player, saves me room on my sd card and phone. takes awhile to recognize newly purchased albums but once it does it streams them flawlessly.  never once has it stopped due to lag or hangups. highly recommend!"

Amazon,I loved it!,Pen Name,21-Mar-12,5,"I went from the android to the iPhone, and this was one of my most used apps. I wish Apple could use it. Which makes no sense they can't, considering all music is downloaded to iTunes anyway."

Amazon,Not compatable with Sonos,Amazaholic,14-Oct-14,2,Can't listen to Amazon Music on my Sonos system. Also you can't download Amazon Music onto your computer to add to your Sonos library. Useless for me.

Amazon,Five Stars,clyd campbell,14-Aug-17,5,awesome!
Amazon,"A clunky, clumsy mess.",AcidFree,30-Mar-11,1,"Listener interface and functionality are primitive at best.  If you're just into uploading mass quantities of stuff and cramming it in the ""attic"" for safekeeping I guess it's okay, if pricey, but if you're hoping to actually use this thing to listen to music and customize your listening experirence, wait for something hopefully much, much better."
Amazon,Playback issues with HTC Incredible,T. Haskins,21-Apr-11,1,"Web version works great, but I get a constant error when I try to access my music via my HTC Incredible.  I've tried all the tips and hints in the help forums, and still no solution works.  Maddeningly frustrating."

Amazon,Let me get rid of it!,C. Moore,31-Mar-11,1,"This was preinstalled on my G2 and I can't uninstall. To add insult to injury, after I force close it, it likes to start up on its own whenever the phone changes state. So it eats memory and battery... not cool."

Amazon,Since when isn't this included in Prime Membership?,Katlyn,25-Jul-17,1,"Boyfriend just got a dot for his birthday. When we asked it to play music, it automatically asked him to start a free trial for amazon music. We pay for prime; it was definitely on the list when I signed up originally. Since when do I get things I am contractually paying for taken away?"

Amazon,Garbage.,SG,28-Aug-17,1,Why fix what isn't broken? I'm not paying extra for anything. Ask for more you're not getting it. I've got Kodi.
Amazon,I cant get the app,carlosepv,31-Mar-11,1,"I cant get the app because I am from Brazil, but in Amazon site I can buy the whole world. Illogical. Solve it fast Amazon, please, Google music is coming..."

Amazon,can not sign in my cloud service,Jinguo Gu,29-Mar-11,1,"can not sign in the cloud service on my android tablet using this app. Although wifi is on, it can't find the network connection. It is the same connection session I downloaded the app and write this comments. I can log in through PC."
Amazon,Can't uninstall!,Phillip S.,24-Apr-11,1,Application came installed on phone with no way to uninstall.  to meet 25 word minimum ... This suck this sucks this sucks this sucks this blows
Amazon,Never works,Michael C. Holland,14-Apr-11,1,Never works even with full 3g or with cable internet.  Always gives me a network error.  Don't get that at all.  Good idea if it worked.
Amazon,stupid restriction,Alexei M.,21-Apr-11,1,"why the f*** do you force the user to switch to English? leave the Ui in English if you can't translate it, but don't disable the app."
Amazon,Amazon Mp3 UK????,Errol Lanier,31-Mar-11,1,I can't get to my songs in the cloud because the app is fubard and thinks I'm in the UK. I live in LA. Please fix this.
Amazon,Inspirational Music,Rosa Barton,12-Jan-15,4,Interesting app.
Amazon,the disappearing app.,Amazon Customer,27-May-11,1,apparently not yet available for my x10 mini pro. used to have it from the android market but it sadly disappeared.
Amazon,Locks up my atrix!,lu_santi,10-Aug-11,1,"After uploading about 5GB of music onto rhe cloud, i was anxious to use the droid app, however, after the first song plays it totally locks up the player rendering it useless unless i restart the phone again. It is a huge hassle and i hope it gets fixed in the next update."
Amazon,IMPROVED AND BETTER.,Raven Wilder,11-Nov-11,4,"I previously wrote a negative review years ago... But now? WOW! Prime Music has changed everything for me, and I'm happy to endorse this app and the service! I've deleted the old review and have totally changed my mind.My only complaint now is that this app is NOT compatible (or available) on Amazon Fire TV, and this just doesn't make sense! I can load Pandora and a dozen other music services on the Fire TV, but Amazon's own Prime Music service isn't available on their own hardware? WHY?!?  Amazon, PLEASE get with it and put this app on the Amazon Fire TV! I would definitely get a lot of use out of it!!!"
Amazon,cloud wins!,BeLogical,29-Mar-11,5,cloud storage = 5 stars!beat apple! cloud storage = 5 stars!beat apple! cloud storage = 5 stars!beat apple! cloud storage = 5 stars!beat apple!
Amazon,One Star,Deiby,22-Aug-17,1,Not a wide selection of Latin music
Amazon,Forces you to change android regional settings,G Williams,29-Mar-11,1,If you prefer to use a non us english dictionary then this app won't allow you to login to your amazon.com account! So am forced to update regional settings every time I launch the app.
Amazon,Not in Canada,Michael,29-Mar-11,1,"Let us download in Canada! Come on Amazon, this is lame. Just about ready to uninstall this app store if i can't install anything. At least let us filter by region so I can see what I can download in Canada."
Amazon,This is the worst...,Cora Palfy,23-May-11,1,"This downloading application has literally taken 5 hours to download ten songs.  There is no problem with my internet, I have the most recent version- it's just an awful application."
Amazon,Enjoy the station selections offering a nice mix.,mnrumohr,23-Jul-17,4,Good app and glad it is available with Prime.
Amazon,Keeps auto launching,Jerry,28-Sep-17,3,"Since the last update, the Android Amazon Music app keeps auto launching the player in my status bar.  I can't figure how to shut that feature off or stop that.  It just gets really annoying."
Amazon,"UPDATE:  FIXED (was ""A music player that can't play music.  Seriously?"")",RichFDrums,31-Mar-11,3,"UPDATE - ATTENTION EVO 4G USERS:  It turns out (after much online research today) that the issues I was experiencing were unique to the HTC Evo 4G, and were the result of a software update that had been pushed out to Evo users earlier this year.  Apparently this update had changed HTTP and RTSP streaming settings/configuration in a way that affected certain apps--in this case it rendered the Amazon cloud player completely useless.Interestingly, Pandora was somehow never affected by it, and so I hadn't noticed the problem until now.  Go figure.Anyway, the issue can easily be resolved by contacting Sprint Technical Support (1-888-211-4727) and asking the rep to apply the work around listed as 'HTC EVO 4G (A9292) - UPDATED 2-1-2011: Streaming multimedia applications receiving errors on software version 3.70.651.1' in Sprint's device portal.  I did this, and when I finally got to a tech support rep, he immediately knew what I was talking about, pushed an over-the-air fix, and 5 minutes later I was streaming from the Amazon mp3 cloud (over 3G) without any issues at all.It works perfectly now.  Sweet.  I'm upgrading my rating from 1 star (when I really meant 0) to 3 stars.---- previous review -----:This review is specific to the new ""cloud player"" functionality of the app.  Two words:  utterly useless.  I would honestly give it 0 stars if I could.I'm on an HTC Evo (Android 2.2).  Regardless of my connection--WiFi, 4G, 3G--I continually get the same ""Network Error"" when trying to play anything at all in the app.  It just doesn't work.  All other network-dependent apps on my device are working perfectly fine, while the Amazon MP3 player fails.I wouldn't even consider this alpha-quality software.  Did this thing even go through QA at all?"
Amazon,junk,Jay,28-Mar-11,1,"bloatware junk on my EVO soaks up memory, something like this should only run when you use it.don't get it, besides there are so many apps that don't run in the background out in the world that you can listen to or download music from."
Amazon,love it,YankeeM,22-May-11,5,love it hands down. being able to have my music anywhere without eating up space on my sd card. also not having to fumble with syncing with the pc is a plus
Amazon,Can't download what I purchased previously,Brandon E. Barker,26-Mar-11,1,This is a big enough problem to cause the application to have a one star rating; Amazon should be able to fix such an issue. Look to google music to rescue us.
Amazon,works great on my lg optimus,DJ,14-May-11,5,I love this app. It works exactly like it should. It's easy to buy music and to download songs from the cloud drive to my phone. It's also fast and there's like zero load time at all. Once I get all my music on the cloud drive I'll probably use this more than my iPod.
Amazon,Forced to have this program,Daniel R Colestock,2-Jun-11,1,This program came instalked by default on my evo 4g with no way to remove it.  At least give us a way to remove it so the people who don't want it can take it off.  What is the point in not giving us a remove option?
Amazon,Amazon Music Could Be Better,Mr. Ng,15-Jun-17,3,"I do like the app, however, it has a major glitch which is really annoying.  The app requires an Internet connection to play your music even it is already downloaded to your device.  How it comes?  This is a simple function that can be controlled in the code."
Amazon,Quite redundant,PenName,25-May-17,1,This app is awkward and a total nuisance. And it will not upload to my LG Stylus 2 which is a brand new phone I just got from Stream Mobile. All other Amazon Apps work but this one! Bring back the original app please.
Amazon,Amazon MP3 hindered my 911 call for emergency help,jbru,16-Apr-12,1,"I would give this application 0 stars if that were possible.  It came with my Sprint phone and presumably Amazon paid Sprint so that customers couldn't remove the application.That's fine, I just never used it.  I never bought anything, I never browsed anything, I never even opened the application.Of course, that didn't stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when I was trying to do other things with the phone.  It also had a fun little feature (re: bug) where it would use 100% of the phone's processor for minutes on end.  I say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone.  I would, randomly throughout the week, find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power.Again, mind you, I had never opened or used the application.I endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience, I was busy and it wasn't *that* big of an inconvenience.Then then time came when I was driving and tragically, a car in front of me struck a pedestrian.  I pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg (it looked like his leg had nearly come off), scrapes, contusions, broken teeth, and most likely a nasty concussion.  The people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out.  They stood around looking panic'd without a sense of direction.  I got out of my car and dialed 911, spotted a street address posted on a nearby building, and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was.Meanwhile, my phone stalled and I waited, and waited, and waited.  For 2 minutes and 14 seconds I waited for my phone to call 911 while I slowly started to freak out thinking I wasn't going to be able to get help for this kid.In the end I did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel, get advised on what to do for the kid, and made sure that the people freaking out didn't move him (neck injuries people, neck injuries).But for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying ""I just want to go home"" over and over again.Later, after I got off the phone with emergency personnel, I looked in my phone's task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call.  As it turns there happened to be an application that I had never used that was, for reasons unknown, using 100% of the phone's processing power.Tell me, readers, which application do you suppose that was?  Go on, guess.Now some of you will say that I should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app.  I know right?  Some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings, voiding my warranty, so that I could call emergency services in a timely fashion.Amazon MP3 was forced on me.  I have never used Amazon MP3.  I WILL NEVER use Amazon MP3 after that."
Amazon,_ÙÔ,Sarah Yopp,4-Jul-17,4,"There r several artists & songs on here that I haven't found on other music apps..the only issue I have is when I touch the 3-dot menu button on the rt side of the song to set it as the next song played,it changes to that song & interrupts the song already playing"
Amazon,No support for Boost's Motorola i1 running Android 1.5,Todd A. Jacobs,30-Mar-11,1,"Since Boost Mobile only supports a single Android phone at this time, the inability to run apps on a platform that Amazon says they support is inexcusable."
Amazon,"Once was good, now is bad!!!",amy,14-Jun-17,1,"I was considering upgrading, but now, no way. For some reason the app will play some songs and not others on my play list. I contacted support and all they could suggest was reinstalling the app, which I did with no result.  Even off line my play list will only play some of my songs, but not others that it once played. Very DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!"
Amazon,when will it open to people outside the states?,Leung Hoi Tung,23-Mar-11,1,"people outside the states can buy books, cd, but no mp3, why? i hope this app will soon be available to non american music lover like me."
