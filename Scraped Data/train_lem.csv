1,"Amazon",2016-03-28,5,"I like it good than Pandora. love this music app. great selection. good than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone. Not happy however that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App Amazon if someone can contact me about this would greatly appreciate The Amazon Cloud app do not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app..... thank!"
2,"Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it be just not worth payhing a year in advance for it. lot of product but I just do not use it enough to justify spend over a dollar 100 dollar a year on this. Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can not pay monthly which suck. Maybe if they start charge monthly I would sign up again. The free 2 day ship on product be goo think. But I never watch a movie or listen to a song on Amazon."
4,"Amazon",2016-04-27,4,"Glad to be able to get the music a a Prime member Love that you can download music a a Amazon Prime Member. Just be a little confuse for me when it ask certain question on where to store song and also if there be a charge for the song. That be the only reason I do 4 star. I be not quite a tech savy a some of the young people so just would have like a little much explanation. Love have the music though."
11,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Not bad consider its free! Decent service. Love the fact that it be bundle with Prime. make prime a even great bargain! The service itself be.... useable... The music selection be not a vast a other service and the audio quality for some reason be only so so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline that be must have for any music stream service. Hopefully artist and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscriber but I would not mind pay a extra few buck a month if the issue note above be address."

106,"Amazon",2014-07-03,1,"I know you be not listen BUT For all of us that have be use Amazon MP3 since the first Android device come out this be a major disappointment. First you snub us with instant video then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality. This after we have already spend significant money buy music from you. Sure i can switch to a new service but i really have no plan too before this and really do not want to spend the time. Its hard to understand what your issue be with Android i be positive that you can develop whatever you want. I wish you would have never show up on Android that way I can have build a library on another service to begin with. Very disappoint. Will have to use the pre install version until i can switch my wife and i to something else. Who would have guess a pre install app would come in handy. Good luck with your new fire product. look like i will be buy stock in the first amazon alternative that come along cause this alienation of such a large customer base make no business since whatsoever. You be try to crush Google but push people to them. You can have own the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and app."

I can not really review any other feature of the app because my music be not accessible. I call Amazon and be tell they be work on it. A couple of day late there be a update which do not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the feature it want but if I cannot play the music I already own the app be useless to me."
118,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"It should be free to download Some song to download you have to buy so again whats the point of be a prime member? Amazon be try to squeeze every cent out of us."

Whether I be home or not on wifi or 4G. Still keep stop mid song to either load or the app just crash altogether. It have potential but I be disappoint I have to go back to Pandora."
137,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"bad update ever!!! This be a force update that if you uninstall it it remove your amazon app completely. I lose all of my playlists and there be a lot much step to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menu and too may ad. And I do not know if this have anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen have change and now I have multiple page to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
142,"Amazon",2015-03-30,1,"I should have know Amazon Prime Music / Kindle / Video be too good to be true I should have know Amazon Prime Music / Kindle / Video be too good to be true! Like Netflix RedBox and any of the other like it there be always loophole / limitation. Every movie song book I have try to download it be not include in the Prime package. I can just a easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same apply to music / video. look like the only thing that I be go to benefit from by purchase Prime be the free ship for my Christmas shop."

I contact Amazon customer Service and ask them about play music through Prime Music outside the US. They tell me that I must have a credit card issue in the USA in my Amazon account to be able to listen to Prime Music even when not in the US.

212,"Amazon",2016-12-29,1,"late update suck! It be nice have a large selection of free music with my Prime membership but late update seem to have take a lot of that away. a if the Prime membership fee be not enough you now want me to pay a subscription to listen to music that be once inluded with Prime!

240,"Amazon",2015-01-02,1,"Completely Useless Randomly stop stream. Way good option to stream music. The absolute bad stream music app I have ever use. It constantly stop stream regardless of the device I be use to listen to music. This happen on any network when I attempt to use the device. It even stop on my Kindle. You would think it if be go to work the good option would be on the Kindle but no. I have no problem with Spotify or Pandora ever stop. If I be not a Prime member there be no way I would ever use this completely useless service."
241,"Amazon",2017-01-07,5,"Five star okay"
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App need some improvement. I use this app all the time. Unfortunately it can not be use safely while drive. On my Kia optimum it will not change song by push the up or down on the steer wheel. A voice command / Alexa style function would be nice for search for song while drive."

It now either freeze crash or freeze and crash every time I try to play any of the Prime Music song. The song in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially Prime music have add zero song for my enjoyment and the app upgrade have break the app. good play!"
265,"Amazon",2016-02-04,1,"What a waste of a great idea Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime be so totally non user friendly that I give up for the 2 time and get my money back again. They need to consolidate some thing quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organization. When you fix it please call me. sign: wish I can have spend my dollar 105.00 dollar."

However I can play music through Google player or the device's music player. I do not even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re download all my music. Before I would pull my SD card reset phone and re mount the SD card continue listen to music. Not happy!"
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do... I have Rhapsody now so that be what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference be rhapsody be easy and I do not have to pay additional for a lot of the song. The easy to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do video / music / foodway to expensive! / shop but the price and ease need to get good on prime."
281,"Amazon",2016-07-23,4,"lot of new music The app itself can be easy to navigate but I be still go to give it a high rate because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not have a problem also get to listen to that song on this app for free.

There be extremely long pause while browse my collection and frequent force close. I really would prefer the functionality and layout of Amazon's app but the horrible lag in browse the UI be unacceptable. I cannot recommend this app for large music collection.

I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I do not want to use a 3 party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely back up One last thing Amazon be awesome too because it do not conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never do but the Samsung music player do. Now Amazon this mess that up again because now I have to get a 3 party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it work properly in my car.

1960,"Amazon",2014-10-19,1,"Mac version of the Music Player be GARBAGE The Mac version of Amazon Music Player be garbage pure and simple. I can not speak for the window version but the Mac version frequently read: almost always hang for LONG period of time before show track in any section of the player. It also appear to use a lot of resource I see system wide issue while use Music Player but when I completely close out of it OS X go back to behave like it should. Now that we be force to use this player to download any music we have add to Amazon Music I have go from merely irritate to absolutely angry. It be AWFUL software and after several year deal with quirk and outright problem with Amazon Music I really wonder if Amazon will EVER get this work correctly. Other fun issue: Badly match song completely the wrong recording we be talk live song be replace by studio version! You can attempt to correct the match but I have yet to get this to work good. miss song! Inexplicably some song be just go from my library. Totally random much album be fine other be miss this or that song or maybe a couple. infuriate. Tag editor destroy exist ID3 tag: if you dare edit any info in the file you have upload you will be reward with a downloadable version that have completely strip out ALL tag. You will not know what song be what. ALL tag be empty so there will be no artist to go by no track name no track numb no album name. NOTHING. This sound completely unacceptable be it not for the need to rarely do this but what make it truly completely unacceptable be the fact that track in your library may randomly have their ID3 tag alter by either the uploader whatever software run on Amazon's server or the Music Player. And you be screw at that point. Other than that it be GREAT."

However in my experience thus far the sound process and regeneration through my bluetooth connection to my car stereo be lack. The full range of the music do not seem to be get through almost a if it think I be play to headphone and so it be cut back on the bass a bite. I have find some not many! music player that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault but I can not do that with the Amazon Music App. It also do not show the time track of the track that be play where some player seem to be able to do that just fine.

3399,"Amazon",2014-07-09,3,"Where be the Fire TV version of the app??? I like this app for the much part. I have use the PC version for window the iPad app and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it perform good enough but i do have a few gripe about it. First complaint be where be the version for the Fire TV? I be use the app on a Apple Samsung and Microsoft device but Amazon have not get a version yet for their own device?? I keep hear soon but soon be never soon enough! My next complaint be with edit song / album you have upload to the cloud. a with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replace there be no way to edit album art. I have over 15 000 song upload to the Amazon Cloud Player and a numb of them do not have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my song / album have a high quality image embed in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile app can not do this so be it but you should at less be able to copy / paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music iTunes etc. I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G / 4G without constant buffer so i have to make sure I remember to download music via wifi before leave the house. I do not believe this be a limitation of the app but have much to do with my cell carrier Sprint in my area. I also can not stream from Spotify either so it be much of a network issue. I also do not like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use service like Spotify slack and Amazon Music to discover band a good a play music I already know so I do not want to add music to my library that I may not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turn out you like it. Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI be nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon with their deep pocket to sign much music label and make much music available for Prime member in the future but the selection be not bad consider Prime Music just launch about 3 week ago. Still have a way to go to reach Spotify's catalog of song / artist / album."

I buy 4 song off a album for some reason it do not add them to my phone. I try then buy the full album to see if that would work and it download all the song but the first 4 I buy. I go to the amazon website to see if I can download the song to my computer and then transfer them no apparently there be a problem with my download and all I be able to do be submit a ticket.

Yes you can not natively download to a sd card however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to a sd card. If you have ever use a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. it be just like move file from one folder to another. Your music player app will read mp3 file from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the setting in order to eliminate a step but sometimes we need to do thing on our own and use a little think to get there."

I have to redownload and resort the lose song. Now it be do it again. It start by no long read the artist and album info just the song title. Then it stop read the file altogether. Other music app read and play the file fine. I see the song file on the card but the app will not play them. This time my cloud too have only a odd assortment of purchase and already own song so i can not even redownload and there be no option to get the app to re scan what be on the SD card where the app itself put the file.

Lack of stay on the lock screen when pause or not automatically resume when you receive and end a phone call! Prime music be unable to find horrible search ability! I be on the verge of cancel my amazon prime music and go with something else since some idiot screw up a perfectly functional app!!! I listen to my music while drive in my drive job and this piece of garbage have become so un user friendly! I can not keep mess with it while drive it need to work a it use to.

11711,"Amazon",2016-01-05,2,"it be not entirely terrible. A few thing I like about it be... I be expect a bite much from this app. do not get me wrong though it be not entirely terrible. A few thing I like about it be the addition of lyric to some song and how simple it be to look for music and buy a artist's album. However I do experience some issue. The fact that when I be listen to a song and lose my internet connection the song would start all over and you be force to listen to the entire song all again once connection have be restore. Another thing I dislike about Prime Music be the fact that there be not many artist. Only really know one. One of the thing that really bug me a bite be the fact that the app need a lot of my private information. Like no thank you. I end up uninstalling the app for that reason and since it take up a lot of space on my phone. I would rather stick to Pandora."
11712,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"get good with age I have be use Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have see constant improvement with every update. This be a perk that be not to be treat a a extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it. One special note be that you be allow up to 10 device but if you call Amazon and explain that you no long have some of that device they be much than accommodate. The selection of music have become very impressive and add music to your library be easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library. Amazon music work very good on all my device and computer. It be truly a great value add service."

I really do like the app but it be a serious space hog and there just be not enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for app that can not be move to the SD card.

But there be 2 complaint I have though. If you put a song in twice by mistake it will not let you delete one of them unless it delete both from the app. There need to be a way to just delete a copy. Also when I travel I may be listen to direction and turn it off. a soon a I restart my car start it come on / even if I do not turn it on. And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on. There be just a glitch be it come on without turn it on that can be fix. But I love the music and so do my grandchild. We all have our favorite station. Highly recommend this Amazon App!"
11722,"Amazon",2016-06-08,3,"delete playlists I have be a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appear. And maybe the problem be specific to the Fire HD 10? It seem to work fine on my desktop but I be not go to risk test it either since I be talk about thousand of song which be only manageable with playlists. After a few week of listen to my music offline which be a mix of purchase prime and my own collection of CD song the player start skip over certain / random purchase Prime song. Of course they be the one I listen to the much. flashback of digital right usage? clear the cache do nothing sync do nothing. Support have me delete the datum which fix the playback but it also delete the playlists. Playlists that constitute hour if not day of music go poof! The option to download the cloud playlist do not work past 1 to 3 song. transfer a large music library from my computer be good do directly on the SD card with a card reader a the USB cable option hang up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchase music result in duplicate on the device. Oh sure I remember which one be which since the last century. The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolate and safe? It would make so much much sense to have that playlists synchronisable would not it? remind me of when ms quit sell music their player crap out and amz step in."

No? a if I be suppose to recognize this people after which the station be name... right? I would love to learn about new artist but not at the risk of open a station that absolutely set my tooth on edge i. e. cow hard country... make me ill. Where be a FILTER for the prime station?

When play music OFF line from track that have already be download to my device playback frequently pause a if it be have a buffer problem similar to a stream ON line connection. the interruption to playback be incredibly annoy and do not happen on any other music player use the same device. 2. There be no way to auto play music on bluetooth connect. When I start my car I want my music to start play a soon a BT connection be establish. The Amazon Music app do not support this feature. I have try use other app Bluetooth AutoStart and other and can successfully LAUNCH the Amazon Music app on bluetooth connect but I be not able to PLAY music unless I unlock the screen and select the music I want to play.... good.. If I already have Amazon Music App run on the phone it will transfer over to the car and keep play but that be only if the Music app be already run. For example... Black Player music app will auto play on bluetooth connect from a cold start. Black Player do not need to be run. It just recognize the BT connection and start play the song that be last play when it be turn off. This be the way a music app should work... of course you should have a set to be able to turn off this feature if you do not want it... If Black Player can do it... why can not Amazon?"

11783,"Amazon",2017-08-23,2,"Amazon Prime Music I use it because it be free and without commercial otherwise I would not bother. I get the Prime version with my prime account for free otherwise I would not use it. The app itself be pretty look but the functionality be average and the music service itself be below average. The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music be no commercial otherwise every other music app Pandora slack etc. be much good in every way. The available music be limit and music station in Amazon Prime Music be horrible. My guess be that it be because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they would have to pay the artist and do not want to in a free service. Example: The other app have a top pop station where all the late and great be play and the selection be excellent. Amazon Prime Music not even close. Amazon claim this station / play list be create by expert. I would add say it differently.... they be create by expert who be limit by the music available."

I try email customer service and get no help. I do call and do get to speak with a rep who inform me there be no exit button in quick fashion. thank that answer my question. That be all I want. The whole thing be that every other music app I have on the phone have a Exit button available in it be menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? good believe it do. Free Radio? Sure do though it can be a bite clunky at time. Heck even Anime Radio have a Exit button that shut down the app. But this app? no! That be a serious flaw. cause me to get rid of the app. It take use the Unistall menu option rather than just drag it to the trash can but at less it be now go. And good riddance. If they ever get their act together and put in a exit button I will reinstall it. Perhaps Amazon just ought to stick to what they do very good namely sell stuff and forget service.

My original reflex be to blame the sound engineer for sloppy control. I would now like to retract this negative assessment a I have find the cause although I do not understand the detail mechanism yet. So I be write this just in case other come across something similar. Let me add this only occur on this Beatles track so I be fixate that it be the new track that be at fault. good it appear they be not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamine the audio setting of my TV. Not that with alter the frequency response but one connect to the speaker system.

For example if I download My Life from Billy Joel's great hit it will try to play Only the Good Die Young even if I haven't download it. This cause the music to stop and I have to correct it.

Very hard to keep musical preference clear a a Prime member this be a nice way to get music since you have access to hundred of artist and genre of music. But the app be design piss poor and be not user friendly at all. First the interface be PAINFUL to use. Not only do the app NEVER keep your music last listen to in check there be no real way to make a Playlist keep recently play music in check or even find what you last listen to. Sometimes the app save it but half the time I be look for what I last listen to which be annoy! Secondly the UI be confuse. It list cloud Prime music library and store but it never really have the list right for what you be listen to or want to listen to. It be just really a pain to find music I want to hear even my own music! Thirdly how do you make a Playlist? I still haven't figure that out. The app be so painful to use I really haven't bother.

I be able to make playlists which be nice but when I play the playlists it stop after every couple of song receive notification do not make a difference in the playlist it just stop play randomly but then other time it play all the way through... I would say this be the big frustration. Also it be slow at download. When I have rhapsody it be lighten fast almost so much so I would lose track of where I be!

Sometimes search return NO result but when I search again a few minute late it find result. The app sometimes switch between Cloud and Prime without warn. Music stutter too much compare to other player. I can stream HD in YouTube Hulu and Netflix just fine but I can not listen to a song from Amazon without it skip. The selection be limit.

If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis the service be great. BUT find music be a chore. artist be easy enough to find but actually get to a album you want be tricky. The majority of my listen be full album. From the album selector for a band there be NO distinguish between single ep or full album nor be there any note of year year be visible once the album have be select but I have already see several where the year be blatantly wrong or list the year of the re issue which be technically correct but generally mislead. This be a NIGHTMARE for band with several album especially artist who name the album after a title track release the album a clean version of the album a limit edition of the album the title track a a EP and again a a single. it be common for me to view all album and it be 3 indistinguishable link all with the same album art and name. I have also have technical issue stem from album selection. For example from the my recommendation screen I can click to a album and I can add the album to my music but from the band's page that album be NOT in their list specific example below. Furthermore a band's list of album be not its own screen it be a kind of popup so when I select a album if it be not the one I want and I hit back I be return to the band's main page. Not their list of album force me to repeat this cycle. For reference the album I can listen to but not find on the band's page be The Nexus by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there be that The Nexus be also a single and there be two entry for say single in the band's album list and I think one of them should be a link to the full album but be not."

There seem to be way too many hiccup. song start and stop very frequently. Play button be still activate but shut it off and start it back on do not resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This be really the last thing any of us want to do: micro manage our stream music player instead of listen to music and do other thing while we listen novel concept.

Also the reaction time when you do something Skip a track... play a different album... scan forward in a track... be significantly delay. Time for a version rollback happy I wish.

CONS0 it be just slow and laggy and freeze all the time. While I be upload or it decide to download something completely outside of my control it can not be use. EDIT Since the time of my originally post this review amazon have introduce several update that have incremementally begin to address my problem and I be so thankful for that. I have start use another music player but it be so much easy to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it be great to see that a company a big a Amazon can listen to complaint and improve on product. I STILL want it to be a lot easy to remove music from my computer directly from the app but they add the see file on computer option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. thank Amazon. 1 On the new app they have this extensive list / filter system which be mostly redundant and yet so complicate I hardly ever know what subset of my music I be listen to. be it my OFFLINE music on the CLOUD filter by download date... or be it the album section with ALL MUSIC yet only purchase song order by upload date? There be NOTHING smart about this set up and it only serve to obscure the next point2 I can not STOP IT FROM download EVERYTHING! I like to try out new album / song and support artist.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite song for easy listen even without internet yaknow if I wind up in the stone age or something.. Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything although I do not believe that I do but even so I can not find any set that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they take away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I can have potentially use to delete unwanted song from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF give ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ask ABOUT THE CLOUD. 3 it be now much difficult than ever to donload or upload song when I want to... have me drag and drop song onto the word upload or download be totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple song.. which lead me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE song. That be a completely necessary / useful option that I do not understand the logic behind take out. 4 When I click make a playlist from this song nothing happen... I probably just do not understand what I be suppose to do maybe? But I be fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that much be quite perplex. PROSThe color scheme be nice... the icon look good? I originally be go to give this app a 2 star rate becuse I think the aesthetic really be a upgrade... but honestly there be such a downgrade in functionality this app be terrible now..

In the old version when you want to upload music you add it by choose a file / folder with a browser or you drag file / folder onto the app. Then you see the list of song with a upload icon next to the one in queue and the finish one indicate a such. After upload you can clear the queue so the next time you upload something you can see exactly what be happen. Now you drag file / folder onto the app a before but only the song that be actively upload or finish be display. Unless you count you have no idea how many be leave to upload.

But the problem be when you do not have solid datum coverage or wifi like in a tunnel or in a build with thick wall. a it try to sync the app freeze and you can not do anything but force close it. Ideally there should be a option to sync only on wifi or manually by press a button. I have several album download / cache locally and never stream. So the app should just play that local album and forget about try to sync any other song I have in the cloud. Sheesh. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I download this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. it be actually not a bad app even if you do not have Prime or do not purchase music. It recognize / play non DRM music that be already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple responsive and not annoy. I like it a little much than the Google Music app. And it be much good than all that free app that either have limit feature or annoy ad unless you pay up. I will also echo my complaint here about not be able to store Prime / purchase music on the SD card. it be really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card but not any of the music. In a perfect world we would have unlimited / reliable mobile datum everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality be we still need to download / cache locally to our mobile device. Hopefully Amazon will release a future version of this app that will allow you store purchase music on the SD card."

There be no music enhancement such a any kind of editor or EQ. I would like to see a sophisticate sound normalization and EQ option if possible. The Prime Music upload app admittedly a separate app that go with this one and should actually be roll into this one do seem in immediate need of a major refresh a it seem long wind and clunky to use. It should be much much user friendly plainly speak. a for the Prime Music Service itself good because it be free a a Prime member I be happy for anything that add value that I would actually use and benefit from. That say Prime Music have a long way to go to be a actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for. Yep if you be pay your go to want Spotify Tidal or Pandora. With this service you do not request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band re record the song which even if you be four or five cocktail in would sound ridiculous compare to the real song. This be a real serious fault of Prime Music and I be shock it be even within acceptable legal limit i. e. the song say it be Day After Day by Badfinger but it sound like a attempt and often a poor one to sound like Badfinger... So how can this song be represent a THE song by THE band??? Here's the bottom line: If Amazon Prime Music be go to be anything other than a free music service which Amazon hope keep Prime customer re up due to value Amazon be go to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the bait and switch sound BAD RE recording. And speak of sound the fidelity of actual source be sometimes noticeably not the good it be likely the source and not the stream quality itself I think Amazon need to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too. I have be critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free song in the cloud. They can be one Amazon offer a part of Prime a good a my purchase and upload.

It appear that it be not possible to stream the music via Airplay like you can in iTunes. Without this ability the App be pretty much worthless for that who stream music to a remote stereo via wifi. On edit: Apple may be much to blame for not allow stream to multiple location. If one option / click the speaker icon in the bar at the top of the finder screen you do have the choice to pick a stream location. Unfortunately you can only choose one location at a time so if you want to listen to music from your computer a good a remotely you be out of luck. increase my rate to three star since this be not Amazon's fault."

Unify cloud music and device music. This can be replace by a simple icon for one or the other and would make it easy to see what you have on each without flip back and forth. 2. Be able to access your wishlist / shop list from the app. buy music and have it available instantly in cloud player be awesome but it be a pain to have to go to Amazon. com to pick up the album that I have already save in my list. 3.

On my kindle at less it play on while I go surf the web or play other app which I find really cool. It seem a if you do not have to use your email to use the app but you will be able to customize your radio if you do. it be definitely worth the free payment and gigabite storage for you music lover out there.

It be a novel way of provide music and the system give you the ability to give a thumb up or thumb down on any music selection you listen to. In this way you can get your station or station to be very close to the type of music you would like to listen to at that time. it be wonderful to be able to get music this way and like I say there be probably a lot much I can do with the service beyond just the music."

39051,"Pandora",2015-02-18,5,"Pandora Review Five star rate for excellence in music. Two thing I would recommend though. 1. do not put add on even if you haven't upgrade to pro yet. This will help us enjoy worship the Lord and have our mind focus on Him. 2. I suggest that you have much song selection for a artist instead of switch to different artist on their radio. For example if Phil Wickham have much album out can his station just play much of that instead of just one or two? that be my thought. Otherwise I would give it a five star rate because of its easy access availability to access different station and the superb bookmark a good. thank for your free service Pandora I will have to say though that your Christian station be the good! happy"

While it work fine on the Android tablet Pandora be a nightmare on the Kindle Fire. It take forever to load and usually multiple try; it often stop play for no apparent reason in the middle of song and may or may not resume at any give moment; and even if it do play good when I try to turn Pandora off it will not shut off. I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit. Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire. Two star because it do in fact work on other tablet.

I only receive my Kindle about 2 week ago and be already get lot of repeat song which should not be happen so soon with all the zillions of song out there. Also when I click on the Beatles station I get a lot of music before Beatles music happen. Yes I be on shuffle but I think when I be on a station I would hear at less a lot of that music. But the short loop be my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't update to the no advertisement membership because I do not mind them. I think perhaps if I do upgrade I would get a long time between repeat song but that be not what no ad mean so I be not sure that would solve the problem."

In my case I create several 'radio stations' base on performer such a Simon and Garfunkel. I know S and G have record many song but only hear three or four of them along with a lot of other performer music that be of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many song you get a message that be not allow a often a you like. I also find over the two month I try use it that much of the music be from album record at 'live' event I prefer the high quality studio song I do not seem to have any choice in the issue. No long use Pandora."

No airplane mode with this one! It take me a little time to figure out how to navigate but it be fairly simple so I think I have get the basic down. The good part be that you can run this in the background while you do other thing on your Kindle; I like to listen a I read especially since I haven't get my own music onto my Fire yet.

Now one have to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function button. Plus for this downgrade in feature and function they start charge much money per month. Plus there be NO WHERE you can call talk or email them about your complaint of concern. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenue anywhere whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel NO refund you just have to wait till your subscription run out. So they recently change it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customer.

Sleep timer function to shut off automatically. Bookmark a current track you be listen to. Also a option to buy the track if you like it that much. Also you can touch the picture and another screen open from behind and allow you information about the artist feature of the track and lyric. THAT be very cool. allow you to create a many station a you like. If you do not like a song in your genre then thumb it down and it should never play again.

Overall a nice way to play Pandora radio on your mobile device while do other thing like read or browse the web. This review be much for people that know and enjoy Pandora radio for the web already. If you already do not like Pandora for whatever reason you be not go to like the app obviously. Previously give it 3 star for lack of certain feature like the ability to edit the Shuffle. use to be a bummer to have to log into Pandora web just to change the QuickMix station list especially consider that my prefer device for Pandora my Kindle Fire would just redirect to the app when I would try to use pandora. com on the silk browser. Recent update have add this miss functionality and much nice feature which seem to have make it hang up once in a while but that get fix too and the Pandora app be now everything I want from it so it have earn two much star! Way to go it be about time!"
44175,"Pandora",2016-06-10,5,"NA"
44177,"Pandora",2012-01-20,4,"for that with prob if you have trouble change the stationon the Kiele fire then try go down below to where the home botton be and hit the botton in the middle with line or the one that look like a list and it will give you option. just play around with it and you will find it or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton. now yes there be advertisement that play after 3 4 song but the only way Pandora will be free be if they do that advertisement. they only last about 30 second. i have leave my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora play and it do not die. if you leave it play but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play let you save much battery power. Pandora be not good nor bad it just depeneds if you really want to PAY for the good servise. if you want free music of your choice on you kendle fire then maybe it be not so bad but if you want the good then sure you can buy it."

It be perfectly integrate with their online system already set up so if you be plug in online in a browser this application work great. problem you will find if you use the free version of Pandora: The advertisement frequently pop up into a large portion of the screen and be hard to close but easy to open. You cannot alter much of the information about a particular radio station where music come from such a artist song e. g. EDIT It be not possible to get a scroll list of previously play music. You can only view the one you be listen to at the moment. This be now possible. They have fix it and make the application even good. My qualm with the application but it be good nonetheless."

Also it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic or live version right after the original record of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip much song and not have to pay to get rid of add but it be understandable and can be bad with them. They be not a easy to accidently hit a on some app but I do still pay to not have them. I think it be worth pay so I be not interrupt by loud add. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."

Name a artist and voila you have a station that will deliver tune by that artist and similar artist. One caveat if you listen a lot and I do you will soon recognize the limit to the tune by your rave artist that will repeat. Usually this will be the song you would expect on a great hit album and often that be exactly where they come from. But hey if you get bore with the repeat quickly create a new station.

Anyway there must have be a update at some point because the app have be trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there be a quit option when I want to stop it a oppose to completely log out. After use the quit option when I want to get back in all I have to do be select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launch with no need to sign in.

I start off a a free user and love Spotify even then... however I have to admit that I be now a Spotify Premium user student and love it even much. The app work great the Discover Weekly playlists be usually awesome and I do not regret pay for it at all. What I like about it be that I download almost any song that I want to my device and then listen to it anywhere until I get play it to death and find a new favorite song. I would recommend this app to pretty much anyone but if you be like like me you may get hook and not be able to get away. One important note: Spotify usually have clean radio edit of pretty much all song but right now it do not have a general filter / set that you can use to filter. If you be offend by profanity or worry about objectionable content and do not want to monitor it closely that may pose a problem because beside look at each individual song I do not know a workaround."

53422,"Spotify",2016-04-23,4,"thing to be work on Spotify be a great app for listen to your favorite song. be able tomake playlists that have song you already like give it a slight edge over Pandora. Since both be free and use ad to allow yoyu to not have subscription it really come down to whether you feel know what song be go to play versus get introduce to new song you may like. While Spotify do both it do not really do the latter a often where Pandora be entirely that. Really it come down to personal preference and what you be look for. If you want to know what be go to play base on a playlist you create go with Spotify but if you want much of a radio deal go Pandora. Both have thing they can improve on. Now a for both apps' premium upgrade Spotify in my opinion have much bang for your buck. You have the ability to skip and amount of song peak and see what be up next have no ad and download song or playlists to your device for offline listen. This mean you do not have to have signal nor do you have to use so much datum. In my own opinion Spotify and Pandora be great app for the type of music provider they be. Honestly if you can not choose between them get both! If you already do and what to go premium on one go with Spotify because it offer much in my opinion although it be much expensive than Pandora."

And it be mostly just that: that filler channel you throw on the screen when you be bore or to have something on in the background when do other thing. If you be into some of the cable channel you will notice a decline in program quality.

I would rather buy a CD if that be the case. I do not like the Playlist Radio because it play song that be nothing like the playlist. it be irritate. The info say that Spotify get to know what you like but I have zero Abba song and nothing like that on my playlists but yet what song do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba of course. I suppose I be too optimistic in hope that Spotify be like use your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow.

You can not choose what song you want to listen to it absolutely insist on shuffle play and then you can only flip three or four song before you be force to listen to the current song. And I mean force. You can not exit out of the song and pick a new artist nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choice you have the user have to have premium otherwise they can not see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow go to the next song if it be a song you do not like from the artist then you only have two much completely random try before you get what you get and you do not throw a fit. For me though I just delete the app and go search for another music app. Sorry Spotify you just lose a customer.: /"

It`s a incredible app especially if you have a premium account. There`s a immense numb of selection to pick from; pop latino rock country and so on. Another thing you can do if your a premium user be skip song a infinite numb of time and pick the song your heart desire to hear. there be a numb of thing you can do. If you be a music lover I totally recommend this app to you. Even if you be not a premium user you will automatically fall in love with this app you will be blind by your love for music.

This be incredibly inconvenient and there be some song I simply can not play anymore. Now if you want to play a song you have to set it on shuffle so it choose a random song usually not the one I want and stay on the song until I get frustrate and try to play another song from another album. If you get this app then I would buy premium because it be a good app; it be just a crappy update."

I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connect to wifi but now I just do not want to use it. There be no harm in keep this version the same a the computer. Profit be not a excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you a a company be cripple artists' profit at the same time. I would rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price be a lot much reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I be really encourage you to change it back because I guarantee that you have lose many user to this and you be just go to lose much. I use to recommend Spotify to people but now my view have change.

61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I think it would be... When I initially hear that Spotify would be free on mobile / tablet I be thrill. When I see it be not the case on the Kindle I be sad. When I notice today that they would upload anew I be thrill again. Now I be just disappoint. I use Spotify on my computer regularly and I be glad to see that my playlists upload to this app without a hitch. That be approximately the end of that emotion because of the follow: 1. Without premium one must be online to listen. Why be this a problem? Because some of the playlists I import be of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer be offline why be there no option to download say music to the app? 2. One's personal playlists must be play on shuffle. Why be this a problem? good it be certainly not the much terrible thing in the world and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often but if I start to listen and a few song in decide I want a specific song next I can not do that. 3. It like to give one suggest song when one be try to play one's own playlists. It do not have the good algorithm for this. Why be this a problem? If I be listen to The Color Spectrum and it decide to throw a song from Migrant in the mix that be really jar. Besides that its algorithm seem to mainly throw either much of the artist at you No I do not like every album that band have put out. or just lump everything into a few too big category hip hop indie rock country and throw the much random s from say category at you And no new Train be nothing like Of Great and Mortal man.. You only get a small numb of skip if you do not have premium. sound a little familiar yet? Only it be not. Because that other app you be think of have user feedback upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lack that. So this app can play all the song from Migrant at me a thousand time over and never learn that I hate it. Spotify on my computer? 5 star. Spotify on my Kindle? I will stick with Pandora."
