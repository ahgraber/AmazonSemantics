84,"Amazon",2014-06-23,2,"Prime Music need Work Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection be small and include mostly old music. While it generally work okay for the music it do have I be unable to find any way to just search the music that be available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I go to listen to a song it be go to charge me. If you be able to limit the search and list of song to only that available for free I would have give it a high score but at the moment it be a lot much frustration than listen pleasure."

The selection be a little scarce but it be new so I be sure the selection will increase in time. seem that Amazon would put much effort in their prime video service which be still very limit and lack the selection of their competitor instead of launch additional service. Just seem a little backwards to me but I will not complain about something free!!"
107,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Not happy with Android app I do not know what the core problem be but I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 AT and T and I have another app that can track thing like when app restart multiple time consume resource like RAM memory response time and temperature and for whatever reason this and all the other Amazon app have period where they will restart anywhere from 5 to 47 time in a 5 minute period.

The music / mantra that I like to listen to be on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. it be o dollar 2 little than Google Music which be not much of a difference so decide to keep Google Music.

This be much hard than 3dg and much compose then staind. I haven't buy a album in 5 year... this be worthy enough to buy and it be be on repeat since I get it! Incredible band and I be stoke on their music! If you like hard rock with small amount of metal and insanely good lyric... buy this album!"
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix Great its part of Prime"
137,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"bad update ever!!! This be a force update that if you uninstall it it remove your amazon app completely. I lose all of my playlists and there be a lot much step to get to the song or album you want. Too many drop down menu and too may ad. And I do not know if this have anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen have change and now I have multiple page to move thru to find what I want. Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
138,"Amazon",2017-10-23,5,"Five star Great!"
150,"Amazon",2017-01-01,4,"can not remove only the duplicate song. Very cool but there be no way to delete duplicate song without have to delete all of the copy of the song instead of just the extra one."
153,"Amazon",2017-11-12,5,"Five star I love this app. It even work with Alexia."
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five star Love it"
157,"Amazon",2016-04-13,1,"The bad Amazon Product Ever If I can give this app negative star I would. I have be a longtime Amazon customer since the '90's. When the Amazon MP3 app come out it be great. There be free daily MP3's and I buy quite a bite of music from my phone. Then in update it would become sluggish but then you would get a new Android phone and it would be okay. But then there be the change to Amazon Music and the authentication scheme Amazon come up with for this would then break my login in other Amazon app shop and Kindle. It become unusable on my last phone. When I get my current phone I try it again and it work for maybe a month before it suddenly decide that my phone have be register to someone else and I can not access my cloud library or Prime Music. Amazon Customer Support for this be pretty much non existent they will only talk to you on the phone and then they will tell you to wipe your phone and start over reinstall EVERYTHING which be ridiculous. I recently try the app again and it be miraculously work for no obvious reason though the Kindle app would then keep ask me to re login but with this much recent update it be now once again break for me it give me a network error so I try revert to my backup of the previous version and guess what it now say that my phone be register to someone else and I can not access my cloud library or Prime Music. So I give up Amazon. I have buy a ton of crap from you and I would probably buy a lot much music from you if I can buy it on my phone and be a even happy Prime customer if I can listen to Prime Music on my phone but this app be a total disaster and the big black mark on my otherwise sterling opinion of your company. The shop and Kindle app work great Music work great on my iPad and Kindle Fire and Fire TV so I do not know what your problem be."
159,"Amazon",2016-11-27,4,"I dislike the update user interface I dislike the update user interface. wish it be much seamlessly integrate into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user."
165,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon music with prime music I have try download it my 3 unit Desk top be okay but do not let me access all my playlistsMy Android only seem to have some of the album but mostly single from the album listedMy note pad I install it then I have a problem so I delete it now it tell me I already have it load but I cannot find the icon to reinstall itAll you seem to want be for me to purchase much music though prime when I can not play the music I already have load"
167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right it be a alright music stream service. My only issue be that its crazy how for Amazon to have all this option such a kindle echo music prime etc. they can not seem to keep up with the update payment information for one Amazon account. It make no sense to me AT ALL."
172,"Amazon",2017-03-14,4,"Four star great work"
177,"Amazon",2016-08-23,5,"it be much good than listen to the radio I use this all the time. I have the app on my phone so I can take it with me every where I go. I have find sooo much music from back in the day that I think I would never hear again. it be much good than listen to the radio... no commercial! It make all my other music app obsolete... just plain love it!"
179,"Amazon",2016-08-21,5,"Love this perk with prime! I love be able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This be a great perk for amazon prime member! We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that run through the stereo and surround speaker so I can listen while cook. I also do this in the car. I love all the chanel's offer."
180,"Amazon",2014-07-29,3,"No artist datum When I use with Bluetooth in car the display datum be miss artist. I can see track and album but artist datum miss. This only happen with Amazon music. Google songza milk Pandora Spotify all display complete datum"
182,"Amazon",2015-11-04,3,"The Amazon Cloud Player app on Samsung Smart TV be not good. I be please with Amazon Prime Music on my desktop and Android device but I be not please with the Amazon Cloud Player on my Samsung Smart TV. The Cloud Player have limit functionality and will not play Amazon Prime music it will only play my music. Unfortunately 90 percent of my use of Amazon Prime Music would be via my Samsung Smart TV. Therefore I be back to Pandora and other app on the TV."
184,"Amazon",2017-09-22,1,"Waste of time. Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expect way much from Amazon."
186,"Amazon",2015-09-26,1,"IT keep crash... AND crash... AND OOPS... crash LIKE a 80 YEAR OLD INTO A farmer MARKET! I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crash every few minute. I have use it in the past with no issue but with this HTC one M8 it crash and then want me to send a report. Every time this happen it shut do whatever other program i be use. GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!! YES I have try update do not helpYES I have try to install / re install its factory so there be no total uninstall"
188,"Amazon",2016-04-06,4,"Nice perk for prime member For prime member this come with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phone and device. I be surprise that there be a pretty good selection of current hit music that be include for free with prime. I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists. Also allow for cache music to phone / tablet memory or external memory card."
197,"Amazon",2016-07-04,5,"Five star I be so happy to be able to have a offline mode to listen to the music."
198,"Amazon",2016-03-03,5,"LOVE Amazon Prime Music! I LOVE Amazon Prime Music! It be a great benefit to have include in my Amazon Prime membership. That be one of the main reason I get my membership. I like be able to listen to the music I have pick on my phone via bluetooth in my car. I can switch it to the Offline Library so it do not charge me datum to listen to my music. I would not be without it!"
201,"Amazon",2017-10-16,5,"Five star I love be able to create my own playlists."
211,"Amazon",2016-11-09,5,"Five star Love this app. It have so many feature."
219,"Amazon",2014-11-10,2,"Very disappoint consider look elsewhere for a cloud service / music player Regularly crash and give error I have talk to tech support numerous time each time it appear to be good for a couple day and go back to be horribly glitchy and unwieldy. Sometimes I will play a song from my device not even on the cloud and it will take 10 minute to load. Other time I will open it and it will immediately crash about 50 time until I can finally start to use it. I have have this for about a year and have to uninstall / reinstall it probably 30 time because of issue."
220,"Amazon",2016-04-05,1,"Not worth the money You have to pay for almost all the music pointless just get Spotify cheap and have much music"
221,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Easy To Use Love it! No problem with the app and always easy to find my tune."
228,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Good music selection and easy download Music be easy to save to computer or device. When I download it to hard drive it go to iTunes."
229,"Amazon",2015-05-27,1,"loss track of library I use this to run with. Only problem be everything I log on I have nothing in my library. I have to sign out sign back in and redownload the song in my playlist. Then a soon a I disconnect from WiFi it lose my song again and I have to pause my workout and do the same process over again. Very update bug."
238,"Amazon",2016-01-25,5,"Super Job with Amazon Prime Music! I be very impress with the selection and the quality or music! I have just start use this service but from what I can tell it be absolutely top notch! a endless selection of artist station a good. Great job Amazon!"
239,"Amazon",2016-10-02,4,"I like it. Wish there be much choice I like it. Wish there be much choice. The selection be limit"
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App need some improvement. I use this app all the time. Unfortunately it can not be use safely while drive. On my Kia optimum it will not change song by push the up or down on the steer wheel. A voice command / Alexa style function would be nice for search for song while drive."
256,"Amazon",2016-01-09,3,"good but can be good. The search function can be much user friendly and it would be awesome if you can organize your library by genre so if you want to hear only a specific type of music you ould do that. I understand that there be playlists for this but the amount of song you can add to each list be limit to like 60. Its good suit to people who do not have a much music on it."
260,"Amazon",2017-07-23,4,"Four star like it"
261,"Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"A Grandmother with a MP3 App? I listen to music a I take my daily walk. I choose this product because the FM radio app be non functional and at time Pandora be unreliable. The Amazon MP3 app be amaze. it be always there! I like that I can create customize playlists never have one before. The fact that music I buy from Amazon be downloadable to my electronic device be truly slick. I purchasedd a MP3 player for one of my grandchild but the whole thing seem too mysterious and complicate to me. I be not too savvy with app anyway but I be regularly discover some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon for make this free app available to your customer."
262,"Amazon",2017-07-31,2,"2 star I be a international subscriber. I can not make use of my prime music nor video. I can not even buy anything. My credit card be accept for good purchase but not for music or video. Apple be do a good job! Too bad."
264,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"Would be great if it work... On my Samsung Galaxy S4; this app will not play song from Prime Music. Before the upgrade I use this app extensively and like it. It now either freeze crash or freeze and crash every time I try to play any of the Prime Music song. The song in my library before the upgrade wok fine. So essentially Prime music have add zero song for my enjoyment and the app upgrade have break the app. good play!"
265,"Amazon",2016-02-04,1,"What a waste of a great idea Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime be so totally non user friendly that I give up for the 2 time and get my money back again. They need to consolidate some thing quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organization. When you fix it please call me. sign: wish I can have spend my dollar 105.00 dollar."
266,"Amazon",2015-11-04,1,"never do figure out how to get any of the... never do figure out how to get any of the benefit of prime to work before my free trial end. no clue how to play music or watch anything"
273,"Amazon",2016-06-06,5,"Great deal I already have Prime for free ship now I have free music too No commercial good user interface. The content be not a broad a Spotify but I find lot of music I like. Also Jason Aldean be on Amazon Music but not on Apple's music site."
274,"Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Love love love Amazon! I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shop and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
275,"Amazon",2015-12-02,4,"Great service A great service and good worth it. You can find much any kind of music with the exception of some old song. Some great movie to watch though I haven't get a chance to watch a lot of them. order place with prime arrive on time and no problem. I would recommend to anyone who like to watch movie or listen to music and want to get your order in a couple of day."
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do... I have Rhapsody now so that be what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference be rhapsody be easy and I do not have to pay additional for a lot of the song. The easy to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do video / music / foodway to expensive! / shop but the price and ease need to get good on prime."
291,"Amazon",2016-03-01,1,"cancel can not make this App work on my device cancel the order."
296,"Amazon",2015-10-07,1,"USA issue Credit Card.... seriously? Music Collection under prime can be good nevertheless i be happy with it because i do not need my spotify subscription edit After enjoy the app for about a week it get disable because i do not have a USA issue credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card be good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use / buy music with this app..."
303,"Amazon",2017-03-08,5,"Great for any music lover Love and use it"
304,"Amazon",2016-04-03,1,"One Star Really? How about flip a switch And let this run on my Shield Tablet."
308,"Amazon",2015-10-22,3,"Not impress. it be not horrible but it do not have near the music selection that spotify do. It want to charge you for so much."
310,"Amazon",2016-07-05,3,"work good. Not overly user friendly. lack any serious interactive function. Your download music for offline listen have to be individually add to Playlist. There seem to be no way to modify the property of the individual audio file to identify a song a a genre that you think it much closely resemble."
314,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five star I think it be great! good than Pandora."
315,"Amazon",2015-09-12,5,"prime be numb 1 for me do not care about the nay sayers. Prime be great so oo many song playlists and genre of music to choose from. I also use Pandora. I pnow prefer Prime over pandora because I can play my music offline. There be a lot of music app out there. They all have thing you will love or hate. Give them a try especially the one with free trial. Simply pick the one that work good for you."
328,"Amazon",2016-12-16,2,"This app be so bad that I may not renew my Amazon Prime! This use to be a great app. Now it suck to use on a computer. It take too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different type of music my play list and station or other playlists. Also the logo for Amazon Music make it seem like it have nothing to do with Amazon. I be listen to Pandora at this point. I would have give it a 1 but I like that I can download my favorite playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."
329,"Amazon",2016-11-03,4,"I be so glad they bring back the lyric I be so glad they bring back the lyric. I think they be go after the much recent update but then there they be. Although I wish like with Google music when listen to a station you can see the list of song a they be about to play to customize good."
336,"Amazon",2016-05-30,5,"Five star Its great have ton of music and album also of artist;"
338,"Amazon",2016-03-07,5,"Love Amazon Music!!! Love it!!! Excellent music selection from every conceivable genre and no commercial!!! My only minor issue be that two family member cannot stream prime music from the cloud at the same time. However you can still listen to download music / playlists while another stream from the cloud. amaze benefit of the Prime Membership."
342,"Amazon",2015-04-17,3,"pro and con I really like the idea of unlimited music. The problem: it be not unlimited. For the annual fee I expect to be able to stream any music I want. There be limit to the free music. Even old genre must be purchase. The ability to rewind and replay song be excellent and a definite plus over regular stream app like Pandora Milk etc. but the complete freedom of free stream app be a plus over Amazon music."
346,"Amazon",2013-02-03,5,"wont open on Samsung Galaxy II resolve. I be Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. download smoothly icon on the screen open my device store music list. But when I try to open the cloud I get Exception numb 151 and connection error. I follow all the instruction from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open but to no avail. So I have write this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly but not the phone. UPDATE: finally get this to load up and it work fine. now hitch with playback or other issue. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"
350,"Amazon",2016-02-27,5,"Amazon be the good way to buy music period. I think it be the good way to buy music this day. You have a selection of what you be look for then you get immediate delivery via download house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened if you want. Plus no drive store line or tax if you be lucky enough to live someplace that do not make you pay it."
352,"Amazon",2016-06-09,1,"Too much sell Always push to sell us much stuff."
353,"Amazon",2015-09-09,2,"OFTEN have error load STORE it be a bite of a crapshoot whether or not the Amazon Music Store load. It be not a internet issue or a maximum datum usage issue. My phone which be new and have no problem with other app sometimes sit try to load it for 20 minute after which I cancel for datum usage issue. It have a wide selection but if I can not load the store half the time how can I access the selection???"
356,"Amazon",2017-06-26,5,"The good music app out there! great app! All your favorite song no add unlimited skip and replay. do not ask you if you be still listen. Just another awesome addition to your Amazon Prime account"
359,"Amazon",2016-08-09,5,"absolutely amaze I do not know how they do it absolutely amaze. Leave it to Amazon to come up with such a great service for Prime member. I admit I have a eclectic love of all type of music. I love all type and when I go to look for it sure enough it be there. Thank you Amazon for Amazon Music a it have become a favorite"

383,"Amazon",2017-09-14,5,"Five star great!"
384,"Amazon",2017-05-02,3,"Indefferent so far but it keep ask for a review.... I can not give it much much but try to learn how to use it good. I be use to other music app and this be very different. I will give it a month to see for sure"
389,"Amazon",2017-07-29,5,"Five star Great app!"
398,"Amazon",2015-09-29,4,"I love the mix music selection they offer its almost like... I love the mix music selection they offer its almost like iTunes Match only good.

Performance wise it just suck. No nice way to put it. I be search for a song through the app force close mad. attempt to play the song through via cloud time out and either prompt for a force close or ask to wait. seem to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulty of have to make the app compatible with the different device. Like a computer you can run window but depend on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That say I hope they address the performance issue in the near future.

Then you need to get this. it be a good design program for get your Amazon Music purchase to your phone. And the player be... acceptable. It play music and do not glitch up try to do it. However the much you use the player the much you will find it be not all you want. you will listen to a album and then it will just stop; it will not keep play to the next album in your library. The interface be straight forward but just slightly off somehow. you will want to do one thing and you will accidentally do another. you will never have a MAJOR problem with the medium player but it be not the perfect answer. If you want something with ton of option and personalization look elsewhere for your music app. If you be look for a way to get your Amazon purchase to your phone and a perfectly acceptable player for that song stop right here."

If I be not pay for unlimited datum this bug would have cost me a few hundred meg in overage charge. I try pause the active download but the application keep chug along give me no way to STOP the download. The application can not be trust to do what you tell it to do. A search through the support site reveal Amazon have no apparent plan to fix this problem. If you install it be sure to have a unlimited datum plan or you WILL eventually get hit with a large datum overage charge from your mobile carrier.

The app itself do not indicate that any download be happen or eminent. I hate everything associate with Cloud. Compare the Audible App which work in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download it start the download and give you a progress bar. What the hell can be much simple? But that be too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blow.

Now that I be routinely play music and add or delete individual song from my library etc. my impression be that much think and plan go into the design and functionality of Amazon Music than the other option I have explore. it be very intuitive; graphic be very professional and consistent; it be very responsive I have not yet anyway experience any lag or technical glitches; there be no annoy behavior by the app to aggressively encourage you to buy music unless you have express that interest; and one feature I really appreciate no ad pop up or otherwise. Quality of stream be excellent. My impression be that Amazon wisely realize that this app nicely integrate with their business model and complement their core mission; that be if the app work good and people have a very nice experience it become a very sticky service i. e. enhance loyalty and overall impression of Amazon and encourage much people to join or continue their membership with Prime.

And I be a Music Unlimited subscriber! Amazon Support virtually useless. it be a vicious yet very polite circle of get absolutely NOTHING do.

After a few week of listen to my music offline which be a mix of purchase prime and my own collection of CD song the player start skip over certain / random purchase Prime song. Of course they be the one I listen to the much. flashback of digital right usage? clear the cache do nothing sync do nothing.

The option to download the cloud playlist do not work past 1 to 3 song. transfer a large music library from my computer be good do directly on the SD card with a card reader a the USB cable option hang up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchase music result in duplicate on the device. Oh sure I remember which one be which since the last century.

It be quite obvious that Amazon Prime Music cater to the white middle class mom demographic with the layout and the selection of music. a a millennial I be definitely much draw to Spotifiy's playlists and classification for genre. I have a feel I will grow to love Amazon Prime during my 1 year subscription. However I be turn off by my initial observation of the main demographic to which Amazon cater. So far I be thoroughly enjoy no ad and the option to download playlists album and song to my library to listen to offline. That be a big deal for me since I have a small datum plan and limit access to Wifi. I be definitely will to tryout a much a I can on Prime during my first year of pay access. At this point in time a a business woman and a graduate student I feel that the dollar 50 / year student membership fee be not worth it and much definitely not the regular membership fee."
11726,"Amazon",2014-06-14,2,"Bug ride release! I be very excite when I learn that Amazon have decide to allow stream of much of the popular music for Prime member like me but my excitement do not last very long when I find several bug and limitation in this Amazon Music app for Android. grant it be too early to comment a the app be new but certain basic concept be flaw. The much important for any phone or tablet be the limit space one have for store music file and since this app save music for offline listen into default internal memory and no way for the user to select where to store it External SD card it be very limit on how many song you can save on the limit internal storage. It be never practical to be connect to wifi at all time on a portable device to listen to music from the cloud storage it be also not practical to stream use your datum plan all day so currently the app be flaw. I be sure eventually Amazon will release update to fix this until then I have really no use for it on my phone and tablet. Also there be numb of bug and much notably the app give a lot of exception error and ask to contact customer service and the download song do not play. Even kill the app and restart do not resolve the issue. Currently you cannot listen or re download the song till you clear your cache of this APP. If it encounter download error Which it do on a regular basis you have no choice but to again kill the app clear the cache and re download again or try again and again which be very frustrate. Also the album art go out of sync when shuffle. The Song title do not match with the song it be play The album art disappear when you be not online on certain song the Equalizer do not seem to have no effect and the list of bug go on... It be indeed a nice offer from Amazon to allow unlimited stream of popular song to Prime member but this APP should have be the first thing they must have pay much attention and get it right a all that effort that they have put into cloud service for stream music be worthless without a proper work APP. I be rate this with 2 star currently but I be positive Amazon will improve this in the future and I will revise my review accordingly. thank for read my review."

But the problem be when you do not have solid datum coverage or wifi like in a tunnel or in a build with thick wall. a it try to sync the app freeze and you can not do anything but force close it. Ideally there should be a option to sync only on wifi or manually by press a button. I have several album download / cache locally and never stream. So the app should just play that local album and forget about try to sync any other song I have in the cloud. Sheesh. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ I download this app to take advantage of the Prime Music. it be actually not a bad app even if you do not have Prime or do not purchase music. It recognize / play non DRM music that be already on your phone. I find the interface to be simple responsive and not annoy. I like it a little much than the Google Music app. And it be much good than all that free app that either have limit feature or annoy ad unless you pay up. I will also echo my complaint here about not be able to store Prime / purchase music on the SD card. it be really strange. You can move the actual app to SD card but not any of the music. In a perfect world we would have unlimited / reliable mobile datum everywhere we go and can stream music on a whim. But the reality be we still need to download / cache locally to our mobile device.

The reason for the loss of one star be that 1 You can not store music on a SD card and 2 You can not sync playlists from the device library to the Cloud. Otherwise it be a very good music player.

The correct album art rarely show song take FOREVER to load even when they be on my device! I can hit the 'skip' button a dozen time and the song will not change although the song title text and album art will!. It also run MUCH slow than the previous version.

Last fall I cancel my Spotify subscription think Amazon's Prime Music service have to be at less decent enough consider I be already pay for it. good I be wrong. My husband have already declare it suck!. But I do not listen a often and I have much mainstream taste in music so I figure it should be good enough for me but no. Here be a short list of why I do not like it; The avaiable music be nowhere near other top music service. The app be horrible. So much so that even though it be essentially free since I pay for the ship and video much than anything I would rather just listen to music I have already purchase than use the slow difficult to use app. The app be quirky and constantly lose connection or repeatedly need update for a new version or just plain will not recognize stuff I add to my playlists via the cloud. Plus it seem like a lot of the song that I want to listen to be re record version by the artist that sound like a cover version of the song. I have not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. what be the deal with this scam? In short if you be not a regular music listener this may be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song good luck if you can find it on Prime Music. But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or work out or want to listen while do housework find something else."

Honestly the only reason I care for Prime be the ship benefit but when they decide to attach video again not a good a netflix or hulu and music to it and double the price I cancel my membership renewal.

The Amazon Music app have become my app of choice for access the library of music on my phone and also music in my Amazon cloud storage. What I love about this app be it also provide access to ton of Prime music which be free to that with Prime account. I love the station and playlists. I use them when work out or when I be out for a bike ride. I select a station or playlist and I be on my way. Amazon select a very nice collection of music to keep me company. The station gear musical selection around the sensibility of the artist choose. So the Jimi Hendrix station for example play artist who be in the same general musical family a Hendrix. Amazon also toss in a few Hendrix piece too. There be hundred possibly thousand of station and playlists to choose fromMy only criticism relate to get a feel for how the app work. It take me a little while to figure out how to access the library on my phone and how to flip between my device music and my cloud music. Be careful of this! If you have save your music to your phone and want to listen to it on your phone be sure you have select Device! If not it will go to the cloud to stream. you will eat up datum do that.

When I listen to music at work I usually have my phone charge which mean the phone be on its side horizontal make it hard to easily see and scroll through the app when it do not rotate with the orientation of the phone. After the update to this app it be crash several time on my Galaxy S5 in the middle of a song... do not know why just shut itself down. On the other hand the app will not quit when I try to shut it down. First off there be no sign out or exit program in the main menu. The only way I can easily find to quit the program be by drop down my phone's menu of run application the quick menu and there be a little x to close the Amazon Music app. Only about 10 percent of the time do this x button work. Sometimes it will look like the app close but when I turn my phone off then back on the app be back on my home screen. The only true way of completely close this app and stop it from run on my phone be by go to my phone's application manager and terminate the process for this app that be a completely unacceptable mean of close a app IMHO. there be no option in setting that prevent the screen from go to sleep. Again when listen to music at work I like to keep my phone on and see what be play easily skip through song and choose what I want to listen to. Unless I go to my phone setting and turn off the screen sleep option the phone go to sleep. So every time I want to change song I have to wake the phone up unlock it and change song.

Music playback often skip. This last issue may be android's fault a I have notice it in other player though never so badly a in the amazon one. However I do not experience the other problem in different music player. Until Amazon fix this issue this app be still just another dumb music locker that allow you to download song so you can play them with some other application. it be a excite idea and the interface would be excellent if it just work."

KitKat allow a app to use a SD card just not read folder create by other app. Amazon please allow your pay customer to select where they want to store THEIR music. Although it be nice to have the ability to download Prime Music the decision to store the encrypt music in the Amazon Music app datum directory Android / datum / com. amazon. mp3 not only mean that it will be store in internal storage but will also get back up by app like Titanium Backup. If you keep a history of multiple backup file you end up with multiple copy of the same Amazon Prime Music you have download. Since the music be encrypt why not allow the user to select where it be store? bad of all if you need to reinstall the Amazon Music app all of the encrypt Prime Music you have download will no long play and must be delete and re download. I do not know how the Prime Music encryption key be create but it would be appreciate if there be a way to re authenticate Prime Music already download."

I pretty much always play music from my device but I have try the cloud stream on my phone and apart from a slight delay in start to play the song probably due to buffer it work fine. I have both download music from my cloud drive and upload it onto both device and both work great. My one major complaint be that once you create a playlist or add song to now play you CANNOT drag and drop the song to change the order. You have to delete the song and add them again in the order you want. I usually do not use the shuffle feature because I like to listen to song in a particular order if they seem to go together good. On my phone the ability to skip song or pause without have to unlock the screen be pretty nice and I will give them credit that it be innovative. Overall the app have function fine and play music fine but not be able to easily change the order of my song be a huge drawback."

In Pandora when you be first start out and you want to make your own station you can not just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not it be go to show you other song instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you want to listen to and THEN it will give you different song that be similar to the one you listen to. Also another feature I really like be the fact that you can list to either song familiar to your usual song or song that be completely different. This a great feature for people try to figure out their taste in music. I think that the much important feature be NO commercial! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see be in the begin and that be it. Mind you I be not pay or anything like that for no commercial. I can go on and on about this app but I think it be good to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
14493,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-26,3,"it be Okay.. I expect good a lot of hurdle in the set up process. The program line up appear to be heavily skew to a very young listen audience. My own taste be in talk radio opus classical music I prefer Tune In good channel line up for my taste."

Once I get a station on favorite always by mistake it be futile to remove it from the list. Know what? I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trip what do I need this for?! Just much headache. The geeks that build this system need to make them much user friendly to that of us who do not sit hit button all day long. Lastly there do not appear to be enough station I like i. e. liberal talk radio and traditional country music.

I be look for a all in one app something like iTunes but they do not make iTunes for my device and this one come close to the mark. You can listen three way: Upload all your own music Purchase music from Pandora Listen to unlimited free music in the form of radio station The feature I like the much be the Radio Station maker. You can make custom list of song that Pandora will play in sequence and it do NOT have to be music you already own or have to buy. For example if you like a specific genre of music you can choose that search feature Pandora will go out and grab music that fall into the category and make you a radio station of it. If it bring in a song you dislike you click on skip button and it will be discard from your station. You can also rate song so the app will learn what interest you. You can make other radio station and keep the many different station you make in a library by use your own music or by combine yours with Pandora's. You can make radio station of a single band specific genre's or many other different way. it be a great app to find music you be think about purchase and listen to all of it first or to find music you haven't hear yet from a band you love and even find other band you have never hear before base on music you like. The app come in a free ad base version the ad's be NOT annoy and relentless or you can get a pay app. The one I use be the free one and you barely notice the ad's and infrequent short commercial. Great music listen software!"

There be not any way to skip or pause the music unless you once again physically open the app. You can only see what song be play and the band who perform it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There be some minor issue with song randomly pause half way through and then skip unannounced and without prompt to the next song.

I have to completely shut off the Kindle to get it to quit. Hopefully Pandora will soon fix this mess so I can enjoy music on my Kindle Fire. Two star because it do in fact work on other tablet.

I only receive my Kindle about 2 week ago and be already get lot of repeat song which should not be happen so soon with all the zillions of song out there. Also when I click on the Beatles station I get a lot of music before Beatles music happen. Yes I be on shuffle but I think when I be on a station I would hear at less a lot of that music. But the short loop be my primary dissatisfaction. I haven't update to the no advertisement membership because I do not mind them. I think perhaps if I do upgrade I would get a long time between repeat song but that be not what no ad mean so I be not sure that would solve the problem."

In my case I create several 'radio stations' base on performer such a Simon and Garfunkel. I know S and G have record many song but only hear three or four of them along with a lot of other performer music that be of only marginal interest to me. If you skip too many song you get a message that be not allow a often a you like. I also find over the two month I try use it that much of the music be from album record at 'live' event I prefer the high quality studio song I do not seem to have any choice in the issue.

42050,"Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly Pandora use to have a nice interface. Now it spams you with alarm notification and ad that must be manually close. You have to go through 3 screen just to close the program. It do not support the menu button. It turn on and off randomly so you can not let it idle in the background. Perfect now after I have be bluetooth stream in the car leave the car and let the app shut itself down it will wake up on a whim at a random time and blare music. When I be in a meet or library. Awesome.... Fix your app Pandora. There be no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance. I know that I would never pay for premium this issue."

43229,"Pandora",2014-11-03,4,"Good free music app with lot of variety Not a bad free music app. You can select album artist etc to listen to. Shuffle all of them or choice just tone to play. You have no control over specific song though. Also they throw 'similar music' onto the station you be listen too. Sometimes it be great other can be disappoint. However if you want only the one album of specific song this do not work so good. If you do not like wha this play you be limit to how many song you can skip. And there be a fair share of ad interruption. The other downside be that it take a bite ti shut down the app and be constantly send update notification and thus far I have not figure out a way to stop them. But regardless this be free and can still be great. I use this on my phone and kindle so that when I be clean exercise or outside I can enjoy my favorite music and overall there be little interruption here than on a live radio station. They have a good variety of music on it but seem limit to US artist so far mostly."

One may assume that since it ask you to enter a artist's name to create your own personalize radio station that you will be listen to that artist on say station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you have likely never hear of and that have nothing to do with the artist you enter. If it allow you to enter artist you want to hear song by and then actually play song by that artist and only that artist I would no doubt give it a high rank. The commercals and skip limit just make it all the bad. In short if you be picky about your music look elsewhere. This be not go to give you many real option for customize your personal station. sign Pamela T."

It be a little mislead though a I think it be a full app for the TV. I expect it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this work be that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It work but I do not like that I need to use a 2 device to change the song etc. Also sometimes the connection be not stable even when the internet connection be perfect. For the much part it be okay but I think app can use some work. I do test this product out myself and give a very honest review.

The info say that Spotify get to know what you like but I have zero Abba song and nothing like that on my playlists but yet what song do they inject right after the 3d song on my playlist? Some idiocy by Abba of course. I suppose I be too optimistic in hope that Spotify be like use your MP3 or iPod. I guess they have to make money somehow.

57645,"Spotify",2015-09-18,5,"spotify be the good With a almost surprisingly large catalogue there be something for everyone. You can discover or rediscover all kind of great music. The app run great I haven't have any real problem. The only problem I do have be with some of the artist pull their music but I can not really fault spotlight for that. The ad for the free version can get a bite annoyingly repetitive at time but it be not so bad. Personally I find pay for the upgrade version be HIGHLY worth it especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only be it ad free but you can listen to music offline which be great for thing like long car trip."

Only fault be that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain song when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limit amount of skip but much it seem than Pandora. They have all the song I want. Even the much unknown to the people around me.

The ad do not bother me too much. Then the new update happen. Now its the exact same a the phone version. I have always hate the phone version for a reason. There be basically no freedom on it. I already have to limit my time on Spotify because this tablet only connect to wifi but now I just do not want to use it. There be no harm in keep this version the same a the computer. Profit be not a excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you a a company be cripple artists' profit at the same time. I would rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price be a lot much reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I be really encourage you to change it back because I guarantee that you have lose many user to this and you be just go to lose much. I use to recommend Spotify to people but now my view have change.

First of all you can find almost anything on it from music to even thing like guide meditation or audio book. So it be the first place I search when I hear about a new artist or song. Or if I be look for a old song or a artist I use to love but lose track of over the year. And lot of people from celebrity to critic will post special playlists you can choose from a good. I be constantly read article that send you to a new playlist worth check out. I also love be able to use download playlists offline if I be drive or fly too. The app itself be pretty foolproof though sometimes search can be a little bite tricky. And you still can not alphabetize your playlists which get messy..

But I can create playlists which be a step up from many site; not just I like this band play me their channel and similar song / artist but outright putting song in order on a list with the capability to shuffle. a per usual with free radio site I can not find a few of the song or artist I want and annoyingly some song only come a excerpt like Lady of Shallot which have 5 version on this site none of which include the full song."

You can easily access all of your option and it play clearly with very few issue. One of the issue be that if you have to pause your song for a little while you often time come back to the app say you be not connect online. I always check and be always connect. click back until it kick you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track. Also sometimes when play for a long period of time you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffer and will not play. I tend to just go back to my playlist or songlist and try another song. Other than that I really like the app and I find it to be the good out of all of the music app Pandora IHeartRadio etc. out there."
