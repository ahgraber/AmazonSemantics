6,"Amazon",2015-08-17,1,"Not happy In addition to the ridiculous list of thing it want access to this app would not let me log in to my own Prime profile. It keep log me in under my mother even when I put my own email and password in multiple time. She do not have Amazon Prime or any of my music so all the music I just save to my library apparently be now worthless. I guess I just go back to Spotify. At less that be a lot easy to use and let me log in to my own profile."
11,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Not bad consider its free! Decent service. Love the fact that it be bundle with Prime. make prime a even great bargain! The service itself be.... useable... The music selection be not a vast a other service and the audio quality for some reason be only so so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline that be must have for any music stream service. Hopefully artist and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscriber but I would not mind pay a extra few buck a month if the issue note above be address."

84,"Amazon",2014-06-23,2,"Prime Music need Work Much like the prime video selection the prime music selection be small and include mostly old music. While it generally work okay for the music it do have I be unable to find any way to just search the music that be available through prime music and not for purchase on the amazon store so almost every time I go to listen to a song it be go to charge me. If you be able to limit the search and list of song to only that available for free I would have give it a high score but at the moment it be a lot much frustration than listen pleasure."

99,"Amazon",2013-01-09,3,"Great concept wish it work good I love the Amazon Cloud service and I store my entire music library on it. Unfortunately my experience with it have be inconsistent and disappoint. I have a iPhone and if I use the app on there for much than about 5 minute it lock up my phone and it can take a full minute for it to respond. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab and for some reason Amazon decide to eliminate the ability to browse my library by genre. That may not seem like a big deal for some people but it be huge for me. Really make the app useless unless I know exactly what I want to listen to. I realize there be competition issue between Amazon and Apple and Amazon and Google but this inconsistency and poor performance be a real let down from Amazon."
100,"Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually work good This app work great... Until it crash. Usually it have to shut down a couple time a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crash that mean no much good Amazon Prime music. When it work I be very please though. When it do not good I always keep a CD in the player a back up."

The selection be a little scarce but it be new so I be sure the selection will increase in time. seem that Amazon would put much effort in their prime video service which be still very limit and lack the selection of their competitor instead of launch additional service. Just seem a little backwards to me but I will not complain about something free!!"
109,"Amazon",2017-03-03,5,"It be great! I adore this app. It be great!"
115,"Amazon",2017-06-27,4,"Four star eewf"
118,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"It should be free to download Some song to download you have to buy so again whats the point of be a prime member? Amazon be try to squeeze every cent out of us."
119,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"So very satisfy.. If you have prime use this! My musical taste be vast. If you sometimes vary far off the beat path your need will be meet and expand. So very satisfy... nothing be quite a good a be introduce to music you may like and have them hit the nail on the head. Just make sure you be on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tune."
122,"Amazon",2015-04-23,4,"I like it wish it have much Hawaiian Jawaiian flare I love Amazon Prime and now they have add Prime Music I like it for the much part there be a lot of popular song and some new song that I get to listen for Free.

136,"Amazon",2016-06-18,2,"Nothing to write home about. Its a decent bonus but its no replacement for anybof my other music app. The first 3 song I try to find werent in the collection and the app do not play good withy android platform. I delete it."
139,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"good Music App Ever!!! This be my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent update to this app on my Android Phone have me wonder why some of my music be miss particularly music that I purchase and song select for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App update do not negative affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discover that it be Google Play and not Amazon that change my playlists and eliminate some of my favorite song. I have to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app so it can only be download from the Amazon web site. There be many negative review of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it be because of the change that Google Play make to the app on installation and update. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when download by Google Play. When I install this app again from the Amazon web site it be perfect in form and function. No stall and stop and no miss song."
141,"Amazon",2016-10-14,1,"One Star do not work on a note 7"
142,"Amazon",2015-03-30,1,"I should have know Amazon Prime Music / Kindle / Video be too good to be true I should have know Amazon Prime Music / Kindle / Video be too good to be true! Like Netflix RedBox and any of the other like it there be always loophole / limitation. Every movie song book I have try to download it be not include in the Prime package. I can just a easily wait for the book to come out at my local library and read it for free. The same apply to music / video. look like the only thing that I be go to benefit from by purchase Prime be the free ship for my Christmas shop."
146,"Amazon",2017-05-05,5,"Five star Good"
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five star Love it"

167,"Amazon",2017-08-24,3,"Too much like right it be a alright music stream service. My only issue be that its crazy how for Amazon to have all this option such a kindle echo music prime etc. they can not seem to keep up with the update payment information for one Amazon account. It make no sense to me AT ALL."
169,"Amazon",2015-07-21,1,"Fundamental Process flaw 1 When you but a digital album you should be able to download in 1 or 2 click. Amazon force you to load the app wait for the library to update which take some time find it in the library then download it. If the internet be ubiquitous I would not need to download. But since it be not I download first. Please do not make this so hard. 2 Each time I buy something I be prompt to download the app with a pop us that really push you to download the app. I already have the app so quit confuse me."
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five star Pretty awesome access to ton of music include with my Prime membership."
175,"Amazon",2015-04-19,2,"Amazon Music with Prime Music Very obtuse difficult to navigate and select genre which be very limit. I have a even hard time with it on my phone. It also say you can download music if you be a Prime member but I haven't figure out how to do it without pay for the song. If it be possible that be fine but it apparently be not user friendly."
178,"Amazon",2016-10-17,1,"I use to use Amazon music with my Prime account... I use to use Amazon music with my Prime account. Now Amazon will not install on my phone so I can not. Until it get fix I can not give it much than one star."

185,"Amazon",2017-03-14,1,"One Star The music should be free with the prime membership."
189,"Amazon",2016-01-17,5,"Animal need much MUUUUUSIC! Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that song I consider my favorite that really should not be rare or hard to find be amiss from this app... oh good the pro must definitely outweigh the con."
190,"Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"be not that bad The Good: prime member get a lot of free music buy song be easy the quality be also very good like the addition of the lyric. The Bad: sometimes it crash I can not edit playlist without interrupt the music and I see that the app drain a lot of battery compare with other music player. And be a little confuse at first when try to organize your music. I still give a 4 star cause of the free music for prime member. be it be not for that I will give it a 3."
192,"Amazon",2016-01-12,5,"good music app! This app give you access to all of the music that Amazon have. If you be a Amazon Prime member you get access to free music that you can even download top you be device. There be station recommend for you and playlists you can create by add music to your library. it be definitely my new go to for music. it be like combine Pandora and a MP3 player. good of birth world!"
193,"Amazon",2014-11-05,1,"can not download just to my normal music file. Have... can not download just to my normal music file. Have to have extra app just to listen and have to pay to do that when I already pay for prime. Too costly for just stream basically......."
196,"Amazon",2017-03-11,5,"Five star Excellent result."
208,"Amazon",2016-12-25,1,"I think of myself a quite good technicall aware person... but this all be the much horrible one i have ever encounter!!! the bad app for move music i have ever see I be fan of amazon and use alexa with amazon echo a lot but this app be something out of ordinary you really have to make a effort to design app so poor. what i think much people will use this all with their amazon prime subscription be upload music and then listen to echo when need... but whole process be so slow and complicate its not even worth use it. after few hour of try to upload i only manage to make my Echo play 10 20 of my music out of 100s i try to upload. whole process be design to be bad possible user friendly one. i think only person who will understand whats go be the guy who write the program. really hope that thery will change interface of do something with this app. but 5 month pass and nothing. really disappoint with amazon.... a say in the beguile I be real fan and admirer of whole amazon chain but this be just CRAP!!!"

218,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Amazon be Great! stream work great with the echo of my own library. I do not have prime a a buyer but rather a affiliate because my daughter add me but I would guess it would be a good a stream experience a my own library which have the limit of 250 song in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the song to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it come to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
222,"Amazon",2017-02-28,1,"One Star do not work with Nougat."
223,"Amazon",2017-07-19,5,"Why do not you have this? If your a prime member there be no reason not to use music. No interruption all kind of choice. A must!"

231,"Amazon",2016-06-25,1,"Another stupid music app Who need another worthless waste of space and RAM app?"
232,"Amazon",2015-06-05,3,"Clunky UI buggy and uninformative CLUNKY! Yes it do the trick but sometimes I get confuse a to where to look for thing. Want to see album by a certain artist? okay you can do that but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. let us say you be not all that familiar with a artist but want to download or buy their late album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy also! it be also buggy. Several time I have be tell that my Prime track have be 100 percent download. Then when I be on the road with no available wifi the track be not list under my Offline track only under my Cloud track! This have happen on much than a couple occasion. Also when I be listen to Amazon music and do other thing on my phone such a web browse Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background and this be on a 2014 Moto X not some ancient smartphone. The interface be just not friendly at all. If I be not already pay for Prime I would switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat not that its UI be that much good but its selection of subscription base music definitely be."
233,"Amazon",2014-08-25,3,"do not always work I have use this app for a couple of year and have no problem with the app till the last upgrade a couple of month ago when the app refuse to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of call with Amazon Tec support a solution come no close. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon app work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather trouble. All though I be promise to be keep in the loop I never be not that it matter much anymore since I have a different phone"
234,"Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"This app suck This app suck. I read there be not a charge it be free. you right until you try to download a song.

240,"Amazon",2015-01-02,1,"Completely Useless Randomly stop stream. Way good option to stream music. The absolute bad stream music app I have ever use. It constantly stop stream regardless of the device I be use to listen to music. This happen on any network when I attempt to use the device. It even stop on my Kindle. You would think it if be go to work the good option would be on the Kindle but no. I have no problem with Spotify or Pandora ever stop. If I be not a Prime member there be no way I would ever use this completely useless service."
245,"Amazon",2017-01-28,4,"Great App need some improvement. I use this app all the time. Unfortunately it can not be use safely while drive. On my Kia optimum it will not change song by push the up or down on the steer wheel. A voice command / Alexa style function would be nice for search for song while drive."
248,"Amazon",2015-12-08,5,"Love the free music on my pc Love the free music on my pc. Even get it to stream to my Ouya to listen on the surround sound in the live room"
252,"Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffer and stall For some reason the music buffer even when not stream from the cloud. Also it do not transition quickly from song to song. There have be many time that I think my Playlist have end but it be just silent due to switch to another song. There be a decent amount of free music. I be not sure if the ability to use it end when my Prime membership end or not."

261,"Amazon",2013-04-12,4,"A Grandmother with a MP3 App? I listen to music a I take my daily walk. I choose this product because the FM radio app be non functional and at time Pandora be unreliable. The Amazon MP3 app be amaze. it be always there! I like that I can create customize playlists never have one before. The fact that music I buy from Amazon be downloadable to my electronic device be truly slick. I purchasedd a MP3 player for one of my grandchild but the whole thing seem too mysterious and complicate to me. I be not too savvy with app anyway but I be regularly discover some new capability of the Amazon MP3 app. Thank you Amazon for make this free app available to your customer."

However I can play music through Google player or the device's music player. I do not even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often I get a glitch and need to reset my phone.

279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do... I have Rhapsody now so that be what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference be rhapsody be easy and I do not have to pay additional for a lot of the song. The easy to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do video / music / foodway to expensive! / shop but the price and ease need to get good on prime."
284,"Amazon",2012-11-23,1,"steal my dollar After buy some item on amazon I be reward a dollar to verbal song on amazon music I go to buy a song with that dollar and halfway through it say I do not have internet when I be use WiFi I check and my WiFi be fine so I switch to my 3g and try it again and it still would not download.

289,"Amazon",2015-05-18,4,"LOVE this app a a Prime member this app be pretty much a essential on my phone and Kindle Fire. I love create playlists and have find a lot of great music to listen to for free. I would recommend this over Pandora my previous favorite any day! I wish that it would recommend music a I love to discover new artist but so far I have make it work by cross reference a certain song with what other have add in playlists contain it."
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what be free and... I have yet to figure out what be free and what be not. get really scare off when I download a playlist and it say 60 song buy? try reach out to Amazon but never receive any reply.

305,"Amazon",2015-01-29,1,"why I need to change phone's language to use this app? Dear Amazon USA be a international country with people speak on much than 6 much common language. Android thank to Google folk kind of think of this so Android system be adjustable for any of much than 50 language. I do not have any problem with and numb 34; ONLY ENGLISH and numb 34; program work just fine on my and numb 34; RUSSIAN and numb 34; phone but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music be relate to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? be I suspect not fluent in English if my phone be on different language setting? C'mon Amazon make yourself not limit to English Spanish German French Italian and Chinese if you want to promote sell stuff like music your competitor Google Music do not have such problem.

318,"Amazon",2016-10-28,5,"Music for everyone! I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon have a lot. I absolutely love the fact that it be commercial free. I be overall happy with it. Unlike slack and iheartradio where you be limit in use Amazon music give you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear."
319,"Amazon",2015-02-06,3,"mediocre music service I will vote in the mediocre a okay because that be all it deserve.

1664,"Amazon",2016-12-23,3,"Not too bad... Overall this app be competitive with Spotify and Play Music and definitely blow Napster Formerly Rhapsody out of the proverbial water. It do have its pitfall however. The big of which be the fact that MP3s you have already download will be miscategorized. Also I have find that although the option do exist to download play list the song will not show up in the download section. Secondly the music you purchase be not transferable across other platform. Simply put of I purchase a song outright I feel it be my right to download say song in a universal format such a. MP3. User interface be easy to navigate and I have yet to come across a artist that be not in the Unlimited category. Anyway I give it a try for 1 week and have decide to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra dollar 2 per month be worth it."

The only thing I like about this app be it make my music available. give the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They do just recently add a scroll where I can look for song by their name and actually tell what letter I be near before it be just a guess game. The app really work good on WiFi and be spotty otherwise. It do not give me the option to listen to music base upon the genre So I be normally listen to all my music at once and skip a lot of song. If I search for a artist it do not let me play all song with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This be why I only use this app if I will be in the car a hour or much. It take too much time to work it otherwise. So I still be stick with a limit selection of music that can fit on my phone."

I have find around 10 album on Prime that I do not already have so I can listen for Free and see if I want to buy them permanently. I can organize my Prime music into playlists on my desktop and listen to them on my phone. Download for listen offline be great. Connect when on WiFi and I can still listen on the road without use datum perfect! good than Pandora. This be about the only positive point of the actual App... THE BAD: download / find my purchase Amazon music be much hard than it should be. I want to be able to separate it from the Prime music but I do not see a way to do that. Storage of offline listen music can not be move no option for it... do not resume play once app be shut down. This make it a terrible music player. I do not really want the app run all the time but that mean I need to remember where I leave off... This alone be worth 1 star. I do not seem to be able to hide anything from it...

I try email customer service and get no help. I do call and do get to speak with a rep who inform me there be no exit button in quick fashion. thank that answer my question. That be all I want. The whole thing be that every other music app I have on the phone have a Exit button available in it be menu. Sky Fm? Sure. Winamp? good believe it do. Free Radio? Sure do though it can be a bite clunky at time. Heck even Anime Radio have a Exit button that shut down the app. But this app? no! That be a serious flaw. cause me to get rid of the app. It take use the Unistall menu option rather than just drag it to the trash can but at less it be now go. And good riddance.

No way to perform a multi select of artist / album / track within the library have to perform action on each one individually add to playlist / remove from library etc. much setting need in the poorly populate 'Settings' screen such a: specify download location specify which folder to scan for exit music disable device scan"

Last fall I cancel my Spotify subscription think Amazon's Prime Music service have to be at less decent enough consider I be already pay for it. good I be wrong. My husband have already declare it suck!. But I do not listen a often and I have much mainstream taste in music so I figure it should be good enough for me but no. Here be a short list of why I do not like it; The avaiable music be nowhere near other top music service. The app be horrible. So much so that even though it be essentially free since I pay for the ship and video much than anything I would rather just listen to music I have already purchase than use the slow difficult to use app. The app be quirky and constantly lose connection or repeatedly need update for a new version or just plain will not recognize stuff I add to my playlists via the cloud. Plus it seem like a lot of the song that I want to listen to be re record version by the artist that sound like a cover version of the song. I have not run across this with Spotify or Google Play. what be the deal with this scam? In short if you be not a regular music listener this may be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song good luck if you can find it on Prime Music.

I also wish the selection of stream music on Amazon be good. This be one place where iTunes and their radio service have Amazon beat. One thing that make Amazon and their Prime Music service stand out from the rest be when we get free digital copy add to our prime library when we purchase cd on Amazon. Now I do not have to wait for the CD to arrive and rip it to get it on my portable device. Sometimes you can find album for sale at a cheap price on CD than if you buy the download only version. I also like the stream Prime music library. it be like listen to the radio and we can eventually purchase the song we like so they can be play offline or after they be remove. I suppose this will be treat like the Prime Instant Video service where tune that be once include with our Prime membership will suddenly become purchase only.

Before you can listen to song you must add them to your library which then force you to go to another screen to listen to them. What if you just want to listen once? The mobile app do not allow you to search by Artist. SERIOUSLY? They need to drop the shop cart idea and take a good look at Google music.

I have a approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay around 1 / 3 of them be DRM protect. While my wife be happy to purchase a iPhone I would like to listen to my pay music on my computer AND on my Droid. Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allow me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid desktop computer or laptop computer. All of this for the same price and often cheap a iTunes. I be also a participant in Google Music Beta but have find the Amazon player to be much to my like. Not only do Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive be a free service. I do not realize until recently that the storage for music purchase directly from Amazon MP3 be not include in the 2 GB quota that be provide for the free cloud service. I be also suspicious of Google's music beta. do not get me wrong I love Google and Google product and they have a track record of provide free service that offer alternative to current pay service often at potentially expensive cost to the company while upset competitor. However the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that say Free for a limit time... make me nervous that they be wait for people to upload their entire music library become dependent on the service and then start charge a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth. But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your heart content without worry about run out of cloud storage space or hide or future cost.

I think it even autobuffers the next song which the above app all fail to do despite claim it a a feature. There be a few feature that would make it way cool though: 1. Unify cloud music and device music. This can be replace by a simple icon for one or the other and would make it easy to see what you have on each without flip back and forth. 2. Be able to access your wishlist / shop list from the app. buy music and have it available instantly in cloud player be awesome but it be a pain to have to go to Amazon. com to pick up the album that I have already save in my list. 3. Fix the uploader application for window. If you do not use iTunes or WMP it have to crawl your hard drive and that result be organize by folder rather than tag and on drive folder structure be not preserve which make it excessively difficult to upload all album by a give artist."

There be so many thing I like about it but it be good to start somewhere simple. In Pandora when you be first start out and you want to make your own station you can not just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not it be go to show you other song instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you want to listen to and THEN it will give you different song that be similar to the one you listen to. Also another feature I really like be the fact that you can list to either song familiar to your usual song or song that be completely different. This a great feature for people try to figure out their taste in music. I think that the much important feature be NO commercial! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see be in the begin and that be it. Mind you I be not pay or anything like that for no commercial.

25723,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-24,5,"Fantastic and Much good than Pandora! I be tell to try iheartradio once Pandora start be a butthead. While Pandora be great it start randomly shut off on my phone can take forever to load one song or have a ad literally every other song. So I try iheartradio. Why not? it be free. And man be I glad I do! You can make your own station just from say what one song you like which be what I want and you can tell it whether you like or dislike a song so it will tailor itself to what you like. You get a ad when you first start your app and then it play smooth and a long a you want! I think my favorite part be that you can pin your favorite station straight to your home screen. I have a Android phone so I can not say that it happen on window or Apple product but I love just have to press the one button and have it open the station I want. It save me a button press and let me just press the button and lock the phone to get to work. I think the only con for this app be I can not listen to stand up comedian and I can not figure out how to make a Broadway musical station. For that I be stick with Pandora but I can deal with that. I do not listen to musical and comedian a much now that I have iheartradio anyway. It have only randomly shut down once but it be play for three hour straight so I do not think it be a app problem. it be smooth do not take long to load and offer lyric for nearly every song!"

25792,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-04,5,"I just love this app I just love this app. I put on my favorite station while I be exercise and the time just fly. I love The Beatles station which be what I happen to listen to while I be on the elliptical and the mix of song they play be fantastic. I guess I can only speak for that station at this point but for that one alone it be worth the download. I also listen to some of the talk show but there be a lot of break in the show for commercial about the show itself. I do not think it have anything to do with the app because I have listen my favorite show on regular radio and there be A LOT of commercial break. At less you do not have to listen to commercial commercial but it be still frustrate. I will have to explore some much music station but so far I can not be happy. I hope iHeartRadio keep The Beatles station. They be show it a celebrate 50 year of their music so I be wonder if the station will disappear at the end of the year. I sure hope not."

The limitation be that this be pretty mediocre program. I be not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music be program. No matter what the genre corporate radio manage to play music that all sound the same. Since radio play homogenize sound record company record music that all sound the same. Pretty bore stuff. To be fair I have not sample every single radio station offer on this app. I be familiar with the local station typical of the music describe above and what other station I have sample seem to have the same program.

I will probably play around with the preference within the app to see if I can get much station to audition but I be not hopeful. At less the app and the usage be free so I have only waste my time at bad. Note I think each radio station have to have a unique call sign but apparently thing have change with the internet age."

Also when I click on Elvis Radio or Beatles radio I want to hear them and only one in 3 10 song be what I want. I have learn you have to program the station to eventually play what you be want to hear. I think Elvis radio would play Elvis. No so. the first 10 song you may get 3 Elvis then not again for 10 or much song. BOO! It be a fun oldie station but not what I be expect. I be work on program it now but take a while. Same with the other station Beatles etc."

The app lack the ability to add much artist a seed. The interface be fast. Too fast. If you be not careful you can end up ban much than one song because it process a ban so quickly. There be no way to undo it if you do. If it be not for the good implement stream from real station I would give this app a 2. But the custom station aspect of the app be not useful.

You think to yourself Wow finally a radio station that can accomplish what no other radio can even dream of. You two meet frequently; multiple time a day in fact. You start dream of all the flexibility and new music you would get introduce to. You mess around with different combination of song artist theme etc until you realize something strange be happen! You start to think the bad... be this too good to be true? Have you be take for a ride and abandon in some place know a the loop where all the music you click like to be constantly be play even on station that you would not expect to hear them on? You start to panic and say good maybe the free version have limitation. So you vacillate between pay for this somewhat weak service in the hope of strengthen it or just abandon it all together. You take the plunge pull out your credit card and go for break only to be deflate deject and send into a downward spiral of self pity and regret. Why? Why Pandora Why?"

Sometimes I get music I do not like and that be not even close to the channel artist and when I down vote them I keep get much of their song. The ad be annoy too to say the less. It can be much good but they have to pay their bill somehow. I will from now on just buy my own song instead. pro: free music a variety of music introduce you to new song or artist you may like. con: very limit not very big on custom tune the channel to your preference intrusive ad every other song irrelevant song often."

You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other way... which be great. When you find a specific station and you click the like button thumb or dislike button it will sort the music base upon what it think you will like... which be great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it select one for you also it be great because if it be a classical station you may love a specific song so you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say have flat major"

In the car I hook up the phone to the car's speaker before I leave the park lot and use my 4G I listen to Pandora a I drive around.

The Kindle that be. However the person who say it be a instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customer... have it right. Pandora be a excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customer: the App be advertise a free which cause the customer to download it only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it there be a fee to be pay. Pandora be advertise a free: download it tell it what you like and you will get the music you want FOR FREE. Not so of course: if you want the music for free you must put up with horrible advertisement. If I like rock n roll it would not be so bad but right after a exquisite soft relax piece of music I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate or house paint or... whatever. ad pop up all over the place. You can not see the album cover for ad. Oh but wait: just pay the price and the ad will go away! The price by the way at this point be not that bad. What I resend be that 1 the station create by Pandora for my like do not play what I want it play what IT want; and 2 I be not tell ahead of time that if I want to actually be able to enjoy the App I have to pay. I have find this to be true of nearly everything I have try on my Kindle. The only thing it be truly good for be read and even then the book be often poorly format load with edit mistake and misspell word. The app be load with ad and invariably end up cost money the customer be not warn about ahead of time. a for Pandora it be very disappoint... I will continue to look for a application that be put together with some sense of ethical idealism one that do not break my eardrum with commercial and lurid pop up ad."

33830,"Pandora",2016-03-24,3,"Use Spotify it be good anyway The issue I have be with the app itself for a Kindle Fire not necessarily for Pandora a a whole. There be certain ad you have to physically open the app for on your Fire to watch / listen to. If you do not Pandora just stop do not play any much music but stay open. There be not any way to skip or pause the music unless you once again physically open the app. You can only see what song be play and the band who perform it from the lock screen or the swipe down menu. There be some minor issue with song randomly pause half way through and then skip unannounced and without prompt to the next song. The ad on this version of the app be long and much frequent than on my Android phone iPod or laptop version."

The issue that I have with it be that when I listen to a Station that I have. They be suppose to play music similar the the title of the station I be listen to.... it tend to play music that have nothing to do with the station that I be listen to. For example. I have one call Loretta Lynn Radio She be classic country music.. I have female singer from that era on there... Like Patsy Cline Kitty well etc.... SO now some one tell me what Michael Jackson's Thriller have to do with country music.?? That be one of the song that they play on the Loretta Lynn Station."

42051,"Pandora",2016-05-16,4,"what be the point??? I love the app but one problem: the comment section. People keep leave chain mail for example say this kiss your hand post this on other song in minute and you will have good luck and people be swear and give out personal information. And I keep say do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen.. And people be just be inappropriate.

You be able to pick a artist or genre and it give you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to little wayne. There a few short ad that pop up in between song. You be able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you do not want to hear it at the moment. This app learn your taste and will suggest song or remove one you do not like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skit or holiday music. If you be look for a good music app this be it."

Another reason for the little than perfect rate be the commericals. I understand the need for them but not much than once every 3 song. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue be buffer. Mine do that a lot right in the middle of the song sometimes."

But then something bad happen when they likely bring in some kid fresh outta college who decide to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all item spread out towards all edge of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it be all center pretty much in the center. Now one have to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function button. Plus for this downgrade in feature and function they start charge much money per month. Plus there be NO WHERE you can call talk or email them about your complaint of concern. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenue anywhere whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel NO refund you just have to wait till your subscription run out. So they recently change it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customer. Maybe it be okay for your cell phone but on a stand office or home PC there be much good option out there I have switch to Amazon Music."

Also it can get a little repetitive. I hear a lot of accoustic or live version right after the original record of a track. It would be nice to be able to skip much song and not have to pay to get rid of add but it be understandable and can be bad with them. They be not a easy to accidently hit a on some app but I do still pay to not have them. I think it be worth pay so I be not interrupt by loud add. That can be kind of embarassing at a stop light."

44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about that ad about that ad no music So when I download this app I find that it be conveniently possible to have it play in the background on your phone. I do not mind the idea of watch ad because it be a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow. But if you ask for music from a certain band it will give you a 1 / 6 chance of hear that band a 2 / 6 chance of hear a similar band and a 1 / 2 chance of hear a band that be nothing like what you ask for. But that be not all; the graphic ad pop up randomly overtop 3 / 4 of your playlist navigation which often cause any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music to send you to another ad. I wish the annoyance end there but for every minute of music you be give willingly or not it give you a minute and a half of pop up video ad a good. try to flip to another song only result in it inform you that you be not allow to skip song if you try much than 3 time a hour and forget useful button like rewind; if you try to tap the track to hear something again it only put a like / dislike on the track. I be unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten second over again mark THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN and my attempt to change the thumb down mark to a thumb up when click the previously list song put a like on its album do not take the dislike off the song and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I do not want to be hear. In essence I waste twice a much time listen to ad and song I do not want to hear than hear music I actually want AND I give this twit my email for that lovely opportunity."

They still probably do not. Thwy let you skip 5 song and say sorry we know you be sucker and pay for this but we be not lerting you hear just what you want. Here be a few song that be free that suck listen to them. Oh you make a Dave Matthews band station? Sorry you will hear 3 then have to change it hahahahahhahaha."

One may assume that since it ask you to enter a artist's name to create your own personalize radio station that you will be listen to that artist on say station. Not so. You will listen to 1 song by that artist and then a whole bunch by people you have likely never hear of and that have nothing to do with the artist you enter. If it allow you to enter artist you want to hear song by and then actually play song by that artist and only that artist I would no doubt give it a high rank. The commercals and skip limit just make it all the bad. In short if you be picky about your music look elsewhere. This be not go to give you many real option for customize your personal station. sign Pamela T."

48917,"Spotify",2016-08-29,2,"disappoint functionality terrible stock playlists / station. be pretty excite to finally nut up for a pay music service after use standard Pandora free since it come out almost 10 year ago. I be attract to Spotify for the offline playback since I lIke listen to music while camp and travel in the backcountry mile away from cell service. I start download all my favorite music make playlists and use the app right away. I be never in love with the radio and browse function a they feel clunky and not very intuitive. But i be make my own playlists so that do not bothet me too much. All be work good until it be not. First the radio and browse function start work even much poorly and then not at all then Spotify would freeze up and I would have to close the app occasionally and restary. Then Spotify would freeze my phone to where I would have to remove the battery to restart. Thankfully I can do that with my phone. It still work fairly good when its actually work but it freeze too often. The soft button to navigate through the feature be too close and mistake can be make too easily for efficient party dj type playback. The stock radio station have a ton of crappy filler music so you need to rely on make your own playlists and I use the app out of service so I admittedly have hundred of song save to my phone which may be cause the freeze still unaccpetable. But that be only half of my gripe. Navigation be awkward and the app be in need of remodel. I think they employ millenials to put together playlists I haven't find a decent one yet. I be truly excite for this app but sadly I much likely will cancel if thing be not improve."

53304,"Spotify",2014-08-14,4,"The sound quality be great not excellent I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality be great not excellent but still a nice quality sound for much song. There be very few song I have not be able to find on Spotify and I suspect that have something to do with the individual artists' license agreement. Unlike other music service I do not have to listen to any song I do not want to and when use the non mobile version there be no limit to the numb of time I can skip song. I merely have to listen to a short around 30 second advertisement after a numb of skip and after listen to a numb of song. The drawback be that some song be not available and you be limit to the numb of skip in a hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app you be good off pay for the membership due to the limit on what be available to listen to on a mobile device and that even include iPads and tablet. Still if you be use a laptop or desktop it be probably the good free music app available at this time and you can not beat the price."

The point of ad be to help sell your product but if it have no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it have fail its purpose. I think you should have ad base on what you listen to even if that mean use people save music to get the idea of what they like. The supply of music on this be great I have find everything I want to find and that be good than other app like Pandora. I get to at less listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album suggest song take from other album and play song from there"

You can not choose what song you want to listen to it absolutely insist on shuffle play and then you can only flip three or four song before you be force to listen to the current song. And I mean force. You can not exit out of the song and pick a new artist nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choice you have the user have to have premium otherwise they can not see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow go to the next song if it be a song you do not like from the artist then you only have two much completely random try before you get what you get and you do not throw a fit. For me though I just delete the app and go search for another music app. Sorry Spotify you just lose a customer.: /"

Other than purely local band and even some of them be here Spotity have even some of the much obscure music I love. It have way much than other subscription service I have try. The quality be fantastic. The only thing I would change be to provide other way to organize music. I also find frustrate that what I listen to on one device be not save to another. I use a lot of device two smartphones a tablet Chromebook and two laptop. Unless I add what I be listen to to a playlist I will not find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listen to on that device. I also miss liner notesBut this be small point to what be otherwise a fairly price service at less for someone like me who listen a lot. The free service be fine for casual listener who do not mind commercial Hey someone have to pay the bill. Subscription service be the future of music. My own vast collection of music be almost irrelevant. I choose album I already own from Spotify because it be just much convenient. I HOPE my favorite artist be adequately compensate when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly work for major commercial artist but that be not my scene. be my favorite get decent micro payment or would I be much supportive if I buy their cd? When I have buy cd I end up listen on Spotify. On the other hand I still buy and listen to lp and their be no digital substitute for them."

Profit be not a excuse. You can expect people to pay for this while you a a company be cripple artists' profit at the same time. I would rather pay for amazon prime than this. The price be a lot much reasonable and I get free music and playlists. I be really encourage you to change it back because I guarantee that you have lose many user to this and you be just go to lose much. I use to recommend Spotify to people but now my view have change.

You do not actually BUY the music so you can not burn cd or make other copy but you CAN have the app on all your device so the music go with you wherever you want. I connect the Bluetooth on my phone to my car's sound system so I can listen to what I want.... and no commercial! You can create your own playlists and fill them with the actual music you want... not 'sounds like' the music you like And the good part be that you can make your playlists available offline so you do not have to have a Internet connection to listen to your music. Another nifty feature of Spotify be the ability to view the lyric of what you be listen to if you want. All the information about the artist be also available if you want to know much about the artist you be listen to. And for that people who be devote to social medium Spotify also allow you to connect with friend and see what they be listen to and you can make your playlists public a good.

One Pandora tend to skip a lot and then instead of just pause the song a 2 or two till it re connect it jump to the next song. get rather annoy. Spotify on the other hand will pause and then in a couple of second continue on with the same song. Two I can choose playlists and download them if I know I be go to be in a place where connection be not very good. Pandora be good for suggest song base on your like. I often use Pandora for that reason alone. But when it find song for me that I like I add that song to my Spotify playlists. 3 and for the kicker. I haven't use Pandora customer service so I can not judge them. But Spotify customer service be ace. I be look for a phone numb to call them which they do not have I find out but that be okay. I use their contact form on their website and they contact me back the very next day. The problem I be have be that my account get hack and PW change. would not have worry about it too much but I have my payment info and of course playlists that I have take lot of time to build. They immediately lock my account to where no one can access it and delete any personal and payment info. Then restore access to me.

I always check and be always connect. click back until it kick you to the main screen will almost always get you back on track. Also sometimes when play for a long period of time you will occasionally come across a song that will be buffer and will not play.

The cost of hold on to the past prevent me from experience the present. And take me back to the begin of my story. So my solution to keep life's background revelation in a cost effective manner be SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allow me to stream Spotify think out the home"

With premium it act just like on the pc. No commercial unlimited skip and you can also pick a song from your playlist and will play any song you choose.

61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I think it would be... When I initially hear that Spotify would be free on mobile / tablet I be thrill. When I see it be not the case on the Kindle I be sad. When I notice today that they would upload anew I be thrill again. Now I be just disappoint. I use Spotify on my computer regularly and I be glad to see that my playlists upload to this app without a hitch. That be approximately the end of that emotion because of the follow: 1. Without premium one must be online to listen. Why be this a problem? Because some of the playlists I import be of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer be offline why be there no option to download say music to the app? 2. One's personal playlists must be play on shuffle. Why be this a problem? good it be certainly not the much terrible thing in the world and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often but if I start to listen and a few song in decide I want a specific song next I can not do that. 3. It like to give one suggest song when one be try to play one's own playlists. It do not have the good algorithm for this. Why be this a problem? If I be listen to The Color Spectrum and it decide to throw a song from Migrant in the mix that be really jar. Besides that its algorithm seem to mainly throw either much of the artist at you No I do not like every album that band have put out. or just lump everything into a few too big category hip hop indie rock country and throw the much random s from say category at you And no new Train be nothing like Of Great and Mortal man.. You only get a small numb of skip if you do not have premium. sound a little familiar yet? Only it be not. Because that other app you be think of have user feedback upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lack that. So this app can play all the song from Migrant at me a thousand time over and never learn that I hate it. Spotify on my computer? 5 star. Spotify on my Kindle? I will stick with Pandora."
