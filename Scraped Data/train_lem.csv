1,"Amazon",2016-03-28,5,"I like it better than Pandora.   love this music app.  great selection.  Better than Pandora. Use it on my Samsung Phone.  Not happy, however, that I cannot seem to get the app on my Samsung Smart TV. I get the Amazon Cloud app but not the Amazon Music App,  (Amazon, if someone could contact me about this, would greatly appreciated)  The Amazon Cloud app does not seem intergrated with the Amazon Music app.....Thanks!"
11,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Not bad considering its free!   Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed."
12,"Amazon",2017-07-23,5,"#mynumberoneusedapp   Idk if I could live without this app!!!!"
25,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Amazon music for Android   I plan to work with it a little more, but so far am not impressed. Too complex. Too many steps involved to listen to music, in spite of the emails telling me was a great offering is available to me as a Prime member. Pandora is much simpler and user friendly."
32,"Amazon",2017-08-08,1,"Shame, shame, shame...   I can't get it to work. It keeps trying to use my UK account instead of my US prime account. Customer service was less than helpful. It's a real shame."
36,"Amazon",2016-11-01,5,"Five Stars   easy to use - great selection!"
37,"Amazon",2016-09-07,3,"It's nice that comes for free but not as good as other music streaming services   It's okay they have a pretty good music selection, that's my expense or at least with the music listen to Spotify it has more options YouTube Red has even more, but YouTube can be annoying because the videos take up a lot of space if you're saving them offline. But its nice that this comes with prime because I would get Prime anyways."
50,"Amazon",2015-04-15,5,"I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movie   I started out by taking advantage of the prime 30 day free trial. I wasn't sure if I needed to subscribe to prime as I don't have a way to connect my phone to the TV to enjoy instant prime movies. I don't have a gaming device. Then as I was learning more about prime music. The rest is history, I am now a prime member. Maybe before my membership runs out I will have some kind of device to view thru my TV.Thanks again.Love Amazon and Prime Amazon.Keep up the good work"
51,"Amazon",2017-04-06,4,"Good all around source for music.   Pretty good availability. Not all choices available (free music)are the original musicians  or versions of particular  songs ,you  probably can purchase them . On my laptop the Playlist is a little hard to edit ."
53,"Amazon",2016-03-23,1,"BB no longer supported   I always gave great credit to Amazon for doing its part to make Android apps available for the BlackBerry OS. No longer. I have reason to own a BB10 OS device, which does have the ability to run Android apps, but only if the vendor allows the app to be downloaded, which in this case Amazon no longer allows. I'm dumping my Amazon Prime subscription and giving the money to Spotify."
54,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Five Stars   perfect"
57,"Amazon",2016-11-15,4,"Works for me!   Works well on my smart phone. Not comparing it to itunes or any other provider As a stand alone  product, I use it with Audio CDs purchased and I can download with prime in 5 seconds. I use it daily no measure of sound quality, etc.Simply works for me. Use phone, open Amazon player, hear my music. Grateful!"
59,"Amazon",2017-06-03,5,"Five Stars   It's so nice!"
60,"Amazon",2017-03-18,5,"Great Product   Great Product"
61,"Amazon",2017-08-23,4,"Four Stars   Quality sound without commercials and good choices. I would like to see more stations posted without having to search."
64,"Amazon",2015-08-20,1,"Bad on a current device, but why would I put this on a current device?   I can't give negative stars, or else I would.  There is no reason this product needs Android beyond 2.1.  The best use for a old phone or device is to put it in a corner as a music player.  But this requires that you be on the most current version of Android.  Useless app.It needs far too many permissions and is a data hog.  I believe that is why they want the more current Android, in order to assure they are on my current device."
66,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Best streaming music service I've found   It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."
67,"Amazon",2017-03-15,5,"Five Stars   AWESOME"
71,"Amazon",2017-03-04,5,"Five Stars   great"
73,"Amazon",2017-11-14,4,"Four Stars   wokks"
75,"Amazon",2017-09-01,5,"Five Stars   Love it!!!! Move over pandora"
76,"Amazon",2016-03-10,5,"Being old... I saw the birth of ...   Being old...I saw the birth of the 8 Track player, the cassette, then the CD, DVD, and now ""the cloud"".  What will  they think of next? Think I forgot about the MP3...not sure where it fits.  Personally I don't have one, least not that I'm aware of.  I should probably ""rent"" a little kid between say 8 and 10.  They know more about this stuff than 20 adults OVER 65!"
77,"Amazon",2017-08-11,5,"Five Stars   Works  great."
80,"Amazon",2017-03-19,5,"Five Stars   good"
82,"Amazon",2015-09-27,5,"Come for the shipping, stay for the free music and movies!   AZ keeps adding more reasons to use Prime. This is one of them. Lots of music to hear for free on a variety of devices.  Come for the shipping, stay for the music and movies!"
86,"Amazon",2017-04-16,5,"Five Stars   Good"
90,"Amazon",2016-11-01,5,"Five Stars   Great music available!"
91,"Amazon",2017-03-20,4,"Four Stars   good"
97,"Amazon",2015-02-20,1,"Not working on my device   I have tried over & over again to get this app to open on my phone.  I keep getting an Account Error ""Exception #45"".  I have reported the problem & get no reply from Amazon customer service."
100,"Amazon",2016-03-18,3,"Usually Works Well   This app works great... Until it crashes. Usually it has to shut down a couple times a week. I like the music on Amazon Prime so I deal with it. But I like to let my phone stream through my car audio system. So when it crashes that means no more good Amazon Prime music. When it works I am very pleased though. When it doesn't, well I always keep a CD in the player as back up."
106,"Amazon",2014-07-03,1,"I know you are not listening, BUT   For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment.  First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality.  This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you.  Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time.  Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want.  I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with.  Very dissapointed.  Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else.  Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy.  Good luck with your new fire products.  Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.  You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them.  You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."
108,"Amazon",2017-03-15,3,"Three Stars   Liked it better before changes."
116,"Amazon",2014-08-02,1,"Uninstalled, because it is of no use to me anymore   Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud'  music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me."
123,"Amazon",2016-01-29,5,"no problem   I don't understand the negative comments. There is a ton of free music for Prime members. Easy to access and easy to play. And I am a grandma :)"
126,"Amazon",2017-11-06,2,"The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which ...   The music / mantras that I like to listen to are on Amazon Unlimited of which I have to pay for. It's o $2 less than Google Music which isn't much of a difference so decided to keep Google Music. Mainly, I don't want to have to go through and reset playlists also."
133,"Amazon",2015-08-09,5,"Five Stars   I just love Amazon Music w/ Prime Music. Can't wait to see what the future holds."
136,"Amazon",2016-06-18,2,"Nothing to write home about.   Its a decent bonus, but its no replacement for anybof my other music apps. The 1st 3 songs I tried to find werent in the collection, and the app doesn't play well withy android platform. I deleted it."
137,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Worst update ever!!!   This was a forced update that if you uninstall it, it removes your amazon app completely.  I lost all of my playlists, and there are a lot more steps to get to the song or album you want.  Too many drop down menus, and too may ads.  And I don't know if this has anything to do with it but my 'desktop' screen has changed and now I have multiple pages to move thru to find what I want.  Hopefully I can take it to verizon and they can reset it."
140,"Amazon",2016-12-31,3,"They will get there one day   Let's face it Amazon can't do everything just yet but we'll on their way. I listen to non mainstream music and they just don't have it quite yet"
144,"Amazon",2014-08-12,1,"Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts.   We have tried using this on several different devices thinking that maybe that the app was just not working with the device (yes, we know only 1 device at time). However, the shuffle doesn't really 'shuffle', the music will just stop without notice, and the Prime music to the computer and the Prime music to the device do not sync.Since this is still a new feature, we will be holding out to see how it adapts."
145,"Amazon",2017-03-06,5,"Love it   I am enjoying my music"
147,"Amazon",2016-10-05,5,"A lot of good music   This even beats itunes! You can get an artist or song with their search!"
150,"Amazon",2017-01-01,4,"Can't remove only the duplicate songs.   Very cool, but there's no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."
154,"Amazon",2017-01-06,1,"Since the last update I can't get the app to ...   Since the last update I can't get the app to work on my PC at all.  The app slows to a death march speed.  I have removed it from my system."
156,"Amazon",2017-02-28,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
159,"Amazon",2016-11-27,4,"I dislike the updated user interface   I dislike the updated user interface. wish it was more seamlessly integrated into my Toyota in dash audio system. otherwise very very happy user."
165,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon music with prime music   I have tried downloading it my 3 units Desk top is OK but does not let me access all my playlistsMy Android only seem to have some of the Albums but mostly singles from the albums listedMy note pad I installed it, then I had a problem so I deleted it now it tells me I already have it loaded but I cannot find the icon to reinstall itAll you seem to want is for me to purchase more music though prime, when I can't play the music I already have loaded"
166,"Amazon",2017-06-14,5,"Five Stars   Greatest thing ever"
176,"Amazon",2017-01-08,5,"Five Stars   Incredibly good service"
179,"Amazon",2016-08-21,5,"Love this perk with prime!   I love being able to stream music free on my phone with the app. This is a great perk for amazon prime members!We stream at home and hook my phone to a cord that runs through the stereo and surround speakers so I can listen while cooking. I also do this in the car.I love all the chanel's offered."
180,"Amazon",2014-07-29,3,"No artist data   When I use with Bluetooth in car  the displayed data is missing artist.  I can see track and album but artist data missing.  This only happens with Amazon music.  Google, songza, milk, Pandora, Spotify all display complete data"
181,"Amazon",2016-02-16,3,"It plays and allows you to choose most songs.   The 500 song limit is cheesy, the radom function is not! Program runs extremely slow when adding songs to playlist"
182,"Amazon",2015-11-04,3,"The Amazon Cloud Player app (on Samsung Smart TV) is not good.   I'm pleased with Amazon Prime Music on my desktop and Android devices, but I'm not pleased with the Amazon Cloud Player on my Samsung Smart TV. The Cloud Player has limited functionality and will not play Amazon Prime music (it will only play my music).Unfortunately 90% of my use of Amazon Prime Music would be via my Samsung Smart TV. Therefore I'm back to Pandora and other apps on the TV."
184,"Amazon",2017-09-22,1,"Waste of time.   Awful! Clunky and not intuitive. I expected way more from Amazon."
186,"Amazon",2015-09-26,1,"IT KEEPS CRASHING... AND CRASHING... AND OOPS... CRASHED LIKE AN 80 YEAR OLD INTO A FARMERS MARKET!   I have this on my HTC one M8 and it crashes every few minutes.  I've used it in the past with no issues but with this HTC one M8 it crashes and then wants me to send a report.  Every time this happens it shuts does whatever other program i am using.  GAAAA! HEEEEEEELLLLP!!!YES I have tried updating (doesn't help)YES I have tried to install/re-install (its factory so there is no total uninstall)"
187,"Amazon",2014-07-04,1,"do not get  this app   I am a prime member and  looking forward to listening to Prime music  in addition to the music I  bought. This app crashed and did some bad things to my Samsung Galaxy S4 tablet. This app does not work.i do not recommend this app."
188,"Amazon",2016-04-06,4,"Nice perk for prime members   For prime members, this comes with a lot of music free of charge to stream to your phones and devices.  I was surprised that there is a pretty good selection of current hit music that is included for free with prime.  I primarily use it for the free music and free Hit Playlists.  Also allows for caching music to phone/tablet memory or external memory card."
191,"Amazon",2014-10-04,3,"Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads   Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads. The Lady Gaga Artpop album I bought was half the price of Google Play app. I also noticed that Google Play matched the price when I went back to compare their price. However, Amazon Prime gift cards in the stores start at $25. ""Whew"", "" Wow""! It's a high price to pay for one album if that's all you need. I don't have a credit card and am on a limited income. What happened to the days of the $10 iTunes card? Overall though it's quite good!"
193,"Amazon",2014-11-05,1,"Can't download just to my normal music files. Have ...   Can't download just to my normal music files. Have to have extra app just to listen and had to pay to do that when I already pay for prime. Too costly for just streaming basically......."
203,"Amazon",2015-07-26,5,"Great elections.   Use it on my phone to have music in the background anytime.  Great elections."
205,"Amazon",2014-07-21,4,"Great, but want more access!   I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can't access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device."
206,"Amazon",2016-07-07,5,"if you're subscribing to any other music service you're losing out   If you subscribe to any other music service and video service like Netflix or Hulu you're going to kick yourself for the price of commercial free Hulu you can get Amazon Prime which includes all the music you can download or stream all the movies you can watch and free Amazon 2 day shipping all for one low price. Fantastic deal"
209,"Amazon",2017-10-16,5,"Five Stars   Good music"
214,"Amazon",2014-07-12,4,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works!   This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. It's a shame because of the amount of music available."
219,"Amazon",2014-11-10,2,"Very disappointed, considering looking elsewhere for a cloud service/music player   Regularly crashes and gives errors, I've talked to tech support numerous times, each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy.  Sometimes I'll play a song from my device, not even on the cloud, and it will take 10 minutes to load.  Other times, I'll open it and it will immediately crash about 50 times until I can finally start to use it.  I've had this for about a year and had to uninstall/reinstall it probably 30 times because of issues."
227,"Amazon",2017-05-01,5,"My Music   I love my music on my phone while work outside."
228,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Good music selection and easy download   Music is easy to save to computer or device. When I downloaded it to hard drive it went to iTunes."
232,"Amazon",2015-06-05,3,"Clunky UI, buggy, and uninformative   CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
233,"Amazon",2014-08-25,3,"doesn't always work   I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
234,"Amazon",2016-12-12,1,"This app sucks   This app sucks.  I read there is not a charge it's free.  Ya right until you try to download a song.  I wanted to download three or four Christmas songs for our song box to make our lights dance.  It's not like I'm trying to create a music collection or something!!!!!!!!!  Gee wiz"
235,"Amazon",2017-10-12,4,"Would be nice if it had a bigger library of songs   Would be nice if it had a bigger library of songs, but download/offline mode is a great option to save data!"
238,"Amazon",2016-01-25,5,"Super Job with Amazon Prime Music!   I am very impressed with the selection and the quality or music!  I have just started using this service,  but from what I can tell---it is absolutely top notch!  An endless selection of artists stations as well.  Great job Amazon!"
241,"Amazon",2017-01-07,5,"Five Stars   Ok"
242,"Amazon",2016-09-30,5,"Love using this app with my prime membership   Love using this app with my prime membership. Amazon has the best play lists and stations and my music sounds so much better with this app than others."
246,"Amazon",2017-01-24,5,"Use It Everyday   I really enjoy the Amazon music app. With the auto-rip feature from Amazon, you get free digital copies of your music on Amazon Music. I also enjoy that I can download songs to listen offline, and that I use SD card storage. Easy to use and very convenient. Would recommend it."
247,"Amazon",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars   very satisfied with this product"
256,"Amazon",2016-01-09,3,"good, but could be better.   The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you  ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it."
260,"Amazon",2017-07-23,4,"Four Stars   like it"
265,"Amazon",2016-02-04,1,"What a waste of a great idea   Unable to use or get use out of it. All of Amazon Prime was so totally non-user friendly that I gave up for the second time and got my money back (again). They need to consolidate some things quickly. What a waste of a great idea. You need to fire your head of organizations. When you fix it, please call me. Signed: wish I could have spent my $105.00 dollars."
267,"Amazon",2016-12-29,2,"Huge battery suck makes great app suck   I love the app when I am using it, but when I am not actively using the app it is still responsible for 25% of the battery drain.  Samsung S7 edge up to date stock.  Fix this unnecessary drain since my guess is the only thing it is doing during non-use is collecting data."
274,"Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Love love love Amazon!   I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
280,"Amazon",2015-08-13,5,"Don't Wait - Get This App Today!   Amazon Music with Prime Music All kinds of music are passions of mine. I am a Prime Amazon member but have to say; next to the two-day shipping that Prime members receive, this is the second best feature offered. I have the app on my phone, my Kindle, and my computers. They ALL work great and I have not had any problems at all with them. The app has ""stations"" that I absolutely love because they are already put together playlists that actually go well together. I can make my own playlists with east on all devices. You can separate each song by album, singer, or genre. The platform is the same on each device which is great - no further learning on each device. I have over 6,000 songs on my app and have used MANY other similar apps from other companies. They do not come close to this easy to use great app."
281,"Amazon",2016-07-23,4,"Lots of new music   The app itself could be easier to navigate, but I'm still going to give it a high rating because if I hear a new song on the radio I have not had a problem also getting to listen to that song on this app for free. Anyway, it's not a perfect interface but they make up for by giving a great selection of music."
292,"Amazon",2014-11-28,1,"I downloaded it to my phone, but it won't ...   I downloaded it to my phone, but it won't open. I keep on touching the ""Open"" button on my screen, and nothing happens. Exteremly frustrated, especially after purchasing a song!"
293,"Amazon",2015-07-31,2,"I like to listen offline   I like to listen offline. Your service requires me to be online to use it while driving, therefore wasting my valuable data. Music downloaded to my library should be available when and where I want it without having to stream it every time. You can do this by requiring the user to update every week or month like other services do. If they don't update frequently the music deletes or locks until they do."
296,"Amazon",2015-10-07,1,"USA issued Credit Card.... seriously?   Music Collection under prime could be better, nevertheless i am happy with it because i don't need my spotify subscription--edit--After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i don't have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."
297,"Amazon",2016-06-14,5,"Beats Pandora!!!   Beats Pandora! You can go back and listen to a song again, skip unlimited, no commercials/advertisements, and it doesn't stop playing with ""are you still listening?"""
299,"Amazon",2015-06-26,1,"I only use this to get rid of my Digital Music Credits....   I've rated this a 1 star because I don't WANT to have to be DRM'd to my music, but I own like five songs here, so I occasionally download it- mainly because I get a $1 .mp3 credit for digital purchases at times so... I get this to pick the song I'll never listen to: Then I uninstall it."
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and ...   I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
303,"Amazon",2017-03-08,5,"Great for any music lover   Love and use it"
305,"Amazon",2015-01-29,1,"why I need to change phone's language to use this app?   Dear Amazon,USA is an international country with people speaking on more than 6 most common languages. Android (thanks to Google folks) kind of thought of this, so Android system is adjustable for any of more than 50 languages. I do not have any problems with &#34;ONLY ENGLISH&#34; programs working just fine on my &#34;RUSSIAN&#34; phone, but somehow in order to listen to Amazon MUSIC I need to change my phone's language to English... How music is related to language? Will Amazon Music program try to speak with me? Am I suspected not fluent in English if my phone is on different language settings? C'mon, Amazon, make yourself not limited to English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Chinese if you want to promote selling stuff like music - your competitor Google Music does not have such problems.

It takes too much time to get to where I want to be and to move back and forth between different types of music (my play list and stations or other playlists). Also, the logo for Amazon Music makes it seem like it has nothing to do with Amazon. I am listening to Pandora at this point. I would've given it a 1, but I like that I can download my favorites playlist onto my tablet and play in my vehicle."

I was disappointed.  It allowed me to download and play one album for free.  However, two or three successive attempts to download albums in the Prime library failed, with only small samples being played before I was offered the opportunity to purchase.Admittedly, I didn't mess with it for long, since the moment called for music (streaming to a Bluetooth speaker) and I didn't want to take the time.  So I went immediately to my Sirius Internet account, which worked perfectly.  I'm sure that Pandora would also have worked easily, since it always has in the past.If I wasn't doing something properly, I would say that the site is not intuitive or user-friendly (at least for this Prime member)."

386,"Amazon",2016-11-14,3,"Great app, but it's got some bugs   Great app. Just a small problem with offline music - online music that I download to listen to offline sometimes doesn't actually ""download"". Even though it's check-marked as downloaded, it won't let me play it and it gives me that annoying ""Internet connection required"". It's happened on my Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and an LG phone. Sometimes the lyrics are not on sync as well, or the art cover gets stuck for one song and the app 'freezes' (it keeps playing music but I cannot tap anything) a bit, then displays it correctly"

Yes, I understand, wholeheartedly, that we are in a new tech era where NO ONE would be caught dead burning, little on, listening to a cd, but Im not one of those sheepish lame ""gotta keep up with everyone"" douche bags... I bought my music. Therefore, I should be able to stream it, burn it, copy it (as long as I don't claim it as my own; youtube). Not all cars are equipped with ipod docking devices. Mine has a good ol fashioned cd player, Thank God, oops, I didnt offend anyone by Thanking my Lord did I? I wouldn't be apologetic anyway. I'm not forcing religion on you.

399,"Amazon",2015-05-03,4,"Gotta do some searching to get it for BB.   I tried to download to my BB via amazon apps and amazon mobile. No luck so, had to use a mirror to download.The app is great, but since it is android and not BB, there is a hiccup once in a while that causes it to crash. Otherwise, the sound quality at the highest level (in a compatible wi-fi environment) is fantastic, and it's better than having to listen to pandora or spotify with their commercials."
401,"Amazon",2014-08-29,2,"Prime Music Service Review   Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for ""offline"" listening.  It seems to me that having more songs streamed to Prime Members wouldn't cost Amazon all that much more money, especially since most of them are VERY old songs!!!  Also, a few more of the newer recordings, or, compilation albums would be nice."
402,"Amazon",2016-01-22,5,"A must have   Great app! I can just listen to music on the run, or I can make playlists and mark favorites as I hear them. My favorite thing is being able to download songs for offline listening. That has to be the best feature."

It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."

Okay, fine, it's only $3.00 but then I couldn't even get the MP3 app to work on my Galaxy 3 Android.  I get error #45, which I tried Googling but got no resolve.

444,"Amazon",2013-03-03,4,"Good Not Perfect   I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet.  Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing.  It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with.  While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices.  An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it.  So far it is working well without too much difficulity."

I have several different categories (rock, classical, country, alternative, comedy, Halloween sounds for trick or treaters, Christmas music for sitting around the house, etc.) and have all of it totally organized in its own category.  If I'm in the mood for country, I'll just scroll to country, hit ""shuffle all"" & hit play & all country songs on my playlist can be heard in no particular order.  Whether it's on my smartphone or on my tablet, it's well worth it !!!"

When I read amazon was going to raise the prime cost I thought about dropping the service, the addition of the music has made me reconsider.

Did you know prime delivered, for free, a college textbook on Sunday via overnight service,  that my daughter needed on Monday. I liked prime for the price. Now I love it thanks to the music."

484,"Amazon",2017-06-29,5,"Good app - as long as you are in a strong wifi zone!   The only real problem I have with this app is more the fault of my smartphone not having adequate wifi coverage where I work, so anything I want to listen to that's in the ""cloud"" is a problem.  Not the apps fault!  Stuff I have saved offline in ""My Music"" that's stored on the phone I can listen to all the time.

Audio quality is excellent, (something one of the other major streaming services does not really care about.)Why is it just okay?  Because it is not superior when it comes to playlists.  The playlists are okay, but short compared to other services.  Not something you can just pick and forget for hours of listening.  Also the choices of genres need to be expanded."

I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I wasn't too worried about having enough music to listen to.

I really don't have to worry about hogging up the memory on the device and I still have an unlimited data plan and plan to keep until I am forced over to capped plan :)Now the bad. Performance wise it just sucks. No nice way to put it. I was searching for a song through the app, force closes =/. Attempted to play the song through via cloud, times out and either prompts for a force close or ask to wait. Seems to be hit or miss right now. Maybe its carrier performance or maybe its app, but if i can stream video via Netflix or Crackle, i tend to point to a performance issue with the app. I truly understand the difficulties of having to make the app compatible with the different devices. Like a computer, you can run windows, but depending on hardware you may not be able to run something someone else can. That said, I hope they address the performance issue in the near future.

645,"Amazon",2016-02-16,5,"It's good.   I was a little surprised. Amazon must have updated some stuff because the first time I tried it I hated it and i wrote it off as a Napster/ITUNES wannabe. I'm kind of a music junky, I need it everyday even if only for fifteen minutes. I'm very pleased with Amazon music. Will recommend to friends."
646,"Amazon",2014-06-30,2,"Issues downloading to device   I like the Amazon music service and the new Prime Music seems like a great idea, but when I discover new music and want to download it so I can listen to it without being connected it doesn't always work and is very frustrating. If they make it more simple and allow music to be stored to external memory card I would be happy and be able to purchase slot of music. I miss the old player so I use the standard player that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3·"
647,"Amazon",2016-01-23,3,"Fee or not to fee....what was the question?   I'm not a fan of annual fees that only provide SOME of the service, and peretual nickle & dime fees for eternity. Either pay as you go or make the annual subscription all-inclusive. Other than that, the music that IS included with the subscription fee is pretty extensive, so I'm kinda just nit picking."
648,"Amazon",2015-07-02,5,"FREE music with no commercials and as many skips as you like...   Awesome app. Love, love, and more love. Gives you the ability to download the playlists and skip anything you want...with no commercials. You can even randomize the playlists, and more. I just turn on Bob Marley's greatest hits by the pool. If you're a Prime member, there's a MASSIVE selection of music that is...wait for it...completely and totally...FREE!"
649,"Amazon",2016-02-10,5,"Great app...works perfectly !!!   Love it.I use it with my local Wi-Fi on my Android.Perfect app if you have AmazonPrime, and thus have seemingly limitless access to titles that span more than half a century, without having to pay for them, which makes paying for the occasional title not seem so big a deal."
651,"Amazon",2014-08-17,5,"Impressive added benefit   Really enjoying this added benefit to my prime membership.  I'm just not someone who will generally pay for music, when I can just turn on the radio.  But I have to admit it is really nice to be able to put together your own playlist and listen to what you like as an added free benefit.  The site has been fairly easy to navigate even for a 50-something guy like me.  Give it a try, I think everyone would find something they like on here."
652,"Amazon",2017-05-31,5,"Love Amazon Music   I love Amazon Music. I downloaded a lot of music and Amazon Music makes it sooooo easy to do."
653,"Amazon",2014-08-10,5,"Essential app to enjoy Prime Music and download free music to your devices   If you are a Prime member and enjoy music, you'll want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings, but you'll need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist, album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."

671,"Amazon",2016-12-21,2,"I Want a Divorce   I thought I loved you Amazon, but it turns out you're just like all the others...No, really, I liked Amazon because it delivered clean MP3's to my phone that I could transfer to my computer using simple drag and drop from the phone/pc directories. This is EXACTLY why I gave up my IPhone and went to Android, to then find out I had to boycott Google Play too, who, as it turns out, is even more insidious at highjacking your music.I just want to buy music and be in control of it. I want to be able to manipulate it. I don't want to use a third party cloud storage system. I trust my own ability to keep my music safely backed up,One last thing - Amazon was awesome too because it didn't conflict with my car's Bluetooth. My car would switch to voice control and back to music seamlessly which Google play never did but the Samsung music player did. Now Amazon, this messes that up again because now I have to get a 3rd party app to unencrypt all of my music on Amazon AGAIN and transfer it to my PC AGAIN, then move it back to my phone to use the stock music player so it works properly in my car.Yep, I'm divorcing you. So disappointed."
672,"Amazon",2015-08-03,3,"Could do better.   Puts songs directly onto device storage. Needs an option for putting music directly onto the SD card. I've been downloading a few songs at a time and transferring them - a slow process. As for Prime music - it seems to hide it on the device storage with no way of moving to the CD card - My phone was running out of storage until I realized this."
673,"Amazon",2014-11-10,5,"Outstanding   Best site for music ever.  I've never had a problem using Amazon Music and with Prime Music tons of my favorite music is free!!  Yippee!"

Loved this app until that, not I just don't bother."
693,"Amazon",2016-01-10,3,"Guess I'll stick with Pandora   Pandora must buffer more or something, because they don't skip like amazon does.. It seems like amazon has to reload the music every time a new song comes on. Not seamless."

699,"Amazon",2015-04-15,5,"Music is music. This, however, is bundlized with other benefits   The music talks! I guess this is a good deal, when compared to, for example, Spotify. You get on-demand, ad-free music, plus other amazon-prime benefits. Part of a bundle deal, if you ask me! Amazon Music is like the added bonus for your shopping experience on Amazon; it seems as if it were already free (but not really). Amazon Music is the cherry on top any ol' cake."
703,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Works great with Alexa and Echo Dot"
706,"Amazon",2016-06-25,5,"Definitely a great perk for prime members   The fact that you can download songs and playlists for free was unexpected.  Definitely a great perk for prime members."
708,"Amazon",2014-03-22,1,"Used to love it now I hate it.   I have been using Amazon exclusively for all my music purchases for years and loved it. Unfortunately, a recent update to all Amazon apps requires them to be linked to one account. Now I have to choose whether to have access to my music and apps or to have access to my Kindle books which are on a separate account. Very disappointing, especially when you consider that Amazon does not all me to merge my two accounts into one. Guess I need to find a new music service."

The ability to make my own playlists is great too because I listen to many different types of music as does my boyfriend. It's extremely user friendly on my Samsung and his IPhone."
729,"Amazon",2015-12-19,2,"Constant buffering   Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason.  No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies.  Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy.  Playlist options are great, love the music.  Same issue on laptop and mobile.  Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."

It's great I my taste in music is much different than most great fringe bands that what I like from metal to country if it's not on the radio it's for me. And when I search my favorite band there that are. Best music app around"
739,"Amazon",2013-07-05,3,"Don't use it, don't need yet another competing source of music   I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying.  Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service.  Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.If they're going to ""DRM"" things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house.  If I ""buy"" an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it.  (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.And of course speakers on phones suck.So, Music?I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another ""source"" of music.I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service.  And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay.  But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.So so so....If you use it, more power to you."

I have been currently (as I type) trying to listen to my music.  It's been 15 minutes and no sound.  It's still trying to load.

There is a wide range of music selection as well, and I love the ability to play my music from an app on my phone to keep the number of devices down to a minimum. I'd recommend the interface needs a little bit of work, as it can have a lot going on at one time. But other than that, good music!"

Some of you might say well, duh! about the cloud player, but having a free digital copy of most of the CD purchases I make from Amazon is too cool. I can listen to those songs on my phone from the cloud player. Wow. Finally a forward-thinking customer service tool that rewards me for my continued patronage.

Looks like the business model is to give you just enough free music to get you to use it, but with holes in collections to get you to purchase more.They do alow you to upload some of your music, but we still have yet to find the one app/service that will have everything.

An hour after launching the program, it came up, indexing the thousands of wav files I use for music production.  Great.  Unchecked the load from windows media player again, the library was back to normal.  Now today, it decided to load the entire WMP library again because it felt like it.

Next time, the danged app kicks up a recommendation instead and gives you ""playlists"" of groups similar to the Doobies. So I'll get my ""South City Midnight Lady"" and the next song will be some other artist.Anyway, just the grumblings of an old geezer. :o)"

I tried one &#34;Prime&#34; song today and it played ok, but if I paused or tried to switch songs it didn't respond, then after several tries it would perform the actions I'd tried in order sometimes 20+ seconds apart, so the track would go back to the start and play for a little while and start over, then it would play a little and switch to the previous track, then after a bit the track before that.  Then about 6 hours after I first got the &#34;Prime&#34; song I tried to play it again and the app said it was no longer available, then removed it from my list. Lame! Plus since this is such a big overhaul of the app it shouldn't have the benefit of a couple of years worth of 3, 4 and 5 star reviews.

I have it downloaded to my desktop and it never seems to work properly anymore, even when assuring updates are all completed. I will select a song from a playlist created and it will never stop. Truly irritated, because it was not always this way. It was once my only source for streaming music from my laptop."
1305,"Amazon",2014-10-14,3,"No SD card support and some recordings not original   I really wasn't sure what rating to apply to prime music, so I settled with it's just OK since the app is not all that bad (lacks some more advanced features and is pretty basic, but works well on my Android tablet) and I have no problem streaming music from the Amazon servers. The issues I have would get one star for each one, but overall I'd have to stay with 3 stars.Issue #1 - no sd card support. I did download most of my prime music to my Android device, but had to take it off my and rely on the cloud because I couldn't move the prime music to my sd card and it was filling up my internal device storage. So if no wifi available, can't play any prime music, but that's OK because I do have plenty of other music on the sd card of my tablet.Issue #2 - not all albums appear to contain the original recordings.This is a bit odd and completely unexpected - it seems that at least some of the albums are NOT the original recordings of the album. Some of them I actually had the original record or cassette years ago which I played incessantly. Of course, these are long gone and it was good to find them on prime music...BUT I absolutely know what is on prime music is not exactly the original. It is the same songs, but they have been redone in a different style...almost like they were cuts that didn't make the original final album. I have found 2 instances of albums like this and I'm sure there are many more. Disappointing."

When I tried to update my Amazon mp3 player, it just vanished, and will not recognize this new app. Now I have lost the ability to play any of my Amazon music on my primary player. No lwhere did I see something saying the new app didn't work with gingerbread. Heads up Amazon, there are still a lot of gingerbread devices out there, especially smaller specialty devices."

Nice to be able to access it, but I've been lost rather often when searching for where on my device Amazon decided to download the song."

You can't download and save and it takes up WAY too much memory on a phone for just being a player.  It gets one star rather than zero since Prime members get it free.

1554,"Amazon",2015-07-07,1,"Eight (no, make that 15)  days in Amazon Music Store Hell.   My wife and I started having problems this past Sunday with Amazon Music Store, which she has been using for a month. On Monday, I replaced her old Moto X with a new Moto X, same gen, installed Music Store again, and started downloading all her music. Downloads were slow and practically overwhelmed my wifi with upstream requests. On Tuesday, all the downloaded (Offline) music files on her phone, about 700, were corrupted. On Wednesday, all the downloaded music files on my phone, about 300, were corrupted. On Thursday, tech support helped me figure out how to download the files again, because up to that point, Music store wouldn't let me download music files again. On Friday, my wife and I were driving 14 hours to Seattle. We verified that, even though we were playing only offline content, the app was still burning through my Verizon data plan. Her phone went through my entire monthly allotment in less than half a day. So I turned off data plan data. Amazon acknowledged the problem, said it's working on a fix, but has not yet offered any fixes. On Saturday, all the free content on both our phones was corrupted again, along with some of the paid content. For literally days worth of trouble, Amazon offered a $5 coupon. It's now Tuesday, eight days later, and this review won't change unless I hear from Amazon. If you're traveling somewhere and want to take your music with you, DON'T depend on this app.It's now Thursday, 10 days later, and the latest attempt to download music resulted in nothing but corrupted files. Interestingly enough, all the files I paid for are good this time, but all the prime free content is corrupted.So far so good. A new update installed, as of July 10, and we've gone two days without losing prime music. And just in case I didn't make this clear, the last two times the downloads were corrupted, only Prime music was affected, not the purchased music.I take it back. All the ""free"" music that I downloaded from Amazon for my wife is corrupted again. Am I paranoid to suspect that Amazon doesn't want its Prime members downloading and listening to free music. Why is it that only the Prime music downloads get corrupted, while the albums I bought remain playable. What is the point of offering free music if you then take it away after two or three days?"
1560,"Amazon",2015-03-15,4,"OK player, quality So So.   Predictions here for music that I like were not very on the mark, as far as the playlists went.quality could have been better , definitely has some competition out there .

1562,"Amazon",2017-05-03,1,"Complete waste of megabytes   Downloaded the app to listen to music under my Amazon Prime account and it will not play anything. Search an artist and try to play a song and all it does is prompt me to pay $9.99 a month. Click on one of the offered stations. And I get promptes to pay $9.99 a month. The phone is an S7. So I deleted it and went back to the competition. Also considering if this Amazon Prime is even worth it when it does not live up to all it claims to be. I would give a zero star rating if possible"

1623,"Amazon",2014-11-26,1,"As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon   As much as I love lots of things offered by Amazon, its Prime Music's desktop version sucks.  So much inferior to other widely-known streaming platforms.  The design of its Android app is also stupid, in that I'm required to switch my phone's default language from Chinese to English to be able to use it."
1633,"Amazon",2017-09-01,5,"Rockin & Rollin   They had music that I love & it was easy for this old lady to download."

1636,"Amazon",2016-05-25,5,"Amazon Music App   Amazon music is better then other app out there. The fact that no commercials or interruptions on stations is great. Lots of options when choosing playlist, and music of choice."

1639,"Amazon",2015-11-21,5,"Better than Rhapsody   This app is way better than most of the competitors out there.  I also have rhapsody and it is horrible unless your somewhere that has a strong wifi signal.  This app actually works sometimes with just the mobile network."
1640,"Amazon",2015-06-10,5,"So much music!   Have found new music, as well as most of my old favorites.The play lists are great too.So Much music, so little time! I bet if I turned my selections on and just let them play it would take days to finish. Just love that!Thank youCheers"

1658,"Amazon",2015-06-27,5,"Five Stars   ok"
1661,"Amazon",2015-10-07,5,"worth it!   Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!"
1662,"Amazon",2011-11-12,3,"Could be killer   Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store.Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well."
1667,"Amazon",2014-06-15,1,"prime music for all except people with all kindle fires   how crazy is that?I bet Kindle Fire owners version 1 will never get  new version.A  pioneer with arrows in his back!!!!I have 3 version 1 kindles. Loyal customer???"
1669,"Amazon",2014-04-19,5,"Love this app   I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay $150 a year for the service.  I didn't remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money.I am SO happy with this app.  Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I don't have to pay a ridiculous amount (or anything at all) to use this service."

Amazon is currently refunding  $12.96 but I decided to keep CD because I like it and found another case for it. Please keep the $12.96! I could not find a way to ""cancel"" my ""cancel"". Thank you!"
1678,"Amazon",2014-06-20,3,"Close, but no cigar.   Not quite as good as I expected. I expected more, if not all ""free"" music. I would think my $99 per year would allow me to also download free music. There are many music players out there with free streaming, and some (Tunee) with free downloads."
1686,"Amazon",2016-04-05,3,"Three Stars   Nice"
1695,"Amazon",2015-05-01,3,"Not for my phone.   I'm sure it would work wonderfully if I had unlimited data or maybe if I was using an amazon device.  But for my galaxy, I find that it consumes too much memory and streams away my data.  I uninstalled for this reason."
1703,"Amazon",2015-04-07,5,"Changed the way I listen to music!   This app has really changed the way I listen to music. So many choices and so little time! For the first few days I spent more time looking through all the music that was available than I did listening to the music. Definitely one of the things that makes Amazon Prime a good deal."
1704,"Amazon",2015-04-11,5,"Love amazon music   I love streaming music with amazon. Getting whole albums at a time is so much easier than trying to figure things out song by song. There is such a wide selection of prime music that is free for the listening. I am glad that I finally decided to give it a try. Love it!"

You can't figure out how to download a new version, it just takes you to this stupid page where you can add it to your cart!!  Just put a damn manual upload button on the page for God's sake!!!  whoever designed this app should be fired immediately!!!!!

1769,"Amazon",2015-02-24,1,"Constantly broke   I was really excited about getting more music through Amazon because i have prime. But all I'm getting is a bunch of disappointment. This useless app sends me a crash notice about every 2 hours and constantly froze when i did try and use it. Looks like ill keep using apple."
1772,"Amazon",2014-12-11,3,"Too little music available   Not nearly enough songs available as Rhapsody and you can only download to your computer if you purchase them, also unlike Rhapsody. Many songs you purchase do not include an accurate description. I won't be renewing my subscription at the end of my year. I will be going back to Rhapsody."
1773,"Amazon",2016-12-07,1,"Just terrible...   Never coordinated correctly with iTunes and Alexa.  Alexa rarely would play songs I KNOW I added to my personal library."
1774,"Amazon",2014-12-16,1,"Leaves me scratching my head   If you have 8 gb total on the internal storage and 32 gb of external storage (sd), you want to put large files, like music, on the external card. When I ran out of internal storage I checked the apps using the most storage: Amazon music, Amazon Kindle and the Amazon app were the top 3 and none have the option to move storage to the external sd, that I found. I uninstalled all three and all is good. It's a shame, but Amazon sure seems out of touch with what customers want and need for large file storage."

1799,"Amazon",2013-05-29,2,"Was good once...now this app is TERRIBLE!   This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."

1817,"Amazon",2014-01-22,2,"A store first - player as an afterthought   This used to be my main MP3 player on Android.  It was never great, but it worked.  Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player.  The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player.  You can't bypass this anymore.  There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet.  Uninstalled."

1895,"Amazon",2017-01-24,3,"Spotify is the best music app by far.   Amazon music doesn't have a large variety of music. The app freezes a lot and the Jazz selection is very thin."

I have had several services over the years and Amazon is by far the best. It's intuitive,  and plentiful. And it's a free benefit for having a prime membership.

1959,"Amazon",2014-12-16,5,"Better than itunes!   I honestly don't know why anyone would go with itunes when this is available. I love this service. I use it instead of Pandora or itunes. It has a history of every single CD I have ever purchased in the history of buying from Amazon. It was automatically downloaded for free."
1964,"Amazon",2016-12-11,4,"Good idea but lacks instructions and can be frustrating   Like the concept but Amazon Music does not explain how to use it ---- frustrating as its by chance you learn"

1970,"Amazon",2016-03-28,1,"Will Not Uninstall   In addition to other bugs, I cannot remove this and now it keeps trying to update, but that fails. Amazon chose poorly when the hired the developers for this. Shameful."
1976,"Amazon",2015-04-09,4,"Good, not yet great.   Make an option to exit the app. Put more selection into the Prime eligible music, there has to be a better way to search for music without having NOW and KIDZBOP being every other item on the list. Add more filters to make searching for music easier."
1978,"Amazon",2015-10-12,5,"Good one!   Workd great. If I look my kindle battery or don't want to carry it along with the other 325 pounds of stuff in my purse.  Have a back-up, plus can play what I want to listen to while I'm driving.  Thank you!"

1989,"Amazon",2014-12-12,4,"Great but   works great would like to figure out how to store music offline"
1990,"Amazon",2017-05-31,3,"Meh... it's okay. Maybe I'm hoping for too much.   It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."
1992,"Amazon",2016-02-16,4,"Very good if you have prime   It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting."
1995,"Amazon",2016-12-07,4,"Four Stars   Music selections are always changing, so your selections may not be there when you go back later to listen!"

2025,"Amazon",2015-07-14,5,"I love, love   I love, love, love, love, love Amazon Prime and the mobile app! I started the free trial thinking I would just give it a shot and wound up telling Amazon to definitely just charge me and continue the membership within hours! I cancelled other services that provided similat things and went from spending about $30 per month to just th $100 a year. The mobile music app is the best one I've ever had. Just this alone is worth the money. It is ridiculously user friendly. I actually crashed my phone within a couple of days because I couldn't stop myself and overfilled my memory. No worries though, dumped the entire song collection and what do you know? The entire thing was still in my cloud library. Didn't have to do a single thing but open up her back up and watch all the musical geniuses roll in. I give this app 10 stars out of 5. Way more than I expected for the money."

I'm pretty sure it isn't some specific notification that stops the player, it's just random. Then you have to turn on your phone, unlock, and hit play manually to restart. Big problem, but otherwise great app."
2187,"Amazon",2014-12-17,5,"Nice!   Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC.  I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.[On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]"

2192,"Amazon",2015-03-29,2,"A lot of hard work and it may function   This is one of the best examples of why software should work flawlessly, but the team behind amazon music makes sure it doesn't. It takes up enough memory to run a small virtual machine, the download queue often hangs with more than two albums in it, and today I had to uninstall the app and lose all the music I downloaded because two albums were stuck in limbo downloading. They were stored on my device fine, but the app day restarting every 5 minutes to download these two albums. I've always installed from the play store, let's see if you put a different version on your app store. I finally got a premium PHONE,  LG G3,  that just might run amazon prime music, but it's just that deplorable of programming. Please revamp the app, compared to the rest of Amazon this is atrocious."
2196,"Amazon",2014-12-06,1,"Interesting concepts, but fatally flawed.   I just wish the damned thing would work consistently.

2224,"Amazon",2014-09-13,2,"Could be much better. I expect more of Amazon. UI anyone?   The only thing I like about this app is it makes my music available. Given the large amount of music on my computer it would be almost impossible to have it all on my phone otherwise. They did just recently add a scroll where I can look for songs by their name and actually tell what letter I am near, before it was just a guessing game. The app really works best on WiFi and is spotty otherwise. It does not give me the option to listen to music based upon the genres So I am normally listening to all my music at once and skipping a lot of songs. If I search for an artist it does not let me play all songs with them in it. Additionally if I search for a song I have to play that song continuously or go back to the app and scroll laboriously through my song list. This is why I only use this app if I will be in the car an hour or more. It takes too much time to work it otherwise. So I still am stuck with a limited selection of music that can fit on my phone."

When I opened another music player, suddenly I couldn't see the song and artist in Amazon on my unlock screen anymore. Songs that I had downloaded to my library and  listened to before would now go into endless buffer sessions.

I never thought I'd ever need to give such a negative review to anything Amazon sells much less one of their products but this latest ""upgrade"" of Amazon Music has been a major disappointment to this user/ customer. My major complaint is the inability to upload songs from my laptop to Amazon Music. I've tried numerous times and all I get is the screen with the new logo on it and nothing else. The screen just stares back at me mockingly smirking."

Didn't like that amount of memory usage. The phone seemed to slow down and the app itself locked up more than I liked. Also noticed it wanted access to a lot of areas on the phone it didn't need to access. Didn't like that at all as it's giving away my data usage and increasing my costs for data uploading data I don't want to give away. Then found out I couldn't delete it or uninstall it. That made me determined to remove it. Which I did by wiping the phone and reloading it. Amazon you want to much information, photos, media info etc. You are increasing my data rates with needless uploads I don't need to give you and you don't need. All that just to hear music no thanks there are better ways out there.On top of that the app isn't very intuitive to use. I won't be reloading it, and would suggest avoiding it, as it's a memory hog and bloats your data rate needlessly."

2898,"Amazon",2011-09-29,5,"best music store   I love this store ever since I left Itunes a couple of years ago because Itunes had only protected songs and could not use it on my other MP3 devices.  Thanks to Amazon MP3 I have never gone back and all there songs are high quality and also has a large library of songs.  This app easily allows you to buy and download songs very quickly and any other songs you have stored on the Amazon Cloud is also accessible thru this app."
2899,"Amazon",2013-12-03,5,"Jamming Your Way!   This is the best way to play your favorite tunes with or without WiFi. You buy your music (the prices are very reasonable- to cheap) you download IF you want it on your device for anytime, anyplace listening. Or you can leave your tunes safe in the cloud so it does not take up any storage, you start the wireless and listen that way. Either way, the selection is nearly infinite. All the old classics to the newest hits....And best of all; NO Commercials!  And you don't have to listen to anything except what you want to hear. For listening on your phone or tablet, this is the real deal. No hidden fees. No upgrades. Just straight out jamming Your Way!"

3035,"Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"OK but could be better.   I haven't used this service much so my impressions are just prreliminary.  The interface is not intutive and there doesn't seem to be much help.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I was unable to locate music that should have been obvious.  The Beatles, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, etc.  The music that seem to come up in the playlists is all new (2000 to now) stuff that I've never heard of.  Not that I stay on top of modern music much (I'm 61).  I might fool around with it some more to make sure I'm not doing something wrong but if I can't get the music I'm interested in I don't see the point.  I already have Pandora and all my music library on my phone.  I appreicate it that Amazon gave us Prime members something for free but for me the jury is still out on how much a benefit it will be."
3036,"Amazon",2015-03-11,2,"lacking   Without Chromecast support this is just another portion of amazon prime that locks you into buying Kindles and Fire TV. It's a lack of flexibility like this that has kept me away from Apple lately."
3037,"Amazon",2016-03-04,5,"love it. use it everyday   love it. use it everyday. love that I can upload my own music, mix it with Prime music, and make playlists from both."

3050,"Amazon",2017-07-30,1,"One Star   Cost to much for music"
3052,"Amazon",2015-10-26,5,"Awesome!   So far I love it! I'm using it to assist my running routine. I love how I can download music to my device so I don't have to use my data! Love it!"
3056,"Amazon",2016-04-30,1,"Used to be awesome, now it's useless   It worked for a long time but now it won't even open. I've reported the problem several times and nothing has changed."
3059,"Amazon",2016-08-15,5,"Five Stars   It's crazy you can actually choose the musix even do offline mode to save data."
3060,"Amazon",2014-07-06,1,"I'd give no stars if I could   It just doesn't work. I haven't been able to get any song, playlist or album to play at all. I have a trouble ticket in with Amazon and the app keeps updating, but it still doesn't work. I hope they can get it resolved, because it's a great idea."
3064,"Amazon",2014-02-20,1,"non-compatible device?   I used to have this app on my kindle fire hd and loved it.

Only have it one star because it won't let me download it!"

3079,"Amazon",2015-12-07,4,"Prime bonus for sure   Great sound quality but limited choice. Definitely love offline mode with prime...great for travel. Great extra prime benefit for sure."
3081,"Amazon",2014-07-15,4,"Optimal Prime   how can we not love yet another free bonus from Amazon Prime? Sure there is some limitation to what music is available free, but then again, what IS available is FREE!  Loved the Prime shipping discounts already- this is the icing on the cake."
3083,"Amazon",2016-10-18,3,"Three Stars   Updated and changed the color of the icon. Why do they do that?"

3100,"Amazon",2016-03-27,3,"Its included with prime but need improvement.   Need newer music like Google, a better playlist feature, but I can't complain to much it's included in prime."
3103,"Amazon",2014-06-19,1,"BAH! Amazon Music with Prime   I loved the Amazon mp3 Player! Bit with each update it lost some of its appeal. Now it's totally lost it. And because I unknowingly installed the latest update, I now have Amazon Music. My main complaint is that it only works in portrait. I have a Sony Tablet S. For my tablet I have both a charging stand and a different stand that I use at work - both landscape. I have to keep turning it to portrait to see the lists and controls and menus. Am I mistaken that tablets are poplar now? This set up for a phone. Plus I keep getting code number errors and have to restart my tablet. I've emailed Amazon 3 times and had to reinstall  yesterday. What a pain. I definitely don't want Prime Music and it is always on there asking if I do or if I want to  purchase with that or regular. It switches menus when I try to listen to more than one song on an album, taking time for the switch that I could have been listening to the sample tracks. Plus, I do not want people on Facebook knowing what I'm listening to. Who cares? And that's an invasion of my privacy. Can you tell that I don't like this and I'm very unhappy with it? I'm starting to like Walkman and Songza more and more."

3128,"Amazon",2014-06-15,5,"Very nice application for managing Amazon Prime Music   This application is fantastic.  Not only does it ease the navigation of Prime music, it has a clean interface, and music plays from your library as if it were stored locally (broadband connection dependent, of course).Well done Amazon!"

3155,"Amazon",2014-01-14,4,"music music   Huge selection. It is very easy to find anything you are looking for. Selecting by song, album, genre, etc. Never takes more than a few short seconds to find everything you are looking for. Most prices are lower than other places I've looked. Highly recommend you search here."
3156,"Amazon",2013-01-15,2,"Still trying to figure out how to use it   The MP3 app is new to me and doesn't come with easy to use or understand instructions.  I am looking for a replacement for Rhapsody where I can purchase my music and store in the Cloud and pay from anywhere.  This app appears to fulfill those requirement; but the lack of simple instructions on how to use it is the reason for the low rating."

This used to be my favorite Amazon app. I was very excited when the prime music became available, even though the music selection was very limited. However, in the past month or so I've hardly between able to use the app because it keeps crashing. I get error messages constantly, I can't download items or delete items with the app freezing and its even screwing up the album cover thumbnail with the artist (putting a Beatles album cover with a Rolling Stones album for example). Often it takes a bunch of random songs and throws them together in an ""unknown  artist"" album. What? I hope Amazon fixes these issues soon, otherwise  I'll be deleting the app and finding one that actually works."

4807,"Amazon",2012-09-25,1,"So is anyone besides me upset? nay - mad?   So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say ""Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!"" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - ""City ID"" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)After a month I was all done.Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said ""It's free!"" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot ""download"" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The ""Artist"" column can not be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: ""display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues"" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a ""you must agree to this"" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!Yes. I am just that mad."

4928,"Amazon",2014-11-05,5,"Easy to use and tapped my collection I had downloaded  from Amazon before on other Android devices.   The free prime was not the best part; the best part was that my entire Amazon collection I had already paid for could be tapped. It is a very easy app to use, too."

4949,"Amazon",2012-04-24,3,"I love this player - especially in the car   It's great to have this player to access the music in your cloud. I use it a lot on long road trips. One huge complaint, however, is when I download music to my phone's SD card or create a playlist on my phone (as opposed to in my cloud). My music and playlists keep disappearing from my memory card!!! Very frustrating."
4951,"Amazon",2017-04-05,1,"Can't even get it installed   I have triple checked the compatibility but it errors out when I try to install. I had to write this review on a PC as it won't even allow me to review the app on my device until I have successfully installed it.

4976,"Amazon",2014-10-14,2,"not what I was hoping for.   I was hoping that this Prime service would replace a lot of other services I was using through the Google Play market. At the time of this review, I am currently using a Prime membership trial. I was hoping that Prime membership could help me alleviate some other services by using it. For instance, I love Netflix but prime instant video seems to have everything I need. The free shipping options with Prime in the market also make it a good purchase decision. I use google play music now and for one flat rate I can listen to as many songs or albums from as many artists as I want without having to download or buy individual songs or albums and I can play and stream them directly from the Play service cloud. I can make as many playlists as I want too. When I checked through this Amazon music app, most of the music I wanted to listen to has to be purchased individually and most of the albums have to be done the same as well. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on music. I will just stick with Google play music on this one. I believe they have it right. Still thinking of keeping Prime though. Just the shipping, Instant Video, and free book collection makes Prime worth it."

I was skeptical at first, but after a phone call to customer support they helped answer my questions.#1 I thought I made a mistake when I downloaded my first 10 albums to my phone thinking I had spent 150 accidentally on music... This is what I learned.Prime is nice because any prime song can be put on the cloud or saved to your device for free. I was after an option that would not take up all my phones memory, but still allow me to have music on the go with or without Internet access.The songs with price tags are not free. The songs with the prime symbol are. So not every song you desire will be free but a good majority of my selection was. I have 178 songs so far and only spent about 5 dollars purchasing some songs that weren't prime approved.In response to my #1 experience I ended up paying .99 for the one song that was not prime out of the albums."

7353,"Amazon",2016-11-08,2,"Wanted to love this, I really did   Wanted to love this, I really did. I love all things Amazon and the music selection and service with prime are good so I was excited to try the music unlimited. Unfortunately, the app itself skips constantly. I literally can't get through one single song without a skip. These are downloaded songs on TWO different phones, a Galaxy S3 and S5 so it's a streaming/connection issue either. App updates, cache clearing and restarts have not fixed it. It happens on both phones so it must be a problem with the app itself since it's the only faulty media experience on either. It makes the listening experience unbearable so I will be cancelling the free trial and looking elsewhere. It's a real shame they can't make this product work correctly."

Did you not test this before dumping this on us??  I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just don't have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software."

10405,"Amazon",2013-02-13,1,"HATE this app   HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon."

10472,"Amazon",2016-06-09,5,"Impressed!   Prime music impressed a friend and myself while listening to one of the playlists. We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists."

After screwing around with my Kindle for  hours I spent another hour on the phone talking a total of four people from Amazon before I was finally told "" your device is not compatible with this update and you need to buy a new Kindle"".  WTF!!!!  I am very disappointed with Amazon and the deliberate omission of this piece of very important information.  If you are monitoring this Amazon, you dropped the ball and I will buy an Apple Ipad before I spend another dollar on any of your devices."

10908,"Amazon",2011-05-01,5,"the cloud, the cloud   it's all about the cloud, it's the best thing, well not to mention actually buying CDs from Amazon is cheap and non drm locked"
10910,"Amazon",2011-07-22,2,"The most usefl app ever... hahahahah that was funny...   I hardly ever use it. Most of my music won't show up on it. Its problaby because of how it was ripped. Needs more codec support I guess (???)."
10916,"Amazon",2011-10-04,1,"No longer great   Shame on amazon.  This app no longer shows the daily free mp3 on the main screen, nor can you search for it through the app!!!!  :-("
10918,"Amazon",2012-07-03,4,"great   The only thing I think it needs is a complete my album option to get five stars. Otherwise, great app."
10920,"Amazon",2012-09-09,5,"Mp3   I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems."
10934,"Amazon",2011-10-11,2,"Wth   What happend to the free song of the day ): Bring back and i'll add two stars. Everything else works well."
10938,"Amazon",2011-04-26,4,"Keeps getting better   The last update makes this app an all in one player. Please add additional widgets, 4x2 would be perfect. Keep it up."
10949,"Amazon",2014-10-15,4,"Mostly great   It's almost fabulous. I don't have an iPhone so I can't get my iTunes unless I'm at home. This app allow me to listen to my Amazon library while I'm out and about. My one star less is because there's no way (that I've found) to set music to a timer. I like to fall asleep to subliminal and binaural beat tracks sometimes, but I'll wake up hours later and have to turn it off because it just keeps playing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying my tunes :-)"
10952,"Amazon",2016-05-16,4,"Love amazon music!   Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far,  is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
10958,"Amazon",2015-10-21,3,"average.   offline has many Glitches. offline should not require Loading that's the whole point of Offline so I find it reacting like its buffering. needs offline quality setting added"
10960,"Amazon",2014-10-21,3,"Money Talks, Eh?   I think it's great although I would like to be able to download music to my PC or iMac rather than just my mobile telephone.  Since it's bundled with Prime Instant Video, I'm not getting my money's worth and should only have to pay a portion of the $99.00 that I'm being charged.  When I want to buy something, I'm told that I have to use a local credit card which charges me an exchange fee (I live abroad).  However, when I signed up, Amazon gladly accepted my U.S. credit card.  Don't you think that's a bit hypocritical?"
10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App   I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10962,"Amazon",2014-10-31,4,"Great extra with the prime membership   Great extra with the prime membership.  I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have.  I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music.  It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly.  I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
10964,"Amazon",2017-10-21,5,"I like the cost versus some other guys   I like the cost versus some other guys.  There are some tracks that I cannot find though.  But the price makes it all better."
10965,"Amazon",2017-06-23,5,"Great tunes   Works great and I love that the songs I purchased are on there. Plus all the other channels that are available. I just wish phone company's didn't hammer us with usage charges"
10966,"Amazon",2014-06-16,2,"Can't use it   I suppose it may be OK, but since I am an ""Invited Guest"" of a Prime member (my wife), I can't use it on my smartphone or Kindle Fire (my wife has neither so there's zero chance of having more than one device using it at a time).  I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is.  Tough luck, I guess.  I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora."
10979,"Amazon",2014-06-23,1,"Doesn't work   I got all excited for nothing when they announced prime music streaming... the songs won't download to my device! And there is no way to determine where to download it to (device vs sd card). How annoying! Not sure why Amazon would announce something that doesn't work and doesn't seem to have a help section to tell you how to make it work?! You're better than this Amazon, I paid almost $100 for my Prime membership so I believe in you Amazon!!!"
10980,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"Amazon Prime Music   I'm excited to see where Amazon will go with this new feature. It's early so naturally there will be some quirks. Initially I found it a bit difficult to navigate and find music in my library. I'm curious if I cancel my subscription to Prime if I no longer have access to the music I loaded onto my device. For now I'll go with 3 stars but hope as the program develops it will improve. It's Amazon, I'm sure it will be a great product in no time."
10981,"Amazon",2013-02-23,4,"Cloud Player was mind changer for me.   Amazon MP3 was preinstalled on my Android device, and I initially uninstalled it because I don't like ""Bloatware"". However, I got an email from Amazon that said my former CD purchases were available through the Cloud Player and that made me change my decision to reinstall the app. I enjoy the fact that most CD's are automatically 'ripped' to the Cloud once purchased, making my music available anywhere. Great product for FREE."
10984,"Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Nice, but room to improve   Nice idea but still room for improvement. Android app user interface isn't as intuitive as it should be, and capabilities in general seem limited. For instance, the ability to shuffle across a collection of albums or a user-defined playlist doesn't exist or has eluded my search so far.That said, the audio quality seems fine and it's a nice added benefit that halps make up for increasing the cost of a Prime membership."
10991,"Amazon",2014-10-21,4,"... downloadable trough prime subscription not just some but I like the selection available   Wish all music was downloadable trough prime subscription not just some but I like the selection available"
10998,"Amazon",2017-02-09,5,"Love this app   I get all the music I want, right to my phone. I love this."
10999,"Amazon",2014-10-22,4,"Four Stars   Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members."
11000,"Amazon",2017-03-23,1,"If you don't want to pay, you're only allowed to look   So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app? Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to ""free music"" with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
11001,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"It's music to my ears   One of the unexpected benefits of Amazon prime is the music service that comes with it. Download the Amazon music app and your all set to enjoy thousands of music files. You can stream them our download them to your phone. They are available as full albums, individual songs, or listen to preselected playlists. Get Amazon prime so you can appreciate everything you get with it."
11003,"Amazon",2013-01-20,4,"Good   This is good app to store most, not all my music (only because I haven't paid the $25 annual fee). Great playback. It would have gotten 5 stars but it has an tendency to give playback errors or sometimes have connection issues on all sources (PC, tablet or cell). If that gets fixed would give 5 stars for sure!"
11006,"Amazon",2014-10-09,5,"Amazon Rocks.   Just want to say Thank You Amazon.Since I love music so much, you made it so easy to listen to them.I love the many choices I have to listen to, not limited to just certain ones.So easy to find and navigate and explore.I even told my family and friends to join up. They sure wont be disappointed at all.Keep up the Good Work.Love Ya Guys."

11018,"Amazon",2014-10-09,4,"Worthwhile for Prime Members at Least   As an Android user and an Amazon Prime member, I got this app to take advantage of the Prime Music Amazon now offers for free for their Prime subscribers.  It is functional and the music selection has improved vastly since it started up this summer.  If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and have an Android device you might as well take advantage of this."
11020,"Amazon",2016-10-24,1,"Get google music instead   clunky and not as good as Google Music"
11024,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Better than Itunes   I completely changed from Itunes due to their many restrictions. I am a very firm believer in if you buy music it should be yours, not with a copyright restrictions and also only to be coded to be played by certain devices. So Amazon music is the only place I now purchase from, and it is saved in my account for me to access at all times anywhere."
11027,"Amazon",2015-03-19,5,"... had this app since it came out and I love it. However   I've had this app since it came out and I love it. However, last night I downloaded Android 5.1 to my phone, now Amazon music player crashes whenever I hit play on any Prime Music. Please fix!! My morning commute is not the same!!UPDATE 3/23/15: got the 5.1 fix installed, happy days are here again! Changing to 5 stars, thanks Amazon!"
11029,"Amazon",2014-06-17,5,"Yay!   Finally!  This is great so far, I used the Amazon MP3 for all my music, so the transition wasn't bad for me.  My only criticism is that their catalog for streaming is not that big, but I understand that this is because the service is brand new.  I am sure as time goes the catalog of songs available is going to increase.  Thank you Amazon!"

11035,"Amazon",2013-06-05,3,"Is constantly ""looking"" for the cloud   The fact that Amazon has offered this app for free is great but when installed on a smart phone instead of wanting to play songs downloaded to the hard drive on the phone it always wants to go on the net to play from the cloud. This became so annoying to me that I now use an entirely differant music player on my phone."
11037,"Amazon",2014-10-23,1,"No longer works on the OnePlus One!!!   This app used to work fine on my OnePlus One, but now it crashes all the time.  Please fix ASAP so that I can enjoy it once again.I believe there might be a compatibility issue with the latest CM 38R update?"
11047,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"Ejoying The Benefits of Prime!!!!   I so enjoyed rebuilding my library after loosing it to a system crash. What I liked most of all was the access to the many music playlists that are available and also the music that had been on my wish list for years were made available through Prime. Thank you. Yours Truly a future Prime Member."
11048,"Amazon",2013-02-10,5,"Easy access   I love the way I can go either on my phone, or my laptop and search for music etc. I already have an account with Amazon, so everything downloads  instantly, and without problems. If I should have a problem, it is usually very easy to fix."
11051,"Amazon",2011-04-27,1,"UPDATED Force Close when opening Settings menu or play   UPDATE After review of system event log it appears there is a conflict with an EQ library loaded by the Equalizer app. After stopping this app Amazon MP3 player works fine, no Force Close. After loading Amazon MP3 Player, the Equalizer app says the device does not support Reverb effect, so it looks like two conflicting libraries using the same API and if Amazon's loads first both programs can co-exist but with reduced functionality in Equalizer.Useless. Any attempt to open the settings menu or play music causes a Force Close. Test this code on Google flagship phones before you release it, ya big dorks.Nexus S"
11060,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Easy to use   Works exceptionally well.  i purchased a CD and the Cloud/Bitrate option to download Apocalyptica's ""Worlds Collide"" album.

11070,"Amazon",2013-03-02,1,"i did love it...   It was great on my droid, but won't stream on my LG. That's a big deal to me as I was using it all the time. Now if I want a song, I have to download it to my device in order to listen to it. Guess I need a new place to buy all my songs and that sucks."
11074,"Amazon",2011-03-31,1,"Doesnt play   On DroidX running 2.2, most of my music tracks dont player, the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks...FOREVER. this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement. Those are my thoughts."
11077,"Amazon",2014-06-17,3,"This was not what I order   I order a different plug that had a different connection. Because I was desperate to connect to a power source I use it. It worked so I settled. My complaint is with Amazon for sending the wrong item. The order numbers were similar but not the same."
11078,"Amazon",2015-01-21,5,"Especially love her Christmas album   I discovered Enya with this. Especially love her Christmas album, beautiful sounds!

11080,"Amazon",2014-09-18,1,"Looks like we won't be keeping the Prime account after all   Unfortunately I have a windows phone so it doesn't work for me, and my husband has a Samsung Galaxy III that was made for the Canadian market so it won't load into his phone either!!! Looks like we won't be keeping the Prime account after all :("
11081,"Amazon",2013-02-10,3,"Does what it's supposed to do   Amazon still hasn't worked out its cloud server interface as well as they should, and they utterly ignore the needs of people like me who want it to handle podcasts (which iTunes does do)"
11082,"Amazon",2015-07-16,3,"sucker price   I was disappointed on the Super Wednesday prime day when they advertised a fish finder for a low price,  but when you opened it up it was more than 25 times the advertised price.Really gets your attention. .... but don't deliver."
11084,"Amazon",2011-05-09,1,"Update Destroyed Awesome App-  Moto Droid 2   I was using this app a LOT to listen to music but after updating recently, all it says is 'network error' or 'error playing song' on both 3G and WiFi connections. :'( I will change to 5 stars if it gets fixed"
11086,"Amazon",2011-08-16,5,"works   This is a pretty good application, I think that it could use a refresh here and there though.  -Otherwise, a good app"
11089,"Amazon",2011-05-18,3,"Just ok   My greatest beef with Amazon player is how limited the settings are on the player itself. I love crossfading between tracks. Get this feature and I'll make this my default player. Until then, not so much."
11090,"Amazon",2014-10-12,4,"I love to use this app   I love to use this app.  The downside for me is going to be whether or not I resubscribe to Prime when it comes due.  I am not sure I can justify $99 for this privilege.  It will be cheaper in the long run to simply buy the music."
11092,"Amazon",2015-05-02,1,"Nope Nope Nope   Because this seems to be a prerequisite to downloading music purchased from Amazon, I won't be purchasing music from A again. It's difficult to use. It's invasive. It requires the system's security settings to be lowered."
11093,"Amazon",2014-10-23,5,"Great addition to amazon prime   Really great collection of music and it's organization only thing that I'd change is adding a feature close to Pandoras music mix to give you a saved playlist of music close and varying from the original added song or artist."
11094,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"great idea but Amazon needs to work out a few bugs.   Love the included music.  Prime has even more value now.The App locks up on my mobile phone and the browser version has a few querks."

11096,"Amazon",2014-10-27,1,"NOT USEFUL AMAZON!   Even with ""Prime"" you still have to pay for songs or albums!  You only get snippets of the music for free, then are required to purchase the individual song or album to hear it in it's entirety. NOT USEFUL AMAZON!"

11118,"Amazon",2014-11-04,1,"horrendous   Read the other reviews and thought it can't be that bad. WRONG!! The app kept asking for credit card info and would not show me any music for sale without it. Uninstalled and shopping elsewhere."

11264,"Amazon",2014-06-17,4,"Store on sd card...   I've noticed a lot of negativity due to lack of sd storage. Yes, you can't natively download to an sd card, however your phone should have a file manager where you can export to an sd card. If you've ever used a pc or mac this should be a simple concept. It's just like moving files from one folder to another. Your music player apps will read mp3 files from anywhere on your phone. It would be nice to have the option in the settings in order to eliminate a step, but sometimes we need to do things on our own and use a little thinking to get there."

At this point I couldn't be more disappointed as I am right now. Wait! Yes I can be more disappointed. Yes I am! After being talked into getting a new kindle bc they claimed my warranty was up and I disagreed with them but I was losing a no win situation. So I decide it invest once again, in another kindle. Seeing that the hdx is no lonher available (or so I was told), I decided to try the HD 10, thinking it was gonna be better that the HDX. I couldn't be more wrong. The one thing I looked forward to was getting back into my music. Come to find out that the HD 10 doesn't allow you to purchase music to add to your collection. So now I'm forced to purchase music from my phone and sync it to my kindle. That's if I decide to keep.it. It already has one strike against..wait no, two strikes against them.Just found out that I can't even download the Amazon Music app into said Kindle, it said it was 'unavailable'...'Una..who? This gets better and better. A total waste. I feel for everyone who's experiencing this too. Both investments the kindle and the actual music is about to go 'Bye Bye'. I just know it! And I'm not a happy can per right about now, not that amazon really cares. As long as they get the money, it's all.good...."
11707,"Amazon",2015-05-05,1,"READ ZERO STARS   I had to DELETE this App, because my Norton App Adviser informed me that Amazon was accessing my SIM card info.  I looked at the permissions,  but Amazon says nothing about this.  Ultimately,  I trust Norton over Amazon.  There is no GOOD reason for Amazon.com to access all of our SIM cards.  I did make a complaint to the developers for what it's worth.  This makes me reconsider renewing PRIME when it comes time.  I sadly, spent alot of time and energy adding to my Amazon Music collection and now I cannot use it."

The setting does not give you the option to disable that check or even change the time interval.  Hate apps that don't let you control if/when they run and drain your battery."
11712,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Getting better with age   I've been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it.  One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating.  The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists  that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library.  Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers.  It is truly a great value added service."
11716,"Amazon",2016-05-20,1,"Could use some editing   I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service  providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it."
11718,"Amazon",2017-09-13,1,"Now trash app like others before it.   As of the latest 7.1.2 version this stand alone app records audio without permission and no way to turn it off.  I have no use at all for this ""feature"".  This is not an Alexa, tap, or even a Kindle app, this is on the Android version used on phones. No choice for consumers means no value to consumer. Time to move on and find a better player that let's me choose how I consume my media. Last two updates have had spotty connection. This was last nail in the coffin."
11722,"Amazon",2016-06-08,3,"Deletes playlists   I've been a member of Prime for a really long time. And a user of the Music app since it first appeared. And maybe the problem is specific to the Fire HD 10? It seems to work fine on my desktop - but I'm not going to risk testing it either since I'm talking about thousands of songs which are only manageable with playlists.After a few weeks of listening to my music offline, which is a mix of purchased prime and my own collections of CD songs, the player starts skipping over certain/ random purchased Prime songs. Of course they are the ones I listen to the most. Flashbacks of digital rights usage? Clearing the cache does nothing, syncing does nothing. Support had me delete the data which fixes the playback but it also deletes the playlists. Playlists that constitutes hours if not days of music - gone - poof!  The option to download the cloud playlist does not work past 1 to 3 songs. Transferring a large music library from my computer is best done directly on the SD card with a card reader as the USB cable option hangs up pretty quickly. Transfer of purchased music results in duplicates on the device. Oh sure, I remember which one is which since the last century.  The Amazon Music player must keep the playlists internal to itself rather than isolated and safe? It would make so much more sense to have those playlists synchronisable wouldn't it?Reminds me of when ms quit selling music, their player crapped out and amz stepped in."
11723,"Amazon",2015-03-05,1,"Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of ...   Either Amazon did not think to allow the transfer of downloaded prime music to an SD card, or it purposefully prevents such transfers. While the latter is more egregious, both are unforgivable.  A few lines of simple coding (if that) would solve the problem but so far there is no indication that Amazon is working to do that. Are you? Hint to Amazon: ""free"" prime music is not free. Your prime customers are paying a hefty annual fee for the privilege. Second hint: even if the music is transferred to an SD card, which admittedly could allow easier movement to another device, Amazon still could code it to prevent access if the user is not signed into a valid prime account, so what does it matter? For your (tens of) thousands of customers who have limited data plans and devices with minimal internal memory, this is a huge problem. We are not always connected to wifi and therefore cannot always access your ""cloud"" to listen to our prime music. Fix this glaring problem and this review goes to five stars, because the ease of downloading prime music and the sound quality are impressive. Thanks."
11729,"Amazon",2017-06-02,2,"Terrible Service   It has some good music but the selection sucks. The songs I want are there .

It give me a message with a code and tells me to contact customer service.  Why does the app not send this report itself?  Once the error starts it is hard to even clear as it just keeps retrying the function and errors out again.  Today I was just trying to edit a playlist.  I have to reboot the phone after I add or delete 3 or 4'songs as the errors start.  I don't want to call customer service.  Oddly now as I poke around it seems picking up the phone is my only option. Nowhere is the online chat support? Send a text or email?"

11740,"Amazon",2015-09-27,1,"Barely functional   This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo."
11742,"Amazon",2016-08-12,5,"Great music app!   Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site.

I love this company and everything about it."
11749,"Amazon",2014-07-05,1,"Amazon is stealing my music!   Disappointed is not even close.  Amazon prime is cherry picking songs from previously downloaded albums and refusing to let me access this purchased music unless I pay more money!"
11751,"Amazon",2016-02-24,1,"If this gets better, maybe it can rise to mediocre.   Mediocre at best.  The prime music stations are utterly lacking in descriptive information.  You are forced to try one-- and if it's absolutely horrible to you?  Too bad-- the stupid app thinks you *liked* it, even if you only listened to the first few seconds of each song, before clicking ""no"".. and after 3 or 5?  You realize that station is not for you.But.  The app *now* thinks you LIKE that sort of crap-- and offers more of the same dreck!  Horrible!A simple description under each station is too much to ask?  Or even just a category label?  No?  As if I'm supposed to recognize these people (after which the station is named... right)?I'd love to learn about new artists--  but not at the risk of opening a station that absolutely sets my teeth on edge (i.e. ""cow hard country""... makes me ill).Where is a FILTER for the prime stations?  I don't care what is popular!  I just wish to eliminate musical styles I find objectionable-- but there is no way to do this in this app.One star, all but useless."
11754,"Amazon",2014-11-16,1,"Wanted this to be good.   I wanted this app to be good since I'm a prime member.  I could get over the clunky gui, but the app won't play more then one song off a playlist or album. This used to work fine but as updates have come it's gotten worse and worse. First it would only play five or six songs off a playlist/album. Now after the most recent update it will only play one then stop. The app will also crash every time I try to play a downloaded song. Really buggy and poorly written program. I expect much better from Amazon."
11764,"Amazon",2014-06-27,1,"Wont Work on Older Hardware   Great job. Promote your new prime music and make the player incompatible with older hardware (2 year old phone and first generation Kindle).

Guess I will say screw it to Amazon Prime Music and stick with tried and true music players that don't give me a hassle.Be warned, if you don't like spending several hundred dollars every year to upgrade your tech then you wont like this application because it wont like your perfectly good hardware.

11775,"Amazon",2017-06-05,1,"After the love has gone.....gotta find another player.   I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car.  Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold.  The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.  And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it.  What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."
11778,"Amazon",2017-06-23,1,"Don't Upgrade   Nope, now they're forcing you into a pay to play.  With the app you can no longer just search for a song and BUY it.

11783,"Amazon",2017-08-23,2,"Amazon Prime Music - I use it because it's free and without commercials otherwise I wouldn't bother.   I get the ""Prime"" version with my prime account for free otherwise I wouldn't use it.  The app itself is pretty looking but the functionality is average and the music service itself is below average.The real benefit of Amazon Prime Music is no commercials otherwise every other music app (Pandora, Slacker, etc.) is much better in every way.The available music is limited and music stations in Amazon Prime Music are horrible.  My guess is that it's because they want you to buy the unlimited music service or because they'd have to pay the artist and don't want to in a ""free"" service.  Example: The other apps have a ""top pop station"" where all the latest and greatest is played and the selection is excellent.  Amazon Prime Music - not even close.  Amazon claims these stations / play lists are created by experts.  I'd add say it differently....they're created by experts who are limited by the music available."
11784,"Amazon",2015-12-16,5,"Cool App   I've used several different streaming music apps.  Some tried forcing me to upgrade to get rid of ads and others won't force you but the ads are inserted in at ridiculous frequency! I downloaded this to try the no ads steaming with Prime.I like it!  It's really easy to use, I can create my playlist for work, working out, relaxing or whatever.  I also like that I can search for an artist and add songs that way for through channels.  Another cool thing is the xRay Lyrics that shows the song lyrics as the song is playing. Awesome!The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to add artist to an existing channel - similar to Pandora.  Other than that, I like this app,  I can pause, skip and shuffle.  It definitely helps my day pass faster when I can listen to music I like while I'm working."
11791,"Amazon",2016-03-19,5,"Best music app I've ever used   I don't understand how this app doesn't have all 5 star ratings.  There is nothing it could possibly do better.  I've stopped using Pandora altogether.  Absolutely a must download for any Prime member.UPDATE: After using this app for several months now, I am still in love with it.  The navigation is pretty simple and doesn't require re-thinking all the time.  Lyrics display if you want them to, which is a cool feature I've not seen anywhere else.  Album art, great selection, the same stuff doesn't play over and over again, it's just great.  Also, I haven't noticed an abundance of live albums which always bugged me on Pandora.  I don't want to listen to live recordings, I want the studio release!  If you love live music and hate studio stuff, I suppose that's an issue.I continue to add to my library constantly and this is just the #1 music app in my opinion.  I don't believe it has the ability to identify a song that is playing on the radio or anything like that, which is an improvement I would like to see.  I currently use Google's widget for song identifying, then add it to my amazon library."

I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :)**********************I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon.

Using Android app on Samsung S4TL:DR - App not recommended and will not use in its current state even when service is free.  Buggy, prescriptive and not user friendly. Pity as the service itself seems quite good.Pros :Simple install/setup - picks up amazon account by itself from your device if you already have another amazon appManaged playlists are nice, good varied selectionLots of good music in thereCons :Automatically scans your device and inserts any other music it finds into the app's music library - no way to disable this - no way to exclude or remove songs located elsewhere on your device (it simply adds them back in when it scans again) - no way to filter library so it only shows music you downloaded through Prime Music - it mixes it with anything it found during the device scanNo way to specify download location - defaults to using internal storage instead of external SD card, limiting downloads severely.Stutters fairly frequently during playback of downloaded tracks.No way to perform a multi-select of artists/albums/tracks within the library - have to perform actions on each one individually (adding to playlist/remove from library etc).more settings needed in the poorly populated 'Settings' screen such as : - specify download location - specify which folder(s) to scan for exiting music - disable device scan"

11821,"Amazon",2016-10-17,5,"Best Streaming Music App or Web based yet.   First, to clarify, I am not new to streaming audio and have them all from Pandora to Tidal. There are pros and cons to each and everyone's preferences are different. For me, I like to pick a Genre or Style and have the app do the rest (Pandora). On the other hand, I like to reminisce and find specific Artist (Pandora,Spotify,Tidal.)That being said, I don't like to have certain Genres shoved in my face everytime I open the app (You Know who you Are.) Then, there is Sound Quality and WiFi vs Cellular ( Tidal and Spotify) for SQ and (Pandora and Spotify) for Cellular.Then there is the Skip limit thing which drives me nuts, you have to have Teen age girls to understand this one.Anyway, the New Amazon Ultimate Music is by far the Best Streaming Audio on the market today, SQ, Stations, Playlist etc...P.S I have cancelled Tidal and Pandora, my kids still prefer Spotify but when the Amazon Family option becomes available ( Late 2016) I will cancel them as well.Hope this review is helpful, Thanks"
11824,"Amazon",2017-04-15,3,"where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the ...   It's all right to have on in the background, no different than Spotify, except for one thing. Some of the songs don't sound right. Has anyone else noticed this? Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others. Amazon seems to be too cheap to pay for the license to the actual album??? Kinda disappointed to be duped."
11829,"Amazon",2017-11-06,5,"Love amazon music.   This has worked great for us to date. We made a play list for our wedding with this app (I am a Prime member). It's nice being able to take our favorite music with us and being able to save it to an SD card when no internet is available. Only precaution-- you can not change the order of songs on your playlist once you have created it. The first song you save becomes the last one to play and the last one you save the first one that plays. I wish Amazon would add the ability to rearrange the order of the songs on any playlist you create / save"
11833,"Amazon",2015-02-28,1,"Why can't I organize my music like other music apps???   This does not meet my expectations.  I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not.  In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm looking for.  Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck.  It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close.  If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer.  If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck.  This app does not let you pull up by composer.  Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app.  I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title.  I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums.  Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to.  I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books.  Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background.  Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too.  However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books.  The code wouldn't be that difficult.  Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good.  My dogs are unemployed and they are pretty good coders.  They'd be willing."
11836,"Amazon",2017-09-26,5,"Yup   Checking it out. Old Redneck here, looking for more old Classic country.  Not DJ dribble and overplayed popular hits.  ... but ""CLASSIC"", by every definition, Belly rubbin', Belt buckle shinin' dancing with your Woman, cryin in yer beer tunes."

11860,"Amazon",2014-11-04,5,"I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies   I do notice that on small occasion amazon ""greys out"" a choice, however compared to what the have you certainly can spend a lot time selecting what you want.  I hope amazon does not raise their prices as so far, prime is worth the small increase.  I notice amazon has gotten better about the freight and prime movies.  Prime movies, however, has such a small offering I ususally just skip those as I don't want even accidentally trapped into further pricing.  We own our own movies, plus have Netflix and Grandma goes to the movies with the grandkids so we are cool with amazon on the movie part.  There has been times in the past you could log on to amazon and there was no movies in prime ...so we got used to it.  Last month we ordered three complete boxed sets of movies so that will keep us busy."
11861,"Amazon",2015-09-23,1,"Why the short sample times?   Amazon digital music downloads would do much better with increased time for listening to samples. In most instances, the listener never gets a good idea of the music because of the 30 seconds sample time. I often pass over songs that have a very limited sample of a song that I might otherwise buy. 30 seconds will give you an intro, or part of a verse, or perhaps part of a chorus or instrumental. I would rather know what I am buying when I am browsing for new music. At other sites they allow you to listen to the whole song! Also, allowing the user to choose the folder to download to would be nice."
11862,"Amazon",2017-04-17,5,"The only music all you need!!!   Amazon music is way better than Pandora or any other music listening app out there. I love it and  it's the only one I use now.  I've took all the others off my phone to free up storage."

I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.Amazon, get it together."
11872,"Amazon",2017-01-26,5,"Really Awesome!!!!   Love Amazon music! It's great for listening to purchased music, and with Amazon Prime there are tons and tons of great music to listen to for free (not really free because you pay for a prime membership) but it's a wonderful perk and if used enough you get your money worth!! You can download music to play offline without data or wifi (perfect for airplanes). Would recommend this!!!"
11875,"Amazon",2015-06-10,1,"Takes up all my internal memory.   Adding my voice here.  Currently using up 3.52 GB of my usable 4.94 GB.  Refuses to be relegated to SD card storage.  Read about some app that will let you move your purchased music to SD but won't move prime music.  I guess prime just has to be streamed if you want to use it.  Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone.  You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected.  You don't need to hog my internal memory.  I guess you are only for top end phone users.  I can't afford you.Listen from the cloud you say?  Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops.  I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what?  It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone.  Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds.  Amazon, I love you.  But I hate your music app."
11876,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"promising but...   I love Prime music, but the delivery system (download/streaming) could be greatly improved.  There seems to be way too many hiccups. Songs start and stop very frequently.  Play button is still activated, but shutting it off and starting it back on doesn't resolve the stoppage. So... you skip to the next song. This is really the last thing any of us want to do: micro-manage our streaming music player instead of listening to music and doing other things while we listen (novel concept). I think the song rotation is better than I-Tunes but the stability of the player... not so much. Three stars might be a bit optimistic."

I have XM radio and this service way out performs XM radio. I listen to Amazon Prime Music way more than XM now.  I can pick my own songs and play it from my library or chose from the Prime library.The only CON I can think of right now is Amazon Prime Music needs a COMEDY channel, that is the only reason I still have XM radio.The views stated in this review are based off of my own experience and testing/comparison of this product against other similar products.

11883,"Amazon",2016-11-04,2,"Prime Unlimited Good Value, iPhone App just So So, Echo integration Poor   I am going to give this overall a rating of 2 for now and will come back and update if Amazon fixes these issues.First I will say a few positives, the music selections are excellent vs. what they previously offered on Prime. I think $7.99 for Prime members for music unlimited is a very reasonable deal. Second I think the iPhone App is pretty good too. With each update it seems to get easier and easier to navigate.Now the Cons - easy things to fix:1. On the App, make the fonts bigger so a user can read what song, artist is playing without squinting. This should be a no brainer. With that said, most other music apps are just as poor in this area - not a good excuse though.2. The music recommendations for offline mode - I have 1GB of space on my phone allocated to offline recommendations. It barely uses it and tells me my device is almost full.  So I get one playlist as a recommendation and it won't try to add more. I have 2GB of space free on my device. I feel like I am missing out on a big part of what I am paying for, offline music.Now the Cons - harder to fix, or at least very inconsistent and if you search Amazon help forums, others are complaining as well:3. Integration with Echo - When I just had Prime Music and my own Cloud Library Echo worked great. Since the release of Unlimited which I accepted the free trial almost the first day, Echo is a wreck. It started off it seemed to only shuffle my Prime Unlimited music that I had added to my Library. I had a hard time getting Echo to my music I had uploaded. Then one day the exact opposite happened. It would only shuffle music I had uploaded. Even worse, it doesn't even shuffle on the command ""Echo Shuffle My Music"" or ""Shuffle Songs from my Cloud account"".  On this command, echo starts with the same songs until I say ""shuffle"" again and skip a song. Then it says ""enabling shuffle mode"" and it shuffles. But the next time I do it again it picks a new different song to always start with. Obviously the Echo/Cloud logic is broken and needs to be fixed. It is flat out stupid how it works right now and I trust Amazon is working on it. At the same time I have been considering loading my 10,000 MP3s to Amazon Cloud for the $25 per year. No way I will do that if shuffle is messed up.4. Related to #3, when I do use the shuffle command, it only plays songs I have uploaded. It does not shuffle in any songs that I have added through Prime Unlimited. I can play those songs or albums by explicitly asking for them, but they will not mix in with random shuffles. Again, a month ago this was opposite, I had a hard time getting my uploaded songs to play, only Prime songs will shuffle, now it is reversed.I am a big Amazon fan. The App issues I can mange. The Echo/Prime Music execution is poor at this time.  If this improves I will update my review."
11884,"Amazon",2016-07-07,1,"Inadequate music selection   I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection."

Allows offline listening on a number of devices (but as one would expect, no copying in sharable formats).  Free music selection is very broad and I enjoy hundreds of songs on PC, tablet, and android phone.  Good options for automatically downloading new library additions device by device.  Also allows you to store owned music that CAN be shared -"
11893,"Amazon",2017-03-02,4,"Great for Prime users   Great option for prime subscribers, you can set up a library of your long lost music. Also listen to complete CDs before you buy. I really suggest looking into the library option."

I actually really like this app as a Prime Member but the one GIANT mess up that I see is the need for data even to play music that is downloaded. I ask you... what is the point of me downloading the music at all if I still need Data to play it???? You guys fix this and I will update my rating. You will see in my screen shot I enabled Airplane mode to emulate data loss and show you what is happening. I experience this in a natural way constantly as I happen to live out in the country side and have plenty of areas of travel that have little to no data which makes the idea of downloading music popular to me."

And note, you have to be in playing mode in order for that icon to appear. Works good as such. I've been able to make purchases, access Cloud, and download to my device. Sweet."
11899,"Amazon",2016-12-19,2,"Latest updates hard to use   I hate typing bad reviews, but maybe Amazon may listen. I have been using the Amazon Music app on my computer for a few years, so I have experience with it. I am also a Web Developer, so I know how to use a computer. When the latest updates for this app arrived, I was immediately put off. If all you do is play music, it works fine. Uploads are not intuitive at all.In the older version, when you wanted to upload music, you added it by choosing a file/folder with a browser, or you dragged files/folders onto the app. Then, you saw the list of songs with an uploading icon next to the ones in queue, and the finished ones indicated as such. After uploading, you could clear the queue, so the next time you upload something, you could see exactly what was happening.Now, you drag files/folders onto the app, as before, but only the songs that are actively uploading or finished are displayed. Unless you counted, you have no idea how many are left to upload. They only get added as they upload. And the queue list shows everything you have ever uploaded, so if I want to see what is in progress, I have to find it in the list. I have thousands of songs. Unless I search for the songs that are uploading, I have no idea it is even working.This app would be much more useful for me if it would bring back the old upload method. Everything else is not bad."

Let me download all the music and you fix the problem.  You can still manage the digital rights and we don't have to wait for your crappy servers to decide to let me access my music.  Most disappointing amazon experience by far.Update May 2017 - They seemed to have streamlined the software code.  Running better.  Still kind of slow but a useable experience."

When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it's going to get?! If this is it, I can't help wondering what its point is."

The sound is good and it's handy, but each time I've used it when I'm done listening and want to move on, I can't seem to find a way to turn this app OFF!  None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop.  Very hard to find a way to close the app.  I've ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times.

They are not in the amazon music file or amazon mp3 file thet must download with the app.  That is all empty.

It has high quality music and I really love that you can even read the lyrics and sing-along with the song of your choice! It's very convenient for me since I don't need to go online and search for the lyrics of the song! My only problem is that sometimes I find it really hard to look for a certain song. Whenever I tried searching for a specific song, it's not the right one. So I have to go and look for the albums one by one. It's a hassle for me. Hope they'll fix this though."
11923,"Amazon",2014-06-17,1,"Cumbersome and buggy   Two primary things about this app.1. It constantly loses your playlist options. Add a couple songs, switch to a new album to add some more and the first ones are gone making it impossible to play songs from more than one album. Same artist loses track as well.2. The UI for the application is one of the most difficult to navigate compared to other music apps. Be prepared to tap through screen after screen to find what you want. Items with a prime discount are not clearly represented and intermixed with everything else, as well as one screen showing you they're $0.00 and another showing the same song as one you have to buy for $1.99. Also be prepared to have 1/2 the songs on an album free to stream but you have to pay full price for the album. Not sure if that's due to an industry deal or not but seems bogus when buying the other half the songs costs less than the cost of the album.I was very excited when I thought I might be able to listen to music on my phone instead of carrying an iPod as well as the phone, but I'm keeping the iPod. Amazon has created just one more mediocre half-baked Amazon product. Very disappointed but not at all surprised."

I can understand occasional hiccups with such a vast repository, but this Amazon Music library system is well beyond buggy.If I had to guess, I'd say the app is actually working as intended, but the database and index system that exist in the cloud is so anemic and antiquated, that it can't handle the simple and fundamental functions that I've come to expect from a music library application.Please review and consider an overhaul, Amazon.

11958,"Amazon",2017-01-15,2,"Not a worthwhile service.   The selection is much smaller than most other streaming services, and Amazon Music doesn't even have all of the music which Amazon sells, meaning I can't even use it to listen to many of the CDs I bought with Amazon.Then, if I want to download my music I've bought with the ""AutoRip"" that Amazon emails me about every time I buy a compatible CD, that's awful, too. If you buy a CD on BandCamp - a much better service if you're buying albums digitally - it asks you what file format you'd like. Amazon Music doesn't; Amazon Music says you'll get .mp3 and you'll like it. Of course, Amazon Music doesn't give you just any .mp3, because they had the forethought to give you your music in 292kbps. That's right, Amazon Music gives you decidedly lower quality music than other services. For a service built around music, Amazon Music should offer at a minimum 320kbps or V0.If you care about quality, I wouldn't bother.

As far as I am concerned this is the best perk to Amazon prime.The best thing for me is when in NYC subway, my phone has no signal between stations, but yet Prime Music works 90% of the time.

IIRC, it wouldn't install at all on my Coolpad Quattro cellular, further making it of little use.  Works okay on my various PCs, where I also utilize strong competitors such as Pandora, Spotify, or Slacker. I would have given it only 2 stars except I do like the categorical choices for the stations (when I can see them!)."
11995,"Amazon",2012-12-13,5,"Great MP3 music player   I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily.  It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player.  Easy interface to use and browse your music.My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album.  I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause.  Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well.  Try listening to Wagner:""The Ring Without Words"" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts.  I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review.  Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other.  I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended."

The benefits of this program are worth the price of a prime membership. You can listen to almost every artist for free. The albums and playlists that are free have the prime banner on them and show the price as $0.00. I mention this because you want to be careful as the app sneaks in some suggested albums that cost money. Customers can listen to music ad free!!!!

12007,"Amazon",2016-11-23,1,"Amazon Music is Terrible   It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music.  If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole.  You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album.  Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time.  It requires you to do that song by song.  Terrible.  I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music."

These are original mp3 or m4a files. I don't understand what the problem is. Some play, some don't. Why?I did find a workaround that involves uploading, downloading, and then uploading again. That's right: upload the song, then download it back to your computer, delete the original uploaded song from Amazon's cloud server, and then re-upload the downloaded song. It appears that certain things are delete from the original uploaded, such as lyrics. Maybe Amazon doesn't like certain lyrics? Who knows!!!"

I have 1 account I use for apps and a different account I use with a  prime membership. All worked well for me prior to single sign on. When Amazon introduced single sign on, instead of making things easier they made everything more complicated and broke things in the process! Initial, after installing the Amazon app store you could sign in using a different user after downloading and installing Prime Music. Trying to sign in with a different user using the Amazon store app did not work. No things are reversed. Sign in with a different user works with the Amazon store app but no longer works with the Prime music app. Amazon, do us all a favor, get rid of your broken implementation of &#34;single sign on&#34; please!!!"

12051,"Amazon",2015-07-05,2,"Mediocre interface, frustrating glitches, and limited library   The interface it not the easiest to navigate and makes it difficult to perform actions on songs/albums while actively playing music. The process of having to first find a song in the Amazon library, then figure out if it is a Prime music track or only available for additional fee, and finally having to move the song from the Amazon library to your library before being able to play the entire thing is tedious. I should be able to have a standing filter that only shows music I don’t need to pay extra for and I should be able to stream whatever is presented without having to first add it to some other library. The radio feature is limited to preset stations. There is no continuous playlist option to supplement the active playlist with a radio selection based on the most recent playlist selection.As far as glitches: When you are lucky enough to find the song you want, and have it be part of the Prime offering, then you have the issue of actually playing the track. Often when trying to add a new song to my library it will indicate it has been added, but then when I go to play the song nothing happens. Sometimes the song will play after a minute or two, but other times you have to exit the application completely and relaunch it to get the new songs to play. This is very frustrating when you simply want to listen to a new song!And the good stuff: Once you start to play a track there are no hiccups in the audio output. You’d think this would go without saying, but a lot of the steaming services that have web based players don’t seem to be able to get this right, including Spotify and Google Music. Having an application on the desktop is one way to assure smooth playback, although some services seem to be able to make good web players that can do this too. Also, the quality of the recordings sounds good to me, with no loss of quality that I could readily notice due to the applied compression."

Over the past few years, it's only grown progressively worse.  It's like a schizophrenic mishmash with poor organization, and as counter-intuitive as possible.I've always bought my digital music on Amazon, but between this extremely poorly thought out app, and the fact that one has to be very careful wading through multiple ""tribute"" band titles when shopping for any music to find the music you actually want rather than ""tribute"" band crap...

It seems to have removed the ""lock screen"" controls, which was really the reason I used this app.  Looks like I'll be migrating over to another music player, which is a shame as I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem and that's where I was getting most of my music.  I'm totally regretting downloading this update and am considering looking online to see if anyone has the old version so I can go back.  PLEASE AMAZON, FIX THIS!UPDATE 12-12-13: There was an update that fixed a few minor issues but still did not bring back the lock screen controls.  And now, when using the Amazon mp3 app, some of my songs cut off half-way through for no reason.  Really frustrating.  I've now migrated over to GoneMAD Music Player.  It seems to burn through my battery faster than the old (working) version of Amazon mp3, but at least it has lock screen controls which is really helpful when listening at work and I have to pause music when I get a call.  It makes me both sad and angry when developers try and tinker with a perfectly good app and render it almost useless.  Let's be honest here...this app really was a gateway for Amazon to get us to use their Cloud Player and buy music through their service.  And I understand that and was OK with it.  I'll use your store...just give me an app that has some halfway decent features and works and we're good.  You had that, but now the app is bunk.  Just maddening.

12091,"Amazon",2015-02-05,5,"The best thing is most of it is completely free and ...   Wow! IMO, this is the one big thing that Prime was missing and now, membership is completely worth it with this feature. I am a HUGE music fanatic on the Amazon Student Prime trial and this has been the highlight of it. Since they recently added the ability to stream whatever I want AND add it to my library, I am ecstatic! I thought there had to be a catch, but lo and behold, I clicked the songs I wanted and saved them to my offline library. I'm excited because I do not have to worry about any viruses on my phone, etc, because all of these albums and songs are found in the Prime library and they have EVERYTHING, and I mean, EVERYTHING. They have 3 seasons of Victorious soundtracks, 150 songs by Veggietales and of course, music everyone actually listens to (Top 40, EDM and even some Indie Rock).The best thing is most of it is completely free and it is so easy to use. I think the previous reviews were outdated because it is extremely user friendly. Just make sure you check if the songs are free or not, there is an option to search only Prime eligible so that rules out any costs. But like I said, the majority are free and you'd expect them to be like 1-star freebies, but nope, you have the Pharell, Vance Joy and Meghan Trainor album available.My only qualm is that the ""genres"" aren't exactly accurate. They definitely need to make an Indie category instead of classifying MGMT as EDM lol and they classified Sara Bareilles as Rock. Ha. But not enough for me to take away a star. I am a highly satisfied customer! Haven't had any problems besides when I download a few too many albums at a time, then it crashes once in a while, but I see that more as my problem and impatience for downloading so much, than the app. I wondered how this would benefit them at all but I realized a lot of people would probably be more willing to stick with their Prime memberships (I probably will) and some of the songs that are able to purchase make you WANT to purchase them because everything else is free.**Again, keep in mind this is written in the perspective of someone who currently has an Amazon Prime Membership, which has made it completely worth it!

Since marshmallow I can't update your app. I keep getting the 505 error code even after clearing the cache & data from both Prime & Google Play Store.

Without this ability, the App is pretty much worthless for those who stream music to a remote stereo via wifi.On edit: Apple might be most to blame for not allowing streaming to multiple locations. If one option/clicks the speaker icon in the bar at the top of the finder screen, you do have the choice to pick a streaming location. Unfortunately, you can only choose one location at a time, so if you want to listen to music from your computer as well as remotely, you're out of luck.

Having purchased a samsung Tab Pro 10.1 I was hppy to find my old friend Amazon Music available for Android. Iinstalled it, and once i figured how to download my favorite albums Iwas in hog heaven, until my tablet suddenly stopped being able to download anything.The idiot app was stashing all downloaded music in device storage, so my puny 16Gb of device storage ws all gone while my 64Gb of SD memory was sitting gloriously empty except for some pictures from the camera and some tunes I'd burned via USB from my PC, which went to sd memory as God intended. This behavior continued despite me moving the app to SD. Happily, bringing up the app's on-device list allowed me to easiy delet about 3Gb of music I didn't really need, so I was able to download a bit more stuff I really DID want with some room left over for apps and whatnot.Since the app cleverly hides the downloads from the outside world, I am unable to transfer the music to a less horrendously unreasonable location. GRRR! Since I spent a very long career as a software developer for a top flight skunk works, poory designed software makes me VERY angry, VERY angry INDEED! If it wasn't for this rabidly user hostile feechur, I'd have cheerfully given this this a 5 rating! I'll be transferring 20 gig or so of tunes from my PC to the SD chip - thank heaven Amazon Music is able to see and use such files.One other small quibble: unlike the PC version, there's no volume control in the app - you have to tweak the system volume.

In my case, my 8GB phone (Moto G LTE) will run out of space quite quickly.Athough my android Android 4.4.3 KitKat shows the move app option, it does not work!I am seriously looking into a different ecosystem which has an app that allows me to store music on the external micro SD (32 GB).

If there was a way to upload more legally purchased music to the cloud for playback, I would be sold. This aspect of personal music storage is a huge selling point for Amazon Prime Music versus online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have. What I'd love to see is a way to sync or play music from the cloud that I've purchased elsewhere either via cd or digitally.

12138,"Amazon",2014-07-19,3,"If they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear   It's okay but only as a secondary music solution for you. First of all, I was super disappointed that ""free music"" really meant ""some free music"". The promotions and even the website make it seem like Prime members have access to full library for free. But then you start searching for songs and see all these price tags. It's super confusing until you realize you only have access to an oddball conglomeration of tunes. Their categories are horrible. I mean, when I see Pop as a category I think it's going to be today's pop music - not Pop songs from decades past. There's no ""today's hits"" section, top 40, or anything like that. And don't get me started on the weird music collections they've assembled. Who are these people who put together playlists? Absolute rubbish. All that aside, if you want to hear some old Journey or AC/DC album in its entirety, you can do that, so there is some value to the service, although if they cancelled it tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. You could totally survive without this mediocre service."
12142,"Amazon",2014-09-09,2,"Not Impressed!  Needs VAST improvements!   First - I have a Galaxy 3 and use the android app.  The previous Amazon MP3 music app wasn't the best.  I had to turn it off by putting the screen on the song and clearing the queue, but once I figured that out, it was an okay app.  The new app that includes Prime is much worse.  It will not shut off at all!  I have to go to settings and sign out for it to stop running; therefore, I have to log in every time I want to use this app.  Also the free music is full of tribute bands.  Really Amazon?  I'm starting to think that the only thing good about Prime is the two day shipping.  My kindle only allows borrowing once a month, and it doesn't take that long to read a book.  I am NOT impressed Amazon!"
12143,"Amazon",2014-06-14,3,"Amazon mp3 Was Better   I've had my galaxy 3 tab for about 5 months now, and had just gotten used to Amazon mp3, when they came up with this new app.  I'm sure the app has some nice features, which I haven't explored yet, but there is one thing fundamentally wrong with this new app, wich for me, makes it multiple times less functional than the old app.  That is it''s portrait only orientation.  Why is it so?  Because when trying to create playlists, I can't read an entire id tag because it's too long.  If you listen to classical music with the opus numbers at the end of the tag, you know what I mean.  Fix this, and all the other glitches, Amazon, and you get a 5."

Even using the app for PC it isn't  as intuitive as itunes. Have to get into too may screens to select stuff. Tunes get stuck in the play back too if its playing from the cloud so I just download to device to bypass the cloud. The service of Amazon Music with Prime is excellent. Quick downloads, great selection. Prime music doesn't always work. Give it a rest and try back another time and it may work."

12158,"Amazon",2014-08-04,5,"Wonderful edition to Prime!!!  Wonderful music app!!!  Such an unexpected value!   Love this music app!  I am a lover of many different genres of music.  From 70's, Disco, Funk, Orchestra, Burt Bacharach, Easy Listening, Classic Rock, Tons of Christmas, etc. etc.  I previously used Pandora and I ¢¾ Radio.  Those are great apps; however, I found this to be so much better!  I bought the Prime membership at Christmas last year to save simply on shipping.  It was well worth it.  As a whim, I decided to try the music app.  I had no idea how much I would be able to access and download FREE music that I love!  I was quickly creating my own playlist.  I have created quite a library with so many different types of music.  I now listen in my car using my Iphone and listen at home using Kindle Fire HD or Iphone.  I think selecting and purchasing music is quick and easy.  I find all of the process easy.  The only warning is some songs that are free are ""rerecorded"" so watch for that and play samples before purchasing.  Those songs are the minority, but can happen.  If it does, it is easy to delete the song from my cloud or device. I really like creating custom playlist from my library.  It is a wonderful app!I am wondering why so many people have such negative reviews.  I haven't shared their experiences at all.  Perhaps it depends on so many factors such as devices, Wifi strength, etc. etc.  I have had a wonderful experience with it.My only fear is I am building a huge library and wonder if it will fill my device.I love the app!  I think it is well worth joining Prime if you do not already have a membership. I actually opened the app on my birthday as a whim.  Since that day, I feel that Prime is gifting me with more and more music.  I simply search for artist and songs.  Most of the time, there are free offering for most all music I love.  I am thrilled beyond words!Yes, I have purchased some music also.  I have found that many selections I like have a great price on the CD which also includes the MP3 download for free.  So I receive my CD in the mail and have my digital music on devices.  This is a great gift in itself.  I can save the CD as a gift for older family members who do not use digital devices and enjoy the music myself.You will find Prime Music a wonderful tool for listening, collecting, and organizing your music library."
12159,"Amazon",2017-08-18,2,"Nice Music Selection, Poor & Frustrating User Interface   Great music selection available, but the user interface sucks. To delete an album from your library you have to delete EACH SONG 1 by 1! That's really bad by design IMHO. Why force users to waste time like that? Frustrating."
12160,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Updates to the app deletes content for all device playlists - forces streaming.   I have and use this app daily.  But the last two updates wiped out my device playlists.  The playlist screen even has a little button to toggle between device and cloud.  worked until the updates.... rebuilt the playlist on the device.... today's update?  wiped out the playlist that was local.  I don't want to have to hook up to every strange wi-fi signal I can get to stream my music - I download and play.  Wiping out playlists is just wrong."
12162,"Amazon",2014-07-21,1,"Eats data like it tastes good.   I've been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years.  I've generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I'm not super tech savvy.  My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it's a pain in the rear (apparently my files couldn't be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album wouldn't).  My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I'd have to re-learn where everything was again.  But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to 4.0.4.Which has sucked.  I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed.  I've found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason.  I'm not a big data consumer.  My average data use over the past year or so doesn't usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month.  I'm on Wi-Fi more often than not (at home and at work, so I'm usually only streaming 3g/4g in the car).  Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I'm close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over 700 mb of data.In 4 days.When I'm not using the app, I close it.  It restarts itself.  I close it again.  It restarts again.  And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off.  Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I've never had before, and I'm not just disappointed with the app.  I'm pretty well disgusted with it.  If I'm in my car, I can't fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it's still buffering.  It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I've now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi.  Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I've used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I won't likely abandon it right off the bat.  I'll take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library (again), and move on.  In the meantime, I'm peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app won't just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I've previously enjoyed and recommended to others.  That won't be happening again."
12172,"Amazon",2016-04-04,1,"Frustrating, lackluster - I thought Amazon would be a leader for the cloud music experience.   This app is incredibly frustrating, and the effectiveness varies by device.  I have it on two rokus, two pc's, my iphone, my ipad, and amazon fire.  1.  I am a super-user, in that I have over 80k songs in my cloud subscription (which says storage is for ""up to 200,000"" - yeah, I know, ""up to"", but it keeps accepting my songs).  I kept getting a message that my (PC version) library couldn't be loaded because it had over 40k songs.  2.  When I try to get in to my library, I get the black computer screen of death that says ""ah fiddlesticks, if you continue to see this message, contact amazon"".  I see that message so often, that I just don't even bother.  My cache is clear, my computer is up-to-date.  Tiresome.  3. Because of problem #1, I thought I would open a SECOND cloud to split my library.  Wellllllll... Now it tells me that my computer can only be associated with ONE cloud account.  This is just my experience with the PC version.  It works well with Roku, except that I do not get prime.  It works okay with the Fire, but the interface with either is somewhat clunky for a large library.  I am phasing out not only using this app, but purchasing digital music from Amazon."

The only positive thing is the integration with Echo. In Android, the interface is not user friendly. It's way too many clicks to get to your playlists and the ui is not intuitive. The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated.

I will preface this by saying I have a Fire TV, And a Fire stick, yet My Roku Stick's app will not let me stream Amazon Prime Music unless I own it. Why is the app features not the same across the board? Amazon has always claimed they didn't make a lot of money on the hardware but it was a way to entice people into joining Amazon Prime. I probably should not be venting on this site but maybe someone will listen. I still like Amazon Prime but there are some chinks in the armor.

12222,"Amazon",2011-09-15,3,"Frustrating because promising   This app frustrates me far more than any other on my phone (an Atrix).  I uploaded all of my music onto the cloud player in the hope that it would finally unify all of my fragmented music collections; it has done so fairly well on my various computers (though the tagging and ""Unknown Artist"" issues still pose problems), and I love the browser interface.  However, the android app needs a lot of work on the core functionality.  If it worked as it's supposed to it would be spectacular, offering the capability to buy a song from the store, then switch to the cloud player and play it instantly.  It would also free up all the sd card space that music eats up (at least while you can stream it over wifi).  In practice, though, it just doesn't offer the experience it promises.  It force closes about 60% of the time I try to use it.  When I try to scroll through the list of artists on the cloud player it stutters horribly (and usually then force closes).  Music playback often skips.  This last issue may be android's fault, as I've noticed it in other players, though never so badly as in the amazon one.  However, I don't experience the other problems in different music players.  Until Amazon fixes these issues, this app is still just another dumb music locker that allows you to download songs so you can play them with some other application.  It's an exciting idea, and the interface would be excellent if it just worked."

I have emailed to request a complete refund, and will up the rating once this occurs.Note: I attempted to verify the bitrates on the album pages, but I was directed to AmazonMP3's app, which didn't offer any product details.I realize that I am being very OCD here,  but as a huge fan of both Amazon and the Archeophone Archives products,  as a consumer, I want the best quality possible. Give me that at a good price, and I'm very happy to spend all my fun money here :)===I bought 4 mp3 albums for the first time over the past few days, featuring acoustic-era phonograph music.

I use this app every night to play my ""Brown Noise"" for sleeping and generally whenever I want to listen music through my phone.Using the app is straight forward, with a simple layout and standard player controls. You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon ""Store"". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"

It is far too complicated to go backwards and ""like"" a song and often ends up in repeating a song over or restarting the song I was listening to.  Pandora is much simpler to use.  I also am disappointed in my ""cloud"" albums.  I've bought MANY a CD from Amazon before streaming became the ""thing"" and VERY few albums are actually available to listen to.  I originally thought the idea that my music that I've purchased over the years being available to be all the time without having to load up space on my phone or always carry my iPod around was a great idea, now with such limited choices, I'm no longer impressed.  My other REAL ISSUE with this app is its own incompatibility with Amazon Fire Stick.  Why in the world would amazon make an App that isn't compatible with one of its own devices?"
12256,"Amazon",2014-06-16,1,"Here we go AGAIN   Another bloated, oversized app with 32 permissions, ridiculous lack of features, wants to sit on the memory of the internal SD, and is unfriendly to older smartphones.

Nyuck THAT.Amazon - If you want families to begin flocking to your Prime club, make the benefits available to ALL ITS MEMBERS and for ALL DEVICES, or they feel cheated for the price they're paying you for Prime, especially after the INCREASE. Got an email today saying this music service is now available for Prime members, so get ready for the big disappointment when the Prime members realize it's just another component that is seriously lacking and not adding to the reasons why one should subscribe."

You have to know exactly what you want to listen to. I don't understand why they don't incorporate an intuitive radio player that you can enter several artists into and then rate played songs to have it learn what to play, basically just like pandora. If they could do this I'd be all in. I will still use prime bc there are MANY other benefits and utilization's for it.If an amazon customer service person see's this, let me know if there is something like this available, bc I REALLY want to use it, the controls and interface (in browser) are just very non-intuitive, much like the rest of amazon's website."
12263,"Amazon",2014-06-29,3,"Decent app, subpar widget and notifications   As a prime subscriber, I was pleased to have this additional service added. I don't enjoy making playlists, and I always opt to use premade or instant playlists. Amazon offers playlists that cater to my tastes, and which include some songs I like that I don't otherwise have in my library. In that respect, I really like what Amazon has brought to the table. That said, I do have a few issues with the app. Streaming on my PC is perfectly fine, but the streaming playback on my Android phone is always choppy at the beginning of each song. My LTE coverage is perfectly good, and Google Play has never had trouble streaming on my phone. My second issue with the app is that it wipes out the active playlist after a few hours of being paused. I want to get out of work and just push play and pick up where I left off. I don't want to have to find that playlist again and figure out where I was. The last issue I have is that the notification tray play button doesn't work for me. This might have to do with the fact that my playback is always paused via unplugging an auxiliary audio cable, but the play button should work regardless. I don't have too much to say about the fullscreen app itself, as I only use it to pick my playlist."

Additionally, it's free with Prime, so unlike competitor's apps (Spotify), I'm not paying $9.99 a month for this.  That having been said...I use Spotify 90% of the time, and Amazon Prime Music the other 10%, largely only for music Spotify doesn't have.  It's all in the UX/UI:  The interface here leaves most things to be desired, and that's the whole ball game."

No. I just want to listen to it.Add to my playlist. Go to Playlists. It's not there.Maddening. It took me far too long to figure out how to play a song... but then it's got to be specific songs.

It handles fairly well, at keeping your music safe so if you can download it over again, and have your autorip music stored here, so if your buying for your friends or keeping your online music safe, this handles well as a must app for your Android devices and Kindle Fire as well. Sadly though, it doesn't have enough recognition with tablets Micro SD cards to play back the music stored there. Also, it could have better playback for when you are playing your cloud-stored music through Wi-Fi.

It ran on my Samsung Galaxy in the same manner.  Now I absolutely abhor this app.  Trying to download an album without the 1000 error code is not possible for me.  Now instead of trusting that the entire album has been downloaded I need to double check.  It is not my network connection nor the network.  I run in to these problems at home, work, even when running 4G as the only wireless connection.  I now have a note 3 and these same problems persist.  Not impressed at all.There are other issues with the app such as when the ""red exclamation"" (indicating a download error) icon appears on the ""Song"" line.  Quickly touching this icon should take you to a pop up screen asking if you want to retry or cancel the download.  Half of the time when I hit that button the player opens and tries to play the song.  Very annoying when you are in a meeting and trying to stay awake:)"
12307,"Amazon",2015-06-02,1,"0 Stars should be an option   It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song, meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST, so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away, so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as ""Free"" music. I never thought I could dislike a music service more than Pandora... but this takes the poo cake."

Is there any way to revert back to the old app, or is Amazon going to address this issue?  Having read the other reviews here, I can see that I'm not alone.

When using Amazon Music on the Firestick TV the play/pause, forward, and reverse buttons on my remote do nothing, unlike Pandora.  I also noticed that unlike Pandora on the Firestick TV, the artist and titles of the songs don't pop up when changing if in another app.  Seems Amazon did much less developing on this than Pandora did.

For some reason this app only lets you download music to your internal memory.What does that mean you ask? Well, Android users have this awesome feature where you can add memory to your phone using a micro SD card. Usually we add these for apps like Amazon Music because music and video can take up a lot of memory. Especially if you're a music lover. For some reason this app doesn't allow you to save music to you SD memory, just your internal, which is usually only 16 gigs or so.If your device has a lot of internal memory then by all means go crazy with this app, it's pretty awesome.

I went through amazon support for this and they recommended I uninstall and reinstall the app so I did. Same problem. Amazon Music was using a large % of CPU even ever closing the app. Support told me I needed to force close it. How about coding a quality app that I don't need to force close, Amazon?

12417,"Amazon",2011-08-24,5,"Best of the Best   I am an Amazon MP3 convert. I first learned about the Amazon MP3 store when clicking buy on a song I liked from the slacker radio app.  I have been hooked since. I have an approximately 6 GB music collection in iTunes and to my dismay, around 1/3 of them are DRM protected.  While my wife is happy to purchase an iPhone, I would like to listen to my paid music on my computer AND on my Droid.  Amazon MP3 to the rescue. The DRM free music allows me to listen stream my music from the Amazon cloud or download it and listen to it on my Droid, desktop computer, or laptop computer.  All of this for the same price (and often cheaper) as iTunes.I am also a participant in Google Music Beta but have found the Amazon player to be more to my liking. Not only does Amazon provide the ability to purchase music and download it directly to your cloud drive but the storage of music in your cloud drive is a free service.  I did not realize until recently that the storage for music purchased directly from Amazon MP3 is not included in the 2 GB quota that is provided for the free cloud service.I am also suspicious of Google's music beta. Don't get me wrong, I love Google and Google products and they have a track record of providing free services that offer alternatives to current paid services (often at potentially expensive costs to the company while upsetting competitors). However, the clause in Google Music Beta on the App Store that says ""Free for a limited time ..."" makes me nervous that they are waiting for people to upload their entire music library, become dependent on the service, and then start charging a subscription fee for storage or bandwidth.But I digress. With Amazon MP3 purchase and download to your hearts content without worries about running out of cloud storage space or hidden or future costs. Then enjoy life streaming your music or downloading it to listen offline in areas where your reception is not so great (or if you do not have a unlimited data plan)."

If it has to do with piracy then you should know that anyone who wants to illegally download content can do it with ease and by not enabling your store on the international stage you are only hurting yourselves.

I would avoid using this app at all costs until the problem is solved.It's a shame, given that I would have previously rated this app as a four-star app: I was genuinely happy with it before.  Of course, that was back when it was still functioning."

Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can't even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I'm usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but... AMAZON FIX YOUR APP, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!Though, from the sounds of all the other reviews, I'm better off not having it on my devices to begin with. Guess I dodged a bullet?

Sorry to shout people- AMAZON, JUST LET US DOWNLOAD OUR MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT YOUR STUPID ADVERTISING. IT'S NOT WORKING. Whew!

I still use Amazon Music for MP3 because there's nothing better, but for now I'll just manually copy the MP3s to my phone and use Google Play Music app to play the songs while I am jogging.Dear Amazon: until you change the behavior of this application back to where it's not violating our privacy, I am not using your app.  Fix that, and I'll reinstall it."

And being able to create your own playlist is a missing feature that I must have. But, as a benefit that I did not expect from Amazon, I have no complaints.  If I didn't have Prime, I would probably skip this."

This is annoying as hell as i get skips, etc that there should be no reason for.The recommended stuff lists are of no use to me... but there is no way to kill it.I think once my free preview of the service is done... i'm letting it go."

12500,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music   I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update.  Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their  device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted."
12505,"Amazon",2011-09-05,5,"I bought an HTC Android device for this reason   I thought it was neat when it came out.  But I only had a ""stupid phone"" not a ""smart phone"".  I wasn't eligible to get a ""smart phone"" until Oct 2010.  It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive.  Just go get on amazon...sweet!  However, I wanted one of those smart phones.  I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed.  However, waiting gets the best of us.  I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet.  I thought the 7"" display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you.  And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT.  It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I didn't.  This way I get what I wanted (android stuff) and I didn't have to wait.But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I'm in the middle of dishes and I can't get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it's available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier.  I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems.  No searching this folder or that.  I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.The only thing I didn't like was that for some reason I can't figure out how to not download a whole album...but that doesn't take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player :)If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great. I am currently shopping for music as we speak ;)"

Been using this since Amazon Cloud Player, and the new updates are less than thrilling.As another reviewer pointed out, you can't make and save playlists to cloud. I run amazon music on my laptop and phone, and playlists have to be made separately for each device.More annoying still is that imported mp3s to my phone are being made into weird albums. Any album with more than one artist contributing (soundtracks for instance) are separated into as many ""albums"" as there are artists in said album. This is ridiculous. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be any manual way to fix it.Aside from these two major irritations, the app functions as advertised. Otherwise I would rate it lower."

I would be fine with the concept of saving internally and then copying to external, but if you do that, you lose the playlist you downloaded to your phone.  There is no 'playlist' file that can be transferred or updated to find the newly relocated music.  Now you just have a playlist on your phone that has '0' songs in it.Storage location is a must for this type of app."
12544,"Amazon",2012-12-30,4,"My choice from the three contenders   Choosing the right ""cloud"" solution for my music collection was a journey of trial and error. The complication arose out of my cross platform use.  I run a PC laptop at home, Apple TV, an Android tablet and Iphone on the go.  If I used a Mac, iphone, and ipod perhaps the choice would have been easier, except that I like my music in MP3 format, so even though I use iTunes for my collection at home, I do not buy music from the Apple Music Store.  I buy my music from Amazon.Having the Amazon MP3 app available on my iphone and my Android tablet makes it easy to access my music from any device.  The apple version of the app even lets me stream through my home stereo using Apple TV. I tried the free Google Play service but found it to be utter crap as I was not able to access my online music on an Android tablet.itunes match did not work for me as there is no Android app for it, and it does not store music as MP3.  I highly recommend Amazon's Solution."

I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is ""cool"", but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:1) Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I'm playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity isn't an issue.2) Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I've seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very ""tinny"" sounding. It's not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.3) Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. ""Random"" should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.4) Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere."
12553,"Amazon",2015-03-28,1,"DON'T USE THE AMAZON MUSIC APP FOR PHONE STORAGE   Amazon, I keep starting to love you then learn why to do otherwise. Right now, it's that amazon music needs to use the phone's SD card for music storage!! How stupid are you to make an app I can use to let my kids access my music library and then make it crash all three of our phones unless we regularly, manually, move music to the sd card!??!! VERY STUPID and QUITE LIKE THE TAIL END OF A DONKEY, is my answer.Then, when you move the files, if they're sunc from the cloud, it wants to start putting them back and pretty soon the phones are crashing again for lack of internal memory. Bite us!"
12554,"Amazon",2012-08-21,1,"Great idea, terrible performance   I uploaded all of my music, nearly 300 gigs, to my Amazon Cloud. The idea was that I'd have all of my music available no matter where I went as long as I had wifi or a cell phone connection. The problems began right away whenever I tried to access my cloud using this app. Often it would take 20 or 30 minutes just to bring up a song and the app would crash multiple times. It was terrible! I called cust service and was told by the rep there that they have the same problem. Their solution? Download the music to my device because the app was unreliable. This totally defeats why I got the cloud subscription and downloaded this app. It sounds like a great app but like most things with Amazon they rush them out and their performance is not stellar.

I have so many credits built up,to just sit there and go to waste because my Mach Speed Trio is not compatible. Rather than it not being compatible with my tablet,I do love this! I had this on my old phone and it was awesome how easy it was to find albums,random music,and specific songs.It was super easy to get to the music and download it(purchase it with credit) and not to mention the bonus credit you get when you purchase other apps through the amazon store or buy stuff off of Amazon. 4 stars all the way,would have given it 5 if it was compatible with my tablet.

But this dang player has a couple of serious flaws. Foremost is the fact that I can't store my music on my external SD card. WTH Amazon? I see comments on this function going back for years and you still haven't added it? Are you figuring we'll all just stream? Do we all look like we've got unlimited data plans?  Let me store my music on my external card!  At this moment, I'm uploading my music to Google to give them a spin.If I go with them for storage and playback, guess where I'll be buying my music?Not asking for much here...As Beth Hart sings so incredibly well, ""Get your s*** together."""

Pandora obviously has a much more sophisticated algorithm to learn the listener's preferences in music."

12601,"Amazon",2011-08-06,4,"Excellent, but not ideal yet   The concept of this cloud player has some wonderful benefits -- same library of content available to all your devices, regardless of where you are.  The fact that Amazon's library is based on the open MP3 format instead of any DRM format also makes it much more robust and useful.  This is the first serious competition to Apple's iTunes w/o most of the headaches associated with that platform.  However, there are some issues that should be addressed to make this a more robust player:1) The ability to d/l a playlist to your device without downloading the space-consuming songs in that playlist.2) The ability to shuffle the songs in a playlist.  Google Music can do this, and it is one of the few things it can do that Amazon Cloud Player can't.  This should be a simple s/w fix.3) When you display the list of all songs, it would be nice to see what playlist each song belongs to, if any.  It's a chore to search your entire library to find any orphaned songs.There are other features that I could request to make this a dream app, but these features alone would make it much closer to ideal for me.  Add these features, and I would give it a full 5 stars."

12628,"Amazon",2014-07-22,5,"I will NEVER use iTunes again!   It took me about one week to figure out all the the INs-and-OUTs of the app on my iphone.  All I can say is that I will not EVER use iTunes again.  I have a total love affair with my iPad and iPhone, but I have never had any great love lost for iTunes.  Now with this really great application, I will not ever worry about it again...ever.First of all--if for nothing else--there are more than a million songs available on Prime Music.  You have to do nothing more than choose the music you want to listen to then download it to your device (even prime music can be downloaded to a tablet or smart phone).  When it has been downloaded to your tablet or smart phone, then you can listen without streaming.  Hours and hours of music, and a whole host of it for free!  There are also pre-created playlists that Amazon suggests, and you can add this playlist with a simple click, touch, or swipe of the finger!Then any music you have purchased in just about forever is available on your Amazon cloud.  The trick to getting pre-existing music from the cloud to show up on your device is to add a playlist in your cloud (which I just titled ""all my music"") and then select your music to add to a playlist.  Then once it's in a playlist, you can download all your music at once with the download arrow on your device.Also, if you have uploaded music to your Amazon cloud, that music is there, too!After you've downloaded music, if you don't want it, then you swipe the song to the left, and it gives you the option to delete.  (The same left-swipe option allows you to download single songs-instead all your songs-from the cloud.)This application works FLAWLESSLY on my iPhone.  A coworker has an android smartphone, and it works flawlessly on hers, too.This is now my go-to app for all my music.  I do not use iTunes at all.  I can find ALL my music.  I also like the various ways I can look at music, either in a list or individually.  I can mix so that I am playing tunes in random order instead of hearing the same list over and over again. I can listen to my entire Amazon music library on the computer, through my tablet or phone, just practically anywhere.This app is IT for me.  Thanks, Amazon!  Job well done...again and again and again.One more thing: if you're having trouble making the app work for you, then try Amazon's help link for the Amazon Prime Music App.  Go to Prime Music in Amazon, and keep clicking on links that say ""Learn more about Prime Music"" until you get to the Amazon Help.  There, you will find a three-minute video about Amazon Prime Music.  Also there are additional links in the left-hand column (if you're on your PC) that will benefit you, too.Happy listening!!"

At last count, I am up to 26 hours of music on my phone. It takes days before I hear the same song twice. Thanks Amazon!The selection of music is fantastic too. I find everything I am looking for - even new artist singles. Downloads are quick too.My only ask is they update their phone app so I can do thumbs up/down on songs as I listen to them.

I know I have the cd at home, but for some reason it was not on my phone. Thanks to Amazon Music Prime...I was about to go on there, and download it very quickly and we were off singing it all the way home (and kept the driver awake in the process, which was great). It was heaven to have it available and able to download so quickly.

I work in a school so I understand why Lowe's restrictions are there. Amazon.com is not blocked on my computer. Therefore I can utilize the Amazon music service from the computer at work. This save data on my cell phone. Because otherwise I might be streaming music from my phone to make it through the day. I find the interface easy to operate.

Get off your collective rumps, Amazon, and fix this damn app!!!"

For some absolute unkown reason they've disabled that function altogether. The limited internal storage of the phone coupled with the brutal data allowances of verizon handcuff the use of this app at all.I loved having quick and easy access to my mp3 files from virtually anywhere, but now find this app almost useless.  Even went as far as uninstalling the app updates to strip it back down to the original version; which actually allowed the files to be saved directly to the sd card, but found that amazon has completely shut down the ability to sign in.In short....a year ago or less this app was a 5-star.

What I find is that this is an amazing value for Prime Members.  The library isn't as diverse as I would like(but I have very specific and more foreign tastes from the norm) so for most people the selection should be quite nice.

Sometimes I get an Amazon ""internal error"" message, but most of the time it just stops. This is so frustrating, and for such a comprehensive site, it seems really ridiculous."

I like having the non-digital hard copy product along with the digital product.I'd give it five stars, but I don't like that they put identifying info into the digital files so if you share files on the internet they can be traced back to you.( I think they may do that to any media on your device that you play in this service too).

The x-ray lyrics is a great feature as well and follows the song pretty well. At times the x-ray lyrics can lag behind the song but Im pretty sure this is because Im listening via blutooth in my car (happens on utube as well). Overall its an amazing music player with tons of free music and pre programmed stations. Highly recommended!"

But with my Amazon digital purchases they are stored free on my cloud and I can get them anytime anywhere and play them on the web. I dont feel like Im wasting my money because I will always have the music I bought and even other music downloads that I already had on my computer because I can import the songs I didnt buy from Amazon.

So, the small MP3 player I just purchased on the Amazon website to use while I am running, the MP3 player that just plays music files and doesn't load apps, the MP3 player that I will now be returning to Amazon, is totally useless. They should show this information in big bold letters from the get go instead of leading you to believe that you can download music onto your PC. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY PRIME MUSIC FILES ONTO YOUR COMPUTER. So, really not sure why they are calling these songs you can't download ""Prime music"", certainly makes it seem as though you as a ""Prime member"" would have access is a bunch of crap. I guess they are trying to justify the $99.00 a year fee they charge by giving you what amounts to another Pandora or Spotify. What a waste of time, and now I have an app I have to uninstall as well or maybe I should just run with my Kindle strapped to the side of my head."

The Prime Stations are better than Pandora.  I have even used it to play music for our Oktoberfest celebration.  I have yet to find anything bad about it. The only problem I encountered is that I downloaded so many songs that I ran out of memory on my phone and had to delete some.  They are, however, still in my library in the cloud.  I enjoy the recommendations that are listed based on the music I am listening too.  As a result I have found artists I would not have looked into otherwise.  I highly recommend the service!!!"

Yeah it was my fault for clicking to download my queue 3 times while trouble shooting, but no choice to stop downloading, or remove songs. SUCKTASTIC, MORONIC, SIMPLISTIC, GARBAGE!

12803,"Amazon",2011-04-10,4,"Excellent evolution   I've had and used earlier iterations of the Amazon MP3 Application on my android devices before, but the continued evolution - and integration with general Amazon features - is promising and pleasing. Being able to access both local and remote music files from a single application is an excellent step forward, though it'd be a bit better if they could be in one general listing (challenging as that might be to represent).This could easily become the 'daily driver' player, but like other reviewers I'd love to see two additions:1/ integration with the lock screen (ala Songbird)2/ Support for the scrobbling standards (e.g. with Last.FM or third party scrobblers).Putting these in a review is... unlikely to get a response, but a quick look around I couldn't see how best to add enhancement requests directly."
12804,"Amazon",2014-06-15,2,"Had to uninstall   The new version with the prime music library seems great. Unfortunately when I tried to play a song I just got a revolving circle over the play button, which would not go away. It slowed down the phone completely, drained the battery in minutes and caused it to overheat. I had to uninstall it. Samsung Galaxy II. I repeated it several times to make sure something else wasn't responsible."

So, when I got my new phone and the app, I was happy to have almost my entire music library at my fingertips.Then came August 1st...I am a Prime member, and I remember when I started using the cloud.  They said that songs would not count against my 5GB of free cloud storage.  In fact, the web page still says that.  However, when I went in to my cloud player on 08/01, I got a pop up message saying that I could only have 250 songs imported songs for free.  An imported song is anything you didn't purchase from Amazon (although that is not true because many of my imported songs are from CDs I did purchase from Amazon).So, I have until 08/31 to have all my imported songs on the cloud.  After that, I will need to pay for anything over 250 songs, and I have over 3,000.  It will be $24.99 per year, I believe is what the message said, to keep all my imported songs on there.  Now, just over $2 per month is not a lot of money, but when they tell you that you have 5GB of free storage and that ""This space is yours to use as you like and you will never be charged for it."" (that is quoted from their website) and then they change it on you, it leaves a bad taste.I have deleted all of my imported music from the cloud.  I have been a big supporter of Amazon and bragged about their cloud player and the benefits of Prime membership.  I have also touted the Kindle Fire.  I'm very disappointed with the way Amazon handled this.  I have uploaded all my songs now to Google Music (20,000 free with them) and will just use their player from now on."

First off I would like to say that I love the music Amazon Prime gives me access to and the ability to make so many Playlist, and also the Playlist that prime provides using your genre of music. But, and it's the reason I will most likely not renew Amazon Prime this year, because free shipping and shopping does not make this app. worth $ 99.00 a year. But constantly being unable to listen to a full Playlist is a pain, and it's frustrating. Its not how long I'm listening to the music, because Prime music will stop after 5 minutes or stop every 20 minutes, and I get a notification saying Amazon Prime has stopped. Would you like to report or close program. I have reported it  many times, with no result. So my only other option is to go back to Google Music play. I'm very disappointed with Amazon Prime, I was so excited about the Prime Music, but now it's just frustrating to try to listen to music using Amazon Prime.  I'm writing this review in hopes that someone else has had this problem and found a way around it. Based on the music I would have given 5 stars, but the apps constant stopping rates it at 1 star."

But, there is a very big issue of this app - some users cannot use it, even if they live, earn and spend their money in UK. and this is why, becouse this app only accept english language in our phones.

When the Amazon app for the iTouch and iPhone came out, I was very happy because it worked well and it was easy to play all of the music that I uploaded. Now with this latest update to Amazon's cloud service, it's just like I'm back using iTunes match. A number of my mono tracks have been matched by Amazon and I'm getting the stereo version. I understand why match is available and get why it's a great tool but there really needs to be a way to bypass the match feature so people can listen to the exact mp3 they want to hear, not the one Amazon decides you should listen to. Some of the other tracks I've uploaded come from audiophile releases that sound much better than the ones offered by Amazon. So in these cases, I'm losing sound quality.

Since then, I just get a big orange circle in the middle of the black screen (presumably some sort of ""waiting"" indicator).The search icon is functional, so I can also enter a search term and see that search term displayed between the menu icon and the search icon with the orange circle performing its animation below.

I buy all of my music on Amazon and I like how my music is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere.  I use the Cloud Player to listen to music on my work computer.  I also like that I can choose what to download to my phone.  This app desperately needs the ability to change the download location.  I have a Droid Razr Maxx and on some newer Android devices sdcard/ refers to internal memory and sdcard-ext/ refers to the addon SD card.  AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard-ext/.  I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to, but this app has no option to do that.  Instead it downloads to the internal memory.  Amazon really needs to add the ability to change the download location of the music.  This one flaw mars an otherwise great app."

They updated my phone and it started working great at my house. I went out tonight with just my phone, switched on the exercise trainer and 3G data. It worked great until I got two blocks away from my house and stopped working. I couldn't get it to work again. I called my husband to put my iPod on his car tire so I could have some music to walk to. I was raving about it to two other friends who have EVOs but now I'm going to tell them not to even bother because it only works over WiFi. Completely useless for my needs. HTC EVO 4g"

Since when do I get things I am contractually paying for taken away?"
13754,"Amazon",2013-04-14,5,"love it!   Great! Easy to install and download my music. Would definitely recommend this. Great way to turn my phone into my music player."

13805,"iHeartRadio",2015-12-02,5,"Nice option   Work's well! Good variety of stations, and styles of music. I can turn on whatever kind of programming that I'm in the mood for and not have to listen to whatever automated crap that the record labels and station owners decide is popular!"
13807,"iHeartRadio",2013-01-21,5,"radio worth listening to   What makes iHeart Radio worth while is that you can listen to regular radio stations, or you can creat your own station. I find myself listening to stations in other parts of the USA.  Creating your own personal station is what I like best about this app. so many stations only play what they are dictated to play, it is nice to listen to stations where the music is understandable. If you like music, and are not happy with the local stations, this is the app for you."
13808,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-03,2,"Good when it works!!!   I think that the application was great at first but then it started freezing.When ever I go on it and try to change the music,it says that it is not responding and to wait or close it! I love the app but it is not not behaving.I have tried downloading the app many times but it still won't work on my kindle fire.It is making me very frustrated.If you want to listen to music,DON'T GET THIS APP!!!!"
13812,"iHeartRadio",2013-03-19,5,"iHeartRadio Review   After hearing countless radio stations saying that they are part of iHeartRadio, I figured I'd download the app to my Kindle Fire HD and see what it's all about.  I have to tell you, I was very surprised at the amount of stations associated with the network and the quality of the audio.  I'm going to purchase a Bose Bluetooth wireless speaker and now I can stream radio stations to it as well because of the app.  And, it was free, so how can you go wrong?"

13817,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-27,5,"Great music choices!   I love a very broad spectrum of music. This app does a great job of anticipating music I will like based on music I have requested or liked. The is a fine tune option for more familiar or less. Also the opportunity to find terrestrial radio stations. Nice mix. My go-to for music and talk for my every mood.Mountain Goat are the best!"
13834,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-10,5,"NOTE II   This is a fantastic App. It's smooth. It offers great mixes of your Genre or specific Artists. It also offers local radio Stations in your area as well. If you purchase the Premium Version, it will allow you to record the songs you like as well. I don't ever recommend anything I don't or wouldn't use. I don't believe you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this one."

13838,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-23,5,"Great!   This is a great app.  I put it on my kindle fire and was able to put in my zip code and find my local stations.  I was also able to put in the local station that is playing just Christmas songs.  Then, the grandchildren were able to hit ""scan"" and go through all the stations just playing holiday songs.  By myself, I just put my favorite local station in while I was cleaning the house.  Another cleaning day today.  Looking forward to listen to the radio!"
13840,"iHeartRadio",2012-05-16,5,"best music app EVER!!!!   this app is AMAZING!!!!!! the best radio app EVER! I love it and the fact that its free makes it all the better. all of my friends have Pandora and it has TONS of adds and it gets sooo annoying so when I downloaded this app I was hopeful that it wouldn't have this problem; and it didn't! this app works amazing on my kindleFire and not only do you get to listen to any radio station you can make your own station with your favorite singer or band. if you love to listen to music I would recommend this app."

13848,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-28,2,"I suppose   But I prefer to just listen to music files locally as I don't like listening to hit music. I use it for streaming news and sports on the go though. iHeartRadio app also doesn't offer every station available in your area. Just the ones that are licensed by ClearChannel."

13861,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-30,3,"Core engine works great, finding/tuning stations not so great   The core engine works great, never skips, even with relatively low bandwidth connections.  However, I hate that it forces you to link to facebook or twitter just to bookmark stations as favorite.  I have no need to tell all of my social media what I'm listening to.  Then, the system that's left to merely search a station is clunky, inefficient (huge icons per screen), etc."

13887,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-02,3,"All it does is crash   3 stars. Not because I can review it, but because all it does is crash. Since i won't dump on an app if i can't use it, and I won't go overboard about one that won't run I pick the middle ground."
13888,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-28,2,"Decent offering but limited in my area, Michigan.   I was looking for an FM radio app so I could stream radio through my phone and this was highly recommended so I gave it a try. What I found was an app that allows streaming, but only through a limited amount of stations (5). This may be due to my area or it may not. Good news is it's free so give it a shot and see if it works better for you."

The only thing I see wrong with it is that when I type ""metallica radio"" I want to listen to metallica. Not every other band that exists.

It offers the opportunity to listen to radios stations across the States, so that was my main interest.But it's not user-friendly for the novice. I will change my rating once I've tried this out a little longer."

14309,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-08,4,"not as good as prior version   I have used this for as long as it has been available. The latest versions do not allow the user to save favorite stations unless they have a facebook account, which I do not. The prior versions allowed this, which is obviously a timesaver so as not to have to go searching through multiple cities and stations to get to the ones I wish to listen. Otherwise the selection is quite good and I use it quite often."

14430,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-28,4,"Great music!   Great music but you need to have speakers in the headphone jack to listen to the music pr else it is really quiet. So my advice to ClearChannel who created this would be to make the music LOUDER so we can hear or make the stations turn it up. Now my advice to the buyers would be keep calm and listen to your music with speakers."

What I DON'T like is when suddenly a song, from another of my channels, starts playing, yet the picture shown is a totally different song.

14492,"iHeartRadio",2015-02-12,5,"Better than Pandora!   I love this app! I use it all the time both on the computer and on my Kindle Fire. There are so many things I like about it but it's better to start somewhere simple. In Pandora, when you're first starting out and you want to make your own station, you can't just simply search for a particular song that you like. Whether you like it or not, it's going to show you other songs instead. On IHeartRadio you can listen to the song you wanted to listen to and THEN it'll give you different songs that are similar to the one you listened to. Also another feature I really liked was the fact that you can listed to either songs familiar to your usual songs or songs that are completely different. This a great feature for people trying to figure out their taste in music.I think that the most important feature is NO COMMERCIALS! The only commercial you will ever listen to or see is in the beginning and that's it. Mind you I'm not paying or anything like that for no commercials. I could go on and on about this app but I think it's best to stop here and let you experience and play around with the app yourself."
14493,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-26,3,"It's Okay..I Expected Better   Alot of hurdles in the set up process.  The programming line up appears to be heavily skewed to a very young listening audience.

16442,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-18,2,"it's great. The musical ""channels""   For listening to iHeartRadio radio stations located all over the planet, it's great. The musical ""channels"", meh.  The music channel songs and their composers are incorrect. One channel listed Mozart as the composer of Swan Lake. What! We all heard selections from Swan Lake played over and over just this past Christmas!  It was Tchaikovsky. The so-called band channels weren't exclusive. For instance, the Electric Light Orchestra radio channel isn't limited to ELO songs. Today, I heard Steely Dan, Journey & SuperTramp on the ELO channel. There were too many examples of wrong information. But, no one cares anymore..right, kids?"

17083,"iHeartRadio",2016-06-29,2,"Not as good as Pandora with foreign music stations   The American stations are very diverse, but not the foreign stations The K-pop and J-pop stations only have a few options for artists, it doesn't have any newer artists and I doubt it has newer songs. It also continued to play strange songs on my B.T.S radio. It would claim they were songs by B.T.S but they were not by B.T.S, although the image they presented was of the South Korean hip hop group. Despite the artist mix up and the lack of diversity it was easy to navigate, so it does deserve two stars at least."

22237,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-19,5,"goodbye Pandora   Wonderful station.  I can choose the music that suits my mood."
22238,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-26,4,"Useful app, but wish it was more attuned to feedback.   I love using iHeartRadio on my Kindle to listen to music while I'm in the shower or doing chores around the house. It's nice to be able to listen to my local radio stations and I also enjoy the ""create your own station"" feature. It's cool to be able to hear music I like with the element of surprise you get from radio because you don't know what's coming on next. All with very few commercials.What I don't like is that the ""create your own station"" feature isn't as attuned to feedback as it leads you to believe. When you skip or ""thumbs down"" an artist multiple times, on some stations you never hear that artist again, but on others you'll hear the artist again in a few minutes, and every time you listen to that station."
22239,"iHeartRadio",2015-03-22,5,"AMAZING   I am speechless get this app"

23802,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-13,2,"Listen to local station...bull!   iHeartRadio claims to let you listen to your local station. however today I'm trying to listen to our local college play football which is being played on our local station, but instead all I can hear is real estate today. This is not what I would call listening to my local station. Also, the in-app ads run over important things during the broadcast at my local radio station. also, if my phone goes into sleep mode the radio cuts off.

Bored with radio station choices that were available, I played with my android phone and took advantage of the strong Wi-Fi signal at the outlet. I downloaded the iHeartRadio app and was pleasantly surprised. Music stations that I never heard of from distant locations all over the USA were at my fingertips. Talk readio, Classic Rock stations, Hip Hop, Oldies, Jazz. You name it, you can find it. What a great app!"
25257,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-25,5,"iheart radio   This is a great app it has every song that I asked for and it was really easy to use."
25260,"iHeartRadio",2014-09-22,2,"way better then a mp player   I can enter a song from when in high school and find it mostly. My complaint is if I enter Charlie Daniels still in Saigon this song should come first on play list. My likes are vast from country to rap to heavy metal. This is better then trying to find music I like on the radio in the near southern border of michigan. No static on songs. No pay three dollars for a song. They need to add songs from movies. I rate this two and a half stars. They make it learn my diverse taste and make it with the little adjusting I will rate four or five stars today first day so may improve as I select music."

I connected IHeartRadio to my Alexa / Echo added the IHeartRadio app to my Kindle Fire, listened to part of a few songs  on the Fire. Then I told Alexa to play IHeartRadio and listened to about 7 minutes straight  of commercials. I listen to Sirius XM in the car and change the station when commercials come on. Perhaps I will try it again. Alexa suggested IHeartRadio when I was trying to listen to something on Amazon  Prime that I did not have in my library."

25637,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-04,3,"Three Stars   OK"
25638,"iHeartRadio",2017-04-24,4,"Four Stars: Please read information below   Way better than Spotify or Pandora. It has the current trending songs and stations! You could even create a playlist of all your favorite songs. Its free and there's no adds, so you could listen with no interruption from adds. All you need to do is like or dislike a song then it'll automatically choose songs or stations to play next. It'll also automatically recommend stations for you to listen to.I highly recommend it, the only thing is I wish I could travel and be on this app without paying any money. Another downside is how when you are doing something else or are on a different app, when you bring the menu up or down, you can't like or dislike the song to save it. And when you can't save it by liking it then maybe a whole new song might come up. Or its not on your playlist.  This app is great all in all. Nothings perfect though and no one could ever make life that way. I think that this app may even receive a 4.5. And if you don't like it, remember its free and could be uninstalled. A little blunt but that's the truth. I'm here for the same thing as you, to maybe see if its worth it, to create a review or to expose. But here...There's nothing really to expose."
25642,"iHeartRadio",2013-07-31,5,"Good channels and great music   No complaints, no problems... easily find music I enjoy listening to. I recommend this to anyone.Yall check it out."
25644,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-01,1,"yawn   this app is one of my least favorite apps ever. it has none of the songs I like or stations. just tryed it. Pandora is better. dials there axway to remove my account?"
25647,"iHeartRadio",2012-05-12,1,"didnt have stations from my state   the app sounded cool until I went to pick a station to listen to and there were none from my state. cant really listen to the radio without stations"
25648,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-08,5,"love this app   You don't need a facebook account. When it ask to sign in you just hit maybe later. Love this becasuse I can listen to the radio stations I listen to in my car."
25649,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-29,5,"Love the iHeart Radio App   Downloaded this great Free App to listen to music & other audio when away from home radio or computer.  I love that I can carry my favorite music & radio shows all over my home & outside too.  Never have to miss any part of song or show."
25651,"iHeartRadio",2012-01-10,1,"Won't install on Kindle Fire   Evidently needs modification for Fire. Tapping install button does nothing. tried rebootng Fire; still won't respond. Perhaps there's something I don't know?"
25653,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-22,1,"i am disappointed   I can't even listen to it because the stations keep cutting out every few seconds.  Not at all a pleasurable experience"
25654,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app!   I love so many features about this app.  The custom radio stations one can build are excellent.  Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.  This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.  Thank you for making this available"
25657,"iHeartRadio",2012-06-28,1,"YOU NEED FACEBOOK   don't be fooled by the other high ratings. they only like it because they have facebook. if you dont, then don't buy the app. if you do, then go ahead."

25695,"iHeartRadio",2013-10-06,1,"declined agreement due to fees   Make sure after downloading this app or any other.  This app has a section in the agreement called ""fees"" where it clearly states that although this app is free now,  it reserves the right to charge us fees in the future.  Although (I would hope) there would be a notification before it charges the fee, I don't want to have to deal with any hidden charges."

25737,"iHeartRadio",2016-01-25,5,"I love IheartRadio. I recently had to reset my first ...   I love IheartRadio. I recently had to reset my first generation Kindle Fire. After trying to reinstall the App, the Kindle said that it was Not Compatible with my device. After jumping through hoops to reinstall it. We just turned on the Install from other sources button in the menu and downloaded an older .APK file of the App from the Internet. Using the File Manager App and going to Downloads, we found that Iheartradio installed the older version just fine. The older Iheartradio .apk file is available if you look for it. I just transferred it from my Windows computer to Downloads in the Kindle First Generation and it installed and works just fine. We don't have all the latest Pop Up Video Advertisements but everything about the I Heart App works great. The reason I knew that the New App should work is because we own two of the exact same model Kindles. The second Kindle was not reset and the Newer App is working Great with it. We hope that this will help someone else having problems with the I Heart Radio App."
25741,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-16,5,"Great to have!   Miss the stations in your area?  All you need to use this app are a password and an internet connection.  I've got stations from my local area, NYC, San Diego, and elsewhere. This is a must-have app if you want to listen to a Cumulus Media station on your device.However, this app does not stream international radio (I use TuneIn for that on my device)."
25743,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-16,5,"iHeartRadio - Free music and Internet Radio   I chose this rating because I love to listen to various types of music!  I have the Spotify App where I have a lot of free music stored as well.The only thing I can say that I may dislike the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio is that I need WiFi or cable service so I can access the Internet.  I love this free music App because I can browse several types of music depending on my taste for that day.  I had the Spotify Premium subscription where I could download my favorite music when I signed up for the Amazon Prime subscription.  I enjoyed the Amazon Prime subscription so much and decided to continue with it.  The Amazon Prime subscription is far less than the Spotify Premium subscription, and gives me access to kindle and computerized books, music, videos, television, etc.  Therefore, I cancelled my Spotify Premium subscription and just keep the free online music.I highly recommend the iHeartRadio - Free Music & Internet Radio App because it is free, allows people to access any type of music they desire!  I would highly recommend this App to family, friends, and acquaintances!  I hope my recommendation will entice anyone who reads it to try it out."

I can listen to music from my high school days at work and then find something a little louder once I get home. With the huge collection, I could probably find music from when my folks were dating."
25749,"iHeartRadio",2012-07-18,1,":(   this app was good, until i forgot my password. i asked it to send it to me throgh email. it got there 1 week later. when i put the password in, it said it was wrong! i went back to the email, and wrote down the password. i copied it into the password box, and it still said it was wrong! i think this app is a disappointment. i recommend songza!"

25757,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-22,5,"Super Solid Internet Radio App, Clear Cut Privacy Policy   What a honest, neat app!  First, a quick treatment concerning the permissions.  I did go through ClearChannel's ToS and Privacy Policy, and everything is upfront and optable.  ClearChannel only shares information with 3rd Parties in two cases: a) delegation directly involved in providing app services b) when the user *voluntary* opt-ins for marketing (none of that ""you automatically agreed to get marketed"" guff).  When I initially looked at the social circle registration,  I was able to easily modify what circles could see and be involved in ClearChannel notifications.  The email address registration is the most ""private"" method of registration.  All the permissions requested are legit and used for various app services.There are in-app adverts; however, they only popup once in awhile and in no way impede streaming, nor does one notice them if the device is in Screen Lock while playing.  These simple adverts only prevent you from tapping the Like/Dislike buttons until you ""X"" out of them.  Otherwise, for a freebie radio with custom channels, this is still the most unobtrusive advertising vs pratical function scheme I have seen.As for app design, I have fooled around with various Internet Radio apps in the past and always inevitably deleted them due to bad, confusing, advertising riddled interfaces.  iHeartRadio is the first one that really has a clear GUI.  I did have to do some initial random button pushing to figure out what was what, but in about 6 minutes I had my custom ""Beatles"" channel made and audio commercial-free streaming.  Sweet!  I especially love the mix selector.  Double Sweet!  On top of everything, a moderately low RAM footprint (approx 46mbs during streaming, less than my Chrome Browser).  This app gets 5 solid stars and a Woot!*Addendum: As of 20Jun14, apparently a recent update has done away with the intermittent static adverts and replaced them with a single streaming advert at the beginning, in this case a T Mobile commercial.  Can't exit out of it, but it is rather short and bearable for a free radio service.*"

But then I downloaded this, let me tell you... it's way easier to use simple and I can fall asleep without leaving the music running all night long! To me it's more than just a music player, but there's no words to even describe how amazing and simple it is =). This is just my opinion and I want you all to hear about it."

Awesome app, but no in app volume control, just the kindle volume control, and no scroll to know how long the song is or has left, but if you just want the tunes, and isn't that the whole point of the app, then this app does the job."
25778,"iHeartRadio",2017-01-18,3,"It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work   I picked this becuz I couldn't get Pandora to work on my phone while I was at work.  The only problem is the selections.  This program doesn't have that wide a selection which you choose a station.  Say you choose Katy Perry.  They'll also play Selena Gomez, Demi Levato, and Ariana Grande.  Unfortunately I can think of several others that should come up becuz I ahve the same station on Pandora and they dont.  I could of course just pick a different station but finding something that would suit all my needs is a pain and you can't combine stations or I would have.  It was good enough I guess since I NEED music at work lol"
25780,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-16,4,"overall good app   Pretty good app, lots of radio stations to choose from. Unlike what others said, you do NOT need a facebook account to use this (maybe this was the case in the past, but not aymore). I signed up just using my email, which I didn't mind.My only issue with this app is that it can crash sometimes on my Kindle Fire when trying to open it. Other than that, it works great. Other good radio apps are Pandora and TuneIn Radio (live stations)."

My home town Talk Radio station, out of the blue, dropped the Sean Hannity radio program from their line-up. My calls to their office go unanswered.  It made me question their motives.  So I looked on the internet and found iHeart Radio.  I'm 60 years old and this app is very user friendly, I have no trouble with it.  I can listen to Sean and Rush on WOR radio, in New York City, of all places (I live in WA State),  I give this app 5 stars for easy to use and it works wonderful on my Kindle, or my computer and even on my Windows phone.

The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me.  I'd recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them.  Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON.  LOL."

25800,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-15,3,"Great Access to Music, Lousy UI   Reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content, recommendations, and application's features, functionality, and user interface in both web and mobile versions. Overall, I like the system but hate the app. Here are the details.What I Like:- Huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music- Good album recommendations algorithm provided by EchoNest identifies relevant new albums to explore- Excellent Autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks (i.e., recommended tracks)- Web interface is very usable, providing intuitive navigation to the various featuresWhat I Dislike:- Mobile app's functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically, and can be slow to respond to user navigation. Buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in WiFi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups, such as ""hunting"" for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app.- Mobile app's features are imbalanced; on the one hand, it provides a great many choices for user behavior (social aspects, exploration and discovery aspects, recommendations at the album and track level, etc.) but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc. For example, I have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are ""hot"" in my neck of the woods, yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left-side start-up screen menu that I cannot configure- Much of the app interface's flow seems to differ from that of the web interface, which is confusing- Transparent or ""disappearing control"" UI design in web interface, while trendy these days (e.g., Gmail folder scroll bar) , is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it, and since two-finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame, you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic UI nav function that should be something you don't even have to think about."

Weather it's the apps one uses, or if there in no proper signals which is frustrating (digital! Got to love it!). It still is an awesome app because it has the best stations to choose from and of course setting up your own stations and being able to purchase music you like. It may never be a 5 star app for me (until it can get a clean signal that stays clean for longer than 30 minutes). It always fails when your listening to something interesting (conspiracy much!!!). But it's probably my fault for its failure to totally satisfy me. Still it's worth the download."

25824,"iHeartRadio",2013-05-16,3,"It's okay as long as you like the programming   If you enjoy listening to your local Clear Channel radio stations, you will probably like this app.  You also gain access to numerous other Clear Channel radio stations around the country with various programming formats and genres.  The limitation is that this is pretty mediocre programming.  I'm not a big radio listener due to the lack of variety in the music being programmed.  No matter what the genre, corporate radio manages to play music that all sounds the same.  Since radio plays homogenized sounds, recording companies record music that all sounds the same.  Pretty boring stuff.To be fair, I've not sampled every single radio station offered on this app.  I am familiar with the local stations (typical of the music described above) and what other stations I've sampled seem to have the same programming.  So, if you like this type of music, you'll enjoy this app."

My husband, our kids & some of their friends have installed it & it has ran Rly good, even on their Apple iPhones. Pandora plays too many ads, not enough music. I hardly hear ads on iHeart. ONLY my brother had yet to get it, but that's due to iheart not having 93.3 The Planet, Greenville SC. The next best is AccuRadio, which I have on my Kobo Vox ereader since this app won't install. I'm sure if iHeart would add 93.3 they would get more consumers. A LOT of ppl love The Rise Guys."

No worries about static or guessing what you found while flipping through the stations. You see the station and know exactly what you want to hear. I now listen to Christian K-Love or the Fish while going to sleep at night. There is a sleep timer and an alarm built into iHeart Radio. If there were 10 Stars that is what I would give to iHeart Radio.Thank-you.Sincerely, Linda Clark-Koball"
25871,"iHeartRadio",2013-04-17,5,"This is a great app   I haven't explored all the bells and whistles yet with this app, but so far I am impressed. I got this for my Kindle fire for picking up local stations that sometimes get interferred with by stations coming in from Canada(I live on the North Coast) and my stations come in crystal clear. It is pretty easy to use too. All you need to do is pick your home state(or any other state for that matter) and a city and boom, your listening to that station in real time just like it's in your own backyard. There is also an option to make your own station by picking only the music that interests you. That feature I have yet to explore in its entirety, but when I do, I'll perhaps come back and edit this review. Until then, get this app and enjoy your music! And, one more thing: It's FREE! You'd be denying yourself if you don't at least give it a try. If you don't like it, delete it. Happy Listening from the North Coast!"

I grew up in Southern California and there was one station that I've been listening to since high school. Unfortunately, I ended up moving out of the county and couldn't get the station on the radio. Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD. Personally, I don't bother with logging into Facebook because I have no interest in creating my own stations.

My one warning, when you type and artist/band name, for a personalized radio, you don't just get that artist, you get that and any artist similar....Which is a pro or con depending upon your musical preferences. I find it a pro because I find music I might not have found otherwise, but I can see how it could be a con for some. easy to use."

It does load quickly on a Kindle HD but the interface is a little clunky and takes too much user action to search and the station list, domestic and international, is very small compared to other services.Recommended stations automatically pop up and the developers should take a look at whatever algorithm they use for this feature because most of the stations recommended for me are way off the mark when compared to the stations I have been selecting. It's frustrating.Icons and text are a size geared more for smartphone screens rather than Kindle screens. For a Kindle, it would be more efficient and easier to use if they were smaller."

One thing that became a frustration was the enormous amount of commercial minutes aired each hour on broadcast Radio. After listening to Pandora for several years I became accustomed to commercial free music. I don't care to listen to 20 minutes of commercials every hour."

25952,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-07,5,"iHeartRadio is great.   I live and work in an area where the radio stations are few and they talk alot.I work in a metal building and the radio stations are very finicky about coming in and hanging thru the day.I was using Pandora and I didn't mind them having an occasional commercial, but it totally locks up on commercials and I lose my music.  Very annoying.  I'm constantly having to mess with my Kindle to get the Pandora to work past a commercial.  So I downloaded iHeart.  it's great.  It took a few minutes to download to my Kindle, but so far it was well worth it and it didn't cost anything to download the app thru Amazon.  You have to sign on thru an email or facebook account, but it works great.  I recommend it.  I can listen all day to music or radio stations....totally awesome."

It sure is a lot cheaper than going out and buying the CD's!"
25957,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-21,4,"I use it a lot!   I can find so many great streams, many of my favorite radio stations and local ones I didn't know existed. They even have talk shows! I find myself listening to Science Friday all the time.Their personalization is fantastic! If you have ever used Pandora, you may be familiar with how far off ""similiar"" they can track. iHeartRadio quickly adjusts to your likes and dislikes. I have found many more artists that I enjoy but have never heard of through this app.Only downside is that I can't view individual songs that I have favorited in the past. It may just be me, but I am pretty good at navigating software."

It has a couple of different features that I haven't tried like an alarm clock but it does have a couple different radio stations.  Not tons of stations just a couple from across the country in each different genre of music.  It does have a comedy channel.  For a free app it doesn't have lots of commercials, but every 5 minutes or so you'll get a 5 second commercial. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a way to play radio on your kindle."

Totally love iheart! Recommend it for everyone that loves music. Check it out and see! You're gonna love it too :)"

Seems like your after the teen market here.  Why not call it Teen Heat Radio instead.  You will never attract the older generations beyond 28 years old.  Every station has just about the very same  theme to it,  it gets old very fast.  reminds me of all the 1980's radio stations all in one place."

This happens with nick radio, radio Disney, top 40 FAMILY hits as well as a child's radio.Absolutely ridiculous and absurd."
26033,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-20,5,"requested app   I really request this app. It is a good app. If you want, you can just turn on a music station, get a book, and start reading. Or you can go to the &#34;Perfect for&#34; page to see what music is good for at the time. I think a lot of people request this app also. Plus, you can keep the music playing while at the home screen, when you are reading a book on your device, when you turn your device off, or just playing a game. I think this is a perfect app for any age and person. There is also a sleep alarm and a alarm to wake you up. You can also listen while you are getting an app or rating an app. This is a really perfect app."

About a month in (after some update)  the app would cut out for no reason and make no attempt to reconnect to the radio station.  Now the app cuts out  multiple times and I have to re-sign in and tap the play/pause button to reconnect to the station.  I use the TuneIn Radio app whenever this app acts up.  I would use TuneIn for everything but it can not play iHeart stations.  I really like my local iHeart station, but I can't stand how often the station cuts out and the app does not make any effort to reconnect unless you manually stop and start the transmission.... TuneIn will cut out occasionally but it has always retrieves the signals within a minute.  AGAIN THIS app does not seem to care about reconnecting after the signal cuts out."

This app also has pre-made stations such as All Beatles and Stones, or music for working out.

26103,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-28,1,"IHeart Radio Too Hard to Use   It's a good concept, but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites.  Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the?  I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east?  I was hitting the choices to see what would happen.  Once I got a station on favorites (always by mistake), it was futile to remove it from the list.  Know what?  I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?!  Just more headaches.  The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who don't sit hitting buttons all day long.  Lastly, there didn't appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music.  I'm  not a  Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days.  We Boomers aren't dead yet, people!  Provide something for our age group or lose business.  Thank you."

Each time I have to restart the program, I have to listen to a commercial then the program I was listening to resumes.

Also, site info on artists is pretty handy. However, iHeart provides actual radio stations.  I wish Pandora offered the same. Excellent sound quality over WiFi on a cheap ICraig Android dongle."

I recommend your child not be left unattended while listening."

26324,"iHeartRadio",2014-04-03,3,"90 minute repeats - just like their radio stations   I was hoping for more when I finally signed up for a 'IHeartRadio' account, but after 6 hours of listening today (while repairing some equipment) I figured out that they repeat songs every 90 minutes just like all their radio stations. When you start hearing repeats you need to go reset your starting point.Considering the amount of music available to an 'online only' music service, it astounds me that they have to repeat somgs after only 90 minutes. (I thought that about broadcast radio too but got over that pretty quickly.)So I will use them occasionally but it is not the 'one place' to hear music."

26335,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-05,1,"Would not play desired station and no response for help from the developer.  Waste of download time.   I was really excited about this app and I wanted to love it, but my experience just isn't good.  I downloaded the app because it was supposed to broadcast one specific station that I really wanted.  The station advertised that it is available on this app and the app itself also advertised the station.  However, after downloading, I clicked on the station to play it and my phone just sat silent.  I tried playing other stations, all of which seemed to work fine.  But the one station that I wanted, and the only reason I downloaded the app, did not work.  My husband had the app on his phone (which is a completely different model and OS) and the result was the same.  The app just would not play the desired station.  I would have written the experience off with a few more stars because other stations did work.  However, I contacted iHeartRadio via their reporting service and described my issue.  I never heard back from them.  As a result, I give three stars for the app not working as advertised and I lowered that to just one star because of the lack of response by the developer."
26343,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-26,5,"favorite music app   It's as if they have climbed into my head and found all the great music that I didn't know I loved.  When you create a station and take the time to rate the songs (thumbs up/thumbs down) they play for you for a little while you will be rewarded with songs you feel as if you already know and love. The intuition of the algorithms is uncanny and wonderful. I am never disappointed."

I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said, the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can't receive locally.

What I was impressed by was the lack of ads that a normal radio station would have, so you're able to listen to a constant stream of music, even if you're unable to choose exactly which song comes next. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; don't give it a bad rating because you're looking for something else."

I used Pandora for quite some time, but the commercials are so jarring, and the variety is mediocre after you get about 30 songs liked. I haven't gotten to experiment very much with the iHeart alternative to that, but I'm hopeful. Also love that I can listen to radio stations anywhere in the country.

If you don't want to listen to one of the radio stations you can choose a genre and it will play the kind of music you like most and when a song is playing you can hit a thumbs up so it plays more songs like that or the thumbs down and it wont play that particular song or band. Two words.....LOVE IT!!!!!!"

Now when friends in other states tell me about this or that great radio station that they have in their listening area, I can tune-in and see what they are listening to also.

I would typically switch to a different station at 9 and continue listening (as I worked around the house) until lunch time. (Both are News/Talk stations).  My 4 kids use it on their Kindles and are all experiencing the same problem (""Daaaad...  my Kindle isn't working right..."").Several updates ago (about a month or so), it just stopped working.  When it does turn on (it's not reliable as an alarm anymore), it will play for a few minutes and then just stop playing.  I have to close the app (or stop the station) and then hit play again.  It will play for a few minutes then just stop playing again...I LOVED this when it worked.  Other than iHeartRadio and Audible, I don't really use my Kindle Fire HD.  Being able to listen to books or the radio while I do other things is important to me, but the latest version(s) just don't work.I tried another station, and it was the same, so it's not the station.  The previous version didn't do it, so I don't think it's my Kindle (besides, other radio apps and Audible all work fine).  If I switch to PC, it seems to work (no perfectly, but mostly) fine.  I'm sure it was an unintended consequence of a new feature or fixing some other problem, but THIS APP IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW.  :("

However, the transmission periodically stops for periods  ranging from a few seconds to several minutes.  I have also encountered  times when I Heart Radio has or is attempting to disconnect.

It's just like Pandora, but better. There's a short advertisement at the very beginning of choosing your station but that's it. I love the clean and modern look to the app also. I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone who doesn't really want to spend money on music."
26669,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-04,5,"Great sounds   The best radio around and if you get tired of one station you can switch to another very easy."

26685,"iHeartRadio",2014-10-15,5,"Best Radio Music App   I think this is the best radio app out there currently. I just put it on and let it roll. I like and dislike what I listen to. After awhile it sort of learns the songs I like and plays them. I leave the setting to mix so once in a while I have to vote on a new song. My music choice is rather mix, so this is perfect for listening to many music genres in one place (for free). It does required a good connection for use. Have not tested other features to buy music or set up stations, but this is my music app of choice. Pandora is a close second."

26697,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-21,5,"Love It   My son told me about the iHeartRadio app and I love it! The great thing is I can scan stations and not lose my original station. Seeing I usually listen on my phone at work I do not have the time to look and see what station I was listening to. I also like the way they set it up. Instead of hundreds of stations in one place you can search from town to town and it makes it so much nicer not to be scrolling through 100s of stations just to find a song you like. And the categories are right on the money. I search old country and I get the oldies not the 80s. LOVE it!I defiantly am recommending this to all of my friends. It is user friendly and I have never had a problem with the stream."

I opted not to go through Facebook. No problem. It remembers my favorites, etc.I got this app because Nikki Sixx has a channel on there called Sixx Sense, which is cool, but then I started to like the other aspects of it as well.  If you create a station, it learns from what you like or dont and makes your station better. Very nice."
26706,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-03,4,"Great for most things   I listen to this app more than anything else.  Only down side is some streaming radio channels like The Blaze won't play continuously.  I thought maybe it was a signal strength issue till I streamed these changes from their web site and they played without issue.  If they could stream live feeds more reliably, it would be a 5 star app for sure."

I will be listening to a song and the app will close, I will constantly reopen it and it will play for a while, then close again. It has become obnoxious after the seemingly thousandth time of this happening. It is nice if you just want music as your background and you leave the app open while your cleaning, but other than that it's upsetting.Off to try Pandora"

For some reason, every time I try to open it, it tells me ""iheartradio has stopped"", I've spent more time trying to get it to work than actually using it! Done everything tech support has told me to do, even tried uninstalling. If this is supposed to be the best radio app ever it sucks. I'm very VERY disappointed!! It got 2 stars for the sheer fact that the UI was good & easy to use and when the app worked it was great & played all my favorites. Fix the force close and you have 5 stars from me."

26799,"iHeartRadio",2014-06-09,4,"Best radio App out there.   I was a Pandora user like most of us, that was until they had a 6 song limit or whatever it was. I HEART is a good App that is  100% free and you can find just about any radio station you're looking for.  I moved to Houston about two years ago and Houston is where I reside now. The one thing I missed most was the music.  I found both of my favorite Hawaiian reggae stations on IHEARTRADIO. So I am able to keep up with the new jams comin out of Hawai'i! It's a blessing!"

The only thing I hate is that many of these stations are like on a loop recorded feed and repeat a lot of the content. If you listen for a few hours, some stations will recycle through the same playlists, and same DJ rhetoric as the previous hours or days before. It is not always live, but a good app for music overall."

I read the reviews to see what everyone else was saying first though. I didn't realize you had thlo log into facebook. Sure, I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio, but it shows what you're listening to. I'm not going to download it because I don't want my friends to know what I'm listening to. If you want my opinion, just get Pandora. It's free and all you need is an email."

27506,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-10,5,"awesome music   It has awesome music and plays all may favorite songs, but it requires internet and you have limited skips(to skip music). But except for that it's an awesome app"

27601,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-02,1,"Monopolistic.   This is a terrible application, indicative of the current state of radio.  Why do I need to download a proprietary app to listen to a radio station?  Why can't I surf to a website and stream from there?  Information.  Nobody is listening to garbage radio anymore and they need ratings information so they can sell you a new mattress.  Plus it's buggy.  Don't give in."
27606,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-03,1,"Pandora is better   Pandora is better and this seemed worthless.  I'm glad I didn't buy this because the reviews told me enough. I don't have a facebook so this would've been a complete waste."
27609,"iHeartRadio",2012-09-05,1,"Boycotting...   Clear Channel took away the longest running rock station in Atlanta and turned it into a pop station. We now have 5 pop stations and no hard rock. All those stations play the same music. The Project family will not stand for this. We will fight for our Project 9-6-1! Are you ready Clear? Its just going to get worse!"
27614,"iHeartRadio",2012-01-03,1,"Sucks   This app is ridiculous. I wanted to have it to listen to a local radio station. I have really good service, full bars PLUS a good WiFi connection, and yet its skips its way through everything. Most of the time I'm just listening to dead air, waiting for the song to come back for a only about 3 seconds before it is dead air again. Plus a lot of the time its not even playing the same thing as the radio station that I'm wanting to listen to. What's the point of trying to listen to a radio station when it won't even play what that station is playing. I think I'll just stick with Pandora."
27616,"iHeartRadio",2012-02-21,1,"This app requires Facebook. Enough said. One star until that changes.   This app requires Facebook. Enough said. One star until that changes. Why does Amazon require 20 words? I got my point across in less, sorry for the filler."

The sound on the Kindle Fire HD is simply a knock out.  Cannot believe that sound comes out of that thin piece of amazement!!!!  Truly, I recommend getting the full version of this app.  It is not much and is totally worth it.Thanks to Pandora and amazon.com."

27655,"Pandora",2016-05-26,5,"Best Music Player out there!   I love that I get to listen to whatever I want whenever I want. The music quality is as good as I want to make it. PANDORA is EXCELLENT!"
27658,"Pandora",2015-08-01,4,"nothing evil in THIS box!   Being able to pick ""stations"" for your favorite music means very little you dislike, though Pandora limits the number of pieces you can skip through, and there are ads unless you pay to avoid them."
27659,"Pandora",2017-09-27,5,"Five Stars   I Love It !!! Listen all day at work, makes the day a whole lot easier !!"
27661,"Pandora",2013-03-20,5,"The internet music standard - for good reason   This app has always made advances with internet radio and doesn't disappoint.  It's very rare that there are issues with the app or the connection (as long as you have a good WiFi connection of course).  You can set up your own channels and listen to everything from rock to classical to comedy bits.An excellent app that everyone should have, in my opinion.-D"
27663,"Pandora",2016-03-10,3,"Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like   Really wonderful that is adapts to play music that you like. The only problem is it has loading problems. It can take a long time to start the next song."

Now that I have a mini Bose blue tooth speaker it's even better.I listen tall all my favorite channels at home and now at work.I have the premium Pandora with no commercials. It's wonderful.Mozart to Joe Walsh to Muddy Water. What a way to listen to uninterpreted music all day long."
27671,"Pandora",2016-11-22,4,"Ads cost Pandora a !!!   Four stars because of advertising, would be better without ads and no charge to remove them !"
27672,"Pandora",2015-11-15,4,"Very Nice   Pandora is overall a great listening station. I mean, you can't get any better than free. Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs. And considering the fact that the same ads play all the time, it can get quite irritating. Great app though. :)"
27675,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   I love me some PANDORA would not change for anything unless it's better."

Pandora used to be good, until they added strict limits on how many songs you could skip during the whole day and shoved a commercial down your throat every other song. There's way better options out there."
27698,"Pandora",2013-12-07,5,"Great Music, more choices,   It works for me.  I love it.  I live in an apartment building and my neighbors say they hear Pandora coming from my apt. and love the music.  Some also use it.  I'm 66 years old and find it difficult to listen to my car radio.  There is less music on the car radio then ever before.  I like having choices and with Pandora you do."
27700,"Pandora",2016-07-07,5,"Awesome customizability yall   Love this app.  I know its been around for years now but I just decided to check it out.  Love customizing my own stations."
27703,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"This is a really good product.   I like this very much.  Its a little hard to figure out how to work it.  Are there any instructions?  Don't know where they are.  But the fact is once you get it started, its really terrific.  The music fits my choices exactly.  They know what I like better than I do. Very enjoyable on my Kindle Fire. Nice to make good use of really good sound on the Kindle Fire."
27707,"Pandora",2015-12-31,5,"Da BEST!!!!   This is my favorite music app everrrrr I use it all the time,  LITTERALLY.  😃 I recommend this app for anyone looking for a free,  good working,  efficient app!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

I am able to create stations and playlists of my favorite music, which allows me to simply click on my favorite Irish playlists, and hear my favorite drinking songs!  I love this app!"
27714,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"Five Stars   So far so good with setting up, selecting, and playing."
27715,"Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"short amount of time   In the short amount of time I spent on Pandora the first time, I was able to find a mess of songs and artists that I enjoy.  Now I just need the time to go back for more.  I couldn't find my favorite Christmas CD at home, but found some pleasant music to listen to on a very snowy holiday complete with a crackling fire !!!"
27719,"Pandora",2013-03-24,5,"Pandora application for Kindle   One of the main reasons for buying my Kindle Fire was so I could listen to Pandora in my house through my stereo and also out in my shop through another stereo. It works very well. It is not quite as user friendly as the one on my Macbook but I think with a little time I will learn new tricks and shortcuts. I am very happy with it overall and very grateful to get it for free."
27722,"Pandora",2017-09-11,4,"Overall   Overall - Great.  Could use a little more material.  Start to hear several repeats."
27723,"Pandora",2015-08-03,3,"Too many ads   Good music, like being able to select favorites and skip songs, but the ads are loud and annoying. I use this to play lullabies to my daughter and inevitably a commercial will come on and wake her up."
27724,"Pandora",2015-01-03,5,"Five Stars   Really happy with this app.  Add stations then shuffle, couldn't be easier to customize the music."
27726,"Pandora",2015-04-16,5,"Great app   Awesome app. Free version works great. If you don't mind the commercials every now and then, I see no reason to purchase the paid version. Great for getting to know similar or new bands that relate to bands you already know."
27728,"Pandora",2017-09-04,5,"Love it   Love the selection of music"
27732,"Pandora",2013-01-18,4,"Great site!   Great site with extended and complete information about songs and artist.Unfortunetly too much advertisment, but the service is excellent."

27735,"Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"Replaces XM radio   This service replaces my XM radio. Preferring to go ad less I have tried the 1 month free trial and will continue based on my experience so far . I have created my own stations and tuned in the stations created by genre. These have been very satisfactory. Even paying for premium service it is less than Xm."
27753,"Pandora",2013-04-22,3,"Glitchy on the Kindle Fire HD...   Love pandora as a service and use across other devices as well, but this app needs to be smoothed out for the kindle fire HD.  It often won't shut off (or become mute) when closing the cover, and it also hampers the use of other apps while running simultaneously.It's free, and I trust they'll work out the flaws eventually.  Until then it gets three stars..."
27755,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Blues Addict for life.   Love my Blues entertainment every night and playing it with my guitar."

27761,"Pandora",2016-01-24,5,"Awesome app   This app is completely useful instead of having to go on YouTube and searching for your favorite song I guarantee your favorite song will come on with Pandora"
27765,"Pandora",2014-03-19,5,"Perfect   I love Pandora as i can customize my own station.  I can also make multiple stations for those days when I want to listen to Country and the other days where I need a little spiritual music in my ear.  You can dislike and like songs as you go along to build up your playlist.  Love this app for my Kindle."

27783,"Pandora",2014-03-13,3,"Good, but unfortunate commercials   I love using pandora personally, but when I use it for a kids station, I don't like that the commercials are sometimes questionable, or strange topics for kids to overhear.  For example, on the Radio for Kids station, there is an egg donation commercial that comes on often that has spurred odd questions."
27785,"Pandora",2017-09-24,5,"Pandora rocks!   App, works well. No problems at all, two thumbs up!!"

27804,"Pandora",2013-01-17,5,"Love this app   My taste in music is pretty diverse.  Every genre of music I've searched has been able to be located on Pandora.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants music on the go."

27815,"Pandora",2016-06-26,4,"😁   I already loved this app. Only problem I have with it is when it keeps losing signal when it's sitting in the same spot."
27818,"Pandora",2014-02-03,5,"Your favorite music, whenever you want it   This app finds music to  fit my mood.  When I want Strauss waltzes, I can hear only waltzes.  When I want easy listening, that's what I get.  I choose thumbs up or down for each piece of music, and the station gives more of the type I want.  There are commercials, but they are fewer than a local radio station."

27870,"Pandora",2013-12-11,4,"A must have app!   I love Pandora and this is a very nice app. It allows you to access all of your channels and explore music intuitively. The only thing that I was not terribly fond of was the interface for creating new channels and finding music outside of your already defined channels. Otherwise it is a great app and very functional."
27872,"Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Pretty cool!   The variety is cool but it's so confusing for me. Hopefully I'll get used to it cause it seems like a really cool thing."
27874,"Pandora",2014-04-27,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Pandora!   I have Pandora on our home computer, and now to have it ""to go"" on my Kindle is just fantastic!  Love the huge selection of music I can pick from!There is absolutely NOTHING bad to say about Pandora!  Everyone should get this, start picking their music, and just ENJOY!!!"
27879,"Pandora",2017-01-14,3,"Not worth the money for me.   It's O.K., but doesn't have near the catalog of different genres as Spotify."
27884,"Pandora",2017-03-02,4,"Four Stars   Love it"
27885,"Pandora",2016-05-01,4,"My problem with Pandora is, it don't always show ...   My problem with Pandora is, it don't always show the correct song and artist that is playing. I go to sleep listening every night!"
27886,"Pandora",2013-09-18,5,"Pandora makes my day!   This is the best thing since iTunes.  I use Pandora quite a few hours a day.  I also have it on my tablet.  Everyone should join Pandora One.  The fee for a year is so good and gives you want, what is so nice is that you can also load it on your cell phone and then play on your car radio.I urge everyone to join and enjoy."
27887,"Pandora",2013-07-01,5,"Great Website!   I've used this website on my PC, and Phone and now on my Kindle. I'm now a Pandora One member. I love that it plays my favorite music and I can listen anywhere. Thank you Pandora !! I also found out that you can ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" a song and Pandora will learn what you like. How innovative. I listen to it on my Kindle and on my smart phone."
27890,"Pandora",2014-05-09,3,"Not as useful as I'd hoped it would be   This app is fast, easy to use, and intuitive. The layout is very similar to that of the iOS version on the iPhone. My only issue is that when I'm out I'm more likely to have my phone on me so I use the app on my phone. When I'm at home I'm more likely to use Pandora on my computer because it's easier. So I very rarely seem to be able to find much use for Pandora on my Kindle. Additionally, my Kindle relies on wi-fi so when I'm out if I have no wi-fi access then the app is basically useless so I go back to my phone anyway. For me, personally, this app doesn't get much use on the Kindle."
27891,"Pandora",2015-08-29,5,"great music app   Love Pandora ...listen all the time. Like that you can pick the kind of music you like and that it will play music like it...found a bunch of new groups and artists I hadnt heard before."
27894,"Pandora",2012-10-10,5,"Great Music (because you choose it yourself)   I have a very eclectic mix on my station (I subscribe to PandoraOne, but the app is a free download); you can give a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" on any song, and, if you don't like it, will probably not hear anything too much like it again.  I recently added another station for straight-ahead Latin jazz (e.g., Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin, etc.), and the stuff they include is always very good."
27898,"Pandora",2017-05-30,5,"Five Stars   I love the program they play, its wonderful the music i enjoy"

Have used it at home for quite a while, now I use it with my Fire phone and Bluetooth to a Bose wireless speaker.  Nice to have when doing my projects around the home-just pick what channel I'm in the mood for and let her play the tunes. .  . ."
27912,"Pandora",2013-10-31,4,"Pandora Review (free version)   Pandora has been around a long time so by now everyone pretty much knows what they're getting. I have been using the free version for about two years now, listening to the endless cycling of the same commercials every 2-3 songs - but hey it's free so I can't dispute it otherwise. The commercials are relatively short but it wouldn't hurt to mix them up every once in a while rather than force the listener to hear to the same Home Depot bit a dozen times within the span of two hours. I have yet to purchase Pandora One (paid version), but the thought has crossed my mind since it's only a measly $3 per month ($36/year). This version eliminates all commercials.Pros:-free-offers different stations from an array of artists where alike music is mixed in-there is enough variety if you like to frequently switch stations-easily syncs with your phone allowing for a skip or pause button-they have a decent rating system where it plays to your likes and dislikes-if you get tired of a song then there are options to shelf it for a whileCons:-commercials are repetitive and seems to have become more frequent than what they were two years ago when I first downloaded-not enough variety of songs if you keep it on one station, you hear the same tracks if you're a daily listener-rating system tends to overcompensate to your like and dislikes (e.g. if you give a thumbs up to say a country song that you're listening to, then they will force feed you with country songs thinking that's all you want to hear), but the more you rate the better it fixes itselfOverall Recommendation:If commercials bother you then one can eliminate commercials by subscribing at a monthly cost less than what it takes to put a gallon of gas in your car. I would definitely pay the $3 if there was a guarantee for better variety, but until then I'm satisfied with the free version and who knows, maybe that's why I'm shopping at Home Depot more as of late..."

We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!"

27959,"Pandora",2013-06-24,4,"Plays well, most of the time. Needs more extensive song list though.   Plays pretty well. BUt there have been several songs /artists that are far from unknown that I thought surely would be included and were not showing up at all in search! This needs improving, also on the FREE version, there seems a lot of stopping, and pausing between playing tracks. BUt hey, it is FREE so  am not really complaining. Haha!! ;o)"

I enjoy many different styles and genres of music and Pandora will play songs from all of them and mix it up any way I want them to.

That gives me exactly what I want to hear and listens to me when i tell it I don't like something and would rather not hear it again.

28035,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"I dedicate this song to myself   I much prefer the advertisements to the limited listening times that Pandora used to have. I LOVE the shuffle feature allowing multiple stations to be mixed. Only feature missing is the ability to merge similar stations."

28171,"Pandora",2013-04-07,4,"it WAS awesome...   ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWCurrent version still has a great selection and variety and almost no bugs.  You have to register via email to use it now and It now has double the ads and they come in audio AND video form, usually in pairs or threes.  Recently they removed the previously added time limit of a few hours a month.  This means that, although you are still limited to a half dozen skips a day, you can at least listen to a station or change stations for as long as you want.  This change made it regain a previously lost star and caused me to re-download it.  They also added a feature to share the song on your registered pandora profile, facebook, and twitter.  You still won't get that perfect song in one go, but you won't run out of time waiting for it to queue up. It's still 3.99 for unlimited ad free music. I can't give it the full 5 stars because of the amount of Ads (I understand they have to do so to provide music for free, but they are going overboard) and the need to email register an account with them (sketchy stuff that often leads to notif and junk spamming), but it has definitely earned at least one more star for getting rid of that time limit.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and doesn't mind sitting through less favorite songs and ads to hear their top picks (like we used to do with the radio, before lime wire and kazaa)ORIGINAL REVIEW:It has a great selection and variety, almost no bugs, and tolerable ads.  However, recently they added a time limit that is only a few hours a month!  I could see an hour a day, but if you listen as often as I do, this means you can only use the app within the first few days of a month. First week, tops.  This would make it acceptable for people who only listen for a song every now and then, but you still only get 6 skips an hour per station, so you won't get that perfect song in one go, and if you wait to hear it you'll run out of time for the month.  Of course you can buy the 3.99 app and pay for unlimited ad free music or even pay .99 when your times up to keep listening for the month, but let's face it, this app was used too much without enough revenue so they are gonna force us to pay or suffer. Meanwhile, I'll be finding a new app."

I've tried others and they all have their own little niche, and hence, they are all a bit different but this one suits my needs perfectly.  I don't want to listen to a whole album, I just want to listen to some of the tracks from my favorite artists and that's exactly what this provides.  Of course it would be fantastic to have the best of all of these types of apps together in one app but that would cost a fortune.I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of data  that this doesn't use.....of course it could be much better, but compared to others, this uses a lower amount of data.  There are a ton of visual advertisements!!!  But, I use this on my phone and I minimize it so that I don't see them.  I don't know if that helps keep the amount of data usage lower but like I said, compared to other music streaming apps this is far superior."
28204,"Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Better than Slacker, in my opinion.   I like this so much better than the Slacker app.  It just seems like Pandora is a lot better at picking music that I like instead of Slacker.  Slacker will play some raaaaaaaandom stuff!

28253,"Pandora",2012-09-05,3,"i loved this app until today's update!   the music sounds better, but there is an odd popping noise between songs. the music skips sometimes and the volume controls are all jacked up. if i control the volume via the app, it is barley audible at high volume. if i turn it up on the device and then go into the app, the app mutes. if i use device controls while IN the app, all it does is get lower, not higher. fix please!"

It also offers great kids clean versions of songs, must be supervised by an adult of course as they can see what's in their parents favorite stations as well.  The only improvement I would like to see is being able to have a kids only version so if I'm not looking they can't accidentally select something inappropriate."
28287,"Pandora",2013-04-22,5,"streams great   I love this app. it has every kind of music you can imagine so no one will be unhappy. The quality of music is great.

28315,"Pandora",2013-01-28,5,"Wow it is radio my way!   Pandora is wonderful I have it everywhere, kindle, Directtv and iPhone. They are each geared to what I want on each one according to the location I use my units.

28356,"Pandora",2013-06-22,5,"Great for Music Lovers   I love Pandora. This app is great for listening to your favorite kind of music all on one station. I use it to work out when I'm at the gym, and on my commute.Pro:-You can ""like"" the song to make sure you get to hear it again, and give the song a thumbs down to ensure the station doesn't play it again.-Limited commercial interruptions-Free!Cons:-Can only skip a limited number of songs-When I'm in the car it has to run on 3G which uses a lot of data"

28365,"Pandora",2012-12-27,4,"Pandora Media   I think this is a fabulous way to listen to music.  Love the radio station choices geared to one;s personal preferences as well as the cross references that lead from one liked singer or group to a similar one.  The only criticism I have is that the search mechanism does not include song titles.  It is necessary to know who recorded the song to find it."
28366,"Pandora",2016-07-10,3,"I love this App   I love this App. I just don't like the constant reminder that I am not logged in to iTunes."
28370,"Pandora",2012-12-31,4,"it's like listening to a radio but better   I have a kindle fire hd and I love listening to music. This app worked great I didn't have a problem with it at all . It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app ."
28371,"Pandora",2015-06-30,4,"pretty good app   I really love this app it very awesome but I gave it 4 stars because you get lots of adds and only get like 15 skip the song things in a day otherwise  it is the best music app"
28372,"Pandora",2015-03-28,1,"No longer Free   Pandora doesn't allow free music anymore. You either have to pay for the update and continue paying for months or you have to go on the website to listen. The app is no longer free. Waste of time."
28382,"Pandora",2014-11-26,4,"Good stuff.   I really enjoy this app.  The commercials are annoying, but if I wasn't so cheap and I actually paid for Pandora, I wouldn't have any commercials to begin with. Luckily the commercials are a good distance apart. The end."

28403,"Pandora",2013-06-07,4,"Best music app   Pandora is the best music app out there. Easy to understand and plays great songs. The one bad part is they limit ur free listening to 40 hours a month. After that you either pay .99 for the rest of the add supported month or buy the non add supported unlimited listening. I listen at work all day so my time is up in a week."
28404,"Pandora",2015-09-08,5,"Great music!   Pandora is so convenient.  I can't wait to hear what song is coming up next.  I have the choice of thumbs up or down which I love.And it's free.Jan"

28409,"Pandora",2015-05-25,2,"it ok   Pandora was good at one point, now every other song leads to 3 commercials and disliking a song takes 5 minutes to load, the computer version is slightly better and is way last buggy"
28412,"Pandora",2012-10-15,5,"Pandora   Love being able to pinpoint the kind of music I want to listen to.Love being able to vote down music that I don't like andthumbs up to music I especially enjoy so the station willseek more of the same.Like being able to choose different venues to suit my mood.one of my most favorite and freqently used ap on my Kindle Fire"
28419,"Pandora",2015-03-19,1,"supports Monsanto   Pandora was perfect in every way until I heard a Monsanto advertisement. I am completely against Monsanto (nothing good comes from that ugly company), I deleted Pandora. Highly disappointed. Booo."
28421,"Pandora",2013-04-28,5,"Perfect for work   We don't have music at work, so I took my tablet in this week, downloaded Pandora and started enjoying my days.  Time goes by so much quicker when you have music you enjoy listening to.  I get to decide if today will be pop, soft rock or country, or just music similar to some of my favorites.  I really enjoy picking the all 80's or all 90's stations and easing through my day with great music.  Pandora is SUPER and I am glad it is out there for me to enjoy.  And I am just now learning how extensive this media is and I look forward to hearing it ALL!"
28422,"Pandora",2014-12-10,5,"I really like it, right now I am just in one ...   I am very appreciative of this app. I recently discovered it and I am wondering why I was not informed about this app. I really like it, right now I am just in one artist, but I am enjoying it.THANK YOU  !!!!!"
28425,"Pandora",2017-01-02,5,"Five Stars   Love being able to just listen to the music I like."
28432,"Pandora",2013-12-21,5,"Never thought it would be this good!   I've been an occasional listener to Pandora. I was recently talking to a friend about her music playing in the background since it was one well placed song after another. She told me it was Pandora and how ridiculously inexpensive it is, $36 a year! I signed up, noticed the advertising gone, but more, since I had put some cash on the line, I wanted to check out my purchase. I have been stunned at the well coordinated genres of music that has been combined on My Own radio station. How do you go so seamlessly from Dixie Chicks, through Norah Jones and Steve Winwood, to Journey, with perfect song selection from each?! Really invigorating! I'm hooked!! Thank you Pandora! What a concept so well fulfilled!"
28438,"Pandora",2016-09-05,5,"Best music ever!   I absolutely love having all the different artists available to me at once."

28512,"Pandora",2016-09-17,5,"Five Stars   Better than FM and does not charge a monthly fee like satellite radio."
28515,"Pandora",2013-01-28,5,"Love Pandora!   Use Pandora all the time.Considering getting the paid version, less/no advertising.Even though I could get my satellite radio providers service, Pandora is better because you can control what you want to listen to vs having to listen to what is being broadcast at the time.

28532,"Pandora",2013-10-20,5,"I like being able to pick and choose my music this site give me that choice.   Five stars easy, the music and other programs offered on Pandora are what I enjoy listening too. Also they don't have signal drop and now I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am able to move around and listen before I select the programing I want. AOL radio doesn't work more than half the time and I have gotten an on screen message several times saying to try again later, when I do, still nothing. Pandora  is good listening and I really don't mind the comms that are a part of the free programing either.Bill"

28542,"Pandora",2013-05-06,1,"Pandora -- not user friendly   I downloaded and installed Pandora on my Kindle Fire. I created a station and everything seemed to work fine. However when I walked away and returned, the station was no longer functioning. Turns out that the ap requires you to interact with it from time to time or it shuts down the station. This stinks! I switched to another streamer that does not require me to be glued to my screen. Pandora better fix this or they will quickly be OBE."

28613,"Pandora",2014-04-15,5,"It's all there for the asking...   At first, I thought Pandora was okay, pretty good music, infrequent, brief commercials, and free.  Then I started to work on it, adding artists until I have the most amazingly eclectic mix of country rock, blues, jazz, Grateful Dead, Beach Boys, and it's still free. Only thing, once in a while, I'll get some schwilly Christmas song dropped in - yo9u have to be sure to exercise the thumbs down if you don't like something.  For me, Pandora is just the best!"

29133,"Pandora",2016-01-30,4,"Love the music, but wish the ads were softer   I love being able to play music at night while rocking the baby, but I hate that the volume of the ads are so much louder than the music that it wakes him up. The selection and variety of music though is really nice and I suppose I could pay and have those annoying ads removed, but the ads themselves really dont bother me.  Just how loud they are.  I read one time that increased volume on ads supposedly increases their effectiveness which is why television ads are required to fall within a certain volume level.Perhaps it is more jarringly noticeable because I am playing soft lullabies.  That is my only complaint though and use this free app a lot without it freezing or having bugs."

29184,"Pandora",2013-12-07,4,"okay   I love how it plays great songs after songs but one thing I don't like is you only have a limited amount of songs you can dislike until it plays it and gives you the notice you have disliked to many songs.

I am 80 years old, retired 21 years,and watching my expenses.Sirius offered a half-price deal for six months, which I accepted. When that expired, I cancelled again.When I received a free subscription to Pandora, I accepted.  Pandora offers a wide variety of music selections to suit almost anyone's desires.Pandora also offers a premium version with no commercial advertising for about &4 per month which is about the same as Sirius offers for a 6 month contract.I feel that I am receiving better music choices at a lower cost,since I have the free version, but would still prefer Pandora even if I chose to pay for their premium service"

30218,"Pandora",2016-10-06,1,"One Star   Did not buy this product"
30221,"Pandora",2016-09-09,4,"Four Stars   So fun to listen to the music."
30223,"Pandora",2016-02-04,4,"Good, but limited to the west   Commercials of course get annoying, but so far only play after every 3-4 songs. Also, it seems their main focus is Western music, not much research by the musicologists, or whatever they may be properly called, on music overseas. They may have stuff on J or K-pop, haven't and do not plan to check that out, but was wanting more classical, slow music in different language and it did not locate the artist by name or give me options of anything similar."
30225,"Pandora",2013-05-03,5,"Best free music app   Pandora allows you lots of flexibility to create multiple stations with specified artists. Don't like a song... just skip to the next. I can listen to Contemporary Christian, love songs, or seasonal music or even shuffle between stations I have customized. Great functionality!"
30228,"Pandora",2016-09-26,4,"Four Stars   Really enjoyed the variety"
30229,"Pandora",2016-10-22,4,"Its cool ,only critique is it locks up alot ,and while I understand the need for comercials,why the same car adds?   Ok but locks up alot"
30230,"Pandora",2013-01-23,3,"It's free but has some annoying features   Advertising is necesary to pay the costs of the service but in Pandora's case, it is invasive and annoying.When creating a latin radio station, I gave several options of musicians but Pandora kept playing the same cheap mexican american music.Not really impressed with the product."
30239,"Pandora",2016-02-24,4,"more hints   I do like this game, just wish they would give more hints after each level"
30245,"Pandora",2017-03-11,4,"Good, could be great   Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"
30249,"Pandora",2014-09-20,4,"Very interesting experiment.   Hard to argue the quality of what this site offers for free.  It does seem to progressively stray away from the channel you set up, but I guess that's kind of part of what it's about."

30271,"Pandora",2014-03-22,4,"Love Pandora.   The app is easy to use and has a good layout.  The only thing I didn't like was how close together the rating and skip buttons are to each other.  It was too easy to tap the wrong button.  Everything else worked great."
30292,"Pandora",2016-12-03,5,"Five Stars   Fantastic"
30294,"Pandora",2012-12-05,4,"Love this app.   i would love it better if i could replay a song. The app itself runs great and I enjoy how the lyrics are provided for most songs. I have two friends who have paid for the app and they say its buggy and doesn't do what it claims to do so I""m hesitate to pay for it. A trial period would be nice."
30295,"Pandora",2015-01-02,5,"It is easy to use   Pandora is my ""go to"" choice when wanting music.  It is easy to use, the choices are very good and I can't imagine not having it available when I travel."

Country, rap, classical, pop, rock, metal, and more all in an eclectic mix which fits my personality:):):) Did I mention that I even get Weird Al on my station? LOL"
30393,"Pandora",2016-08-10,5,"Thank you   I'm glad I have this! No problems."
30395,"Pandora",2014-04-07,5,"Is this for real?!   Okay, so I'm late in this whole online streaming thing in my 40's, But I was highly impressed with Pandora. Within the first 15 minutes, this app had somehow determined what type of musing I like and what other artists I might enjoy.  I was hooked instantly.  When they say you never hear a song you DON'T LIKE, they mean it. The more you rate, the more tailored your listening experience becomes. I LOVE/LIVE music......this app meets my standards! Love it."
30396,"Pandora",2014-03-29,1,"get rid of the commercials   The commercials suck...I want to hear music...also directions for creating a station from songs is very unclear...I'm going back to iHeart"

30403,"Pandora",2014-08-07,5,"GREAT APP   This is a wonderful app if you are a music lover such as myself. All you have to do is pick an artist or genre of music you like and it will play music for you that you will like for hours."
30404,"Pandora",2013-10-08,5,"Best App I Have   Since starting to use Pandora, my listening has broadened so much.  Rusted Root, Hayley Westernra, Fun....not on my radar before Pandora.  Reminds me of the Napster days...people can share their musical interests and help other listeners.  Great."
30409,"Pandora",2015-06-19,1,"NOPE NOPE NOPE   Horrible app. Cant search for just any song. Seems to always play crappy music. I un installed about an hour after installing."
30413,"Pandora",2013-09-03,5,"Pandora At Top Of Its Game   Pandora is a great free internet streaming radio service. Type in the name of a song, band, or even genre and Pandora will pay your favorites in and around that category. Free service has some ads, not as annoying as other free music streaming services"

30434,"Pandora",2016-01-29,2,"Not Great!   Not the greatest.  Sometimes it plays songs that have nothing to do with any of the songs/artists that I have ""thumbed up"".  In fact, it does that a lot.  The one thing that I like about it is I can have it playing in the background when I am using other apps on my Kindle."
30435,"Pandora",2016-06-05,5,"Loveblove love   Love the music stations and the choices you get!"
30437,"Pandora",2014-04-14,4,"Suprisingly Amazing   Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you're looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."
30438,"Pandora",2014-07-14,5,"Love   Its free music who wouldn't love it! One request though is there any way you can make it to where you have an option of listening to just the person you want instead of having many other bands."
30439,"Pandora",2016-03-06,5,"Five Stars   Love this app for my music selections. Better than others out there!"
30440,"Pandora",2016-02-16,5,"Create your own virtual radio station   Pandora is a great app if you like to play music based on your mood or your environment.  You can create multiple 'stations' that play what you want to hear by selecting a few artists or songs that you like, then the app will choose other songs that fit that style.  They have spent a tremendous amount of time categorizing and analyzing every song that plays, noting the rhythm, chord structure, key, tempo, harmonics, instrumentation, etc.  By analyzing the songs you pick, it can then go to its library and find songs that match similar features.I don't believe it will play every song on a given album/CD though.  There must be certain tracks that the record label allows them to play.  To hear the rest, you have to buy the album of course.  ;-)"
30442,"Pandora",2016-11-29,5,"Five Stars   One of my favorite apps"

Pandora puts a smile on my face and keeps it there all day, as I play music while I work.  There is no substitute that I'm aware of -- Pandora is fantastic."

30691,"Pandora",2014-05-23,2,"Too many commercials   This ""version"" plays way too many commercials.  Not a fan of it.  I have it on my ""smart TV"" and there are no commercials or very few.....  Not here.  There are tons of commercials."

30703,"Pandora",2014-05-27,3,"Not bad, not great.   Pandora seems like a nice radio station website, operable and clean. Thing is, it tends to assume about the music you enjoy and I'd say it's a 50/50 shot it'll be right. Can sometimes be annoying."
30706,"Pandora",2016-09-10,5,"Five Stars   I enjoy it very much"
30709,"Pandora",2016-01-21,2,"Two Stars   So many ads even when you upgrade. Song suggestions gets so repetitious."
30710,"Pandora",2013-01-08,5,"Couldn't live without it!   Couldn't make it through the day without Pandora! I log in to Pandora One which is commercial free and can't say I have any complaints about it!

30730,"Pandora",2014-03-11,5,"love Pandora   easy to install and Pandora offers wonderful music that you select according to your own taste.  Would have purchased if it weren't free.  Have this app on kindle and blu ray player and they work just the same."

30734,"Pandora",2015-04-16,5,"fun, easy   fun, easy, free, great music suggestions.  I cant imagine there is something new to say about this that hasn't already been said...."

30758,"Pandora",2016-07-18,4,"Four Stars   Great. To bad no rewind button."
30763,"Pandora",2015-09-10,3,"HALF and half   It's okay but it sucks that you can't look up i.e. specific song.. Only ones they consider 'similar'"
30764,"Pandora",2014-04-11,5,"great   songs not liked are played in full instead of being skipped alll together which makes you listen to a song you do not want on your playlist all the way through before moving on to the next one on shuffle"
30769,"Pandora",2015-06-28,5,"Five Stars   Excellent I use it every day! I listen to my favorite music at least three times a day. The selections always great."
30777,"Pandora",2012-12-19,4,"Music with a bang.   I chose this radio because of its great diversity in music choice. Ive only used it a few times, but the artists available are aplenty.I do question wether or not one has to rate each song like other online  radios, for the music to continue its playing. That gets a bit tedious."
30802,"Pandora",2015-10-31,5,"Always great.   Can't complain. App works great. Ads are low and non instrusive. Will always keep using."
30804,"Pandora",2016-09-17,5,"Five Stars   I love the music"
30811,"Pandora",2014-03-27,5,"Great app1   Great music selections! I've been letting Pandora do the choosing rather than create my own playlists and it's been fine. The commercials are mildly intrusive, but can't complain since it's a free service."
30821,"Pandora",2016-09-21,5,"Five Stars   Great listening"
30824,"Pandora",2014-04-21,5,"Love Pandora   I use my Pandora App all the time. I can change the stations, shuffle them around for a different mix. It is very easy to use and I can set the tone for what I am doing with the music that is playing."
30832,"Pandora",2016-01-31,5,"Five Stars   Wonderful asset when listened to over my Bluetooth Bose FM receiver"
30841,"Pandora",2015-09-26,5,"Five Stars   Love Pandora. Like a station inside my head that picks music my soul is searching for, amazing!"
30843,"Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"Very nice!   Great for listening to some of your favorite music.  The ads do play in between songs if you are listening for awhile but it is still worth it.  Lyrics are included, too, most of the time, and also a bio on the musician."
30846,"Pandora",2016-02-02,4,"Four Stars   Would be nice if I could keep some favorites to play back anytime."
30847,"Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Four Stars   Like most of the music played"
30849,"Pandora",2015-10-22,3,"of course if I had a paid subscription it might be better.   It's ok, too many intruptions, of course if I had a paid subscription it might be better."
30851,"Pandora",2015-04-23,5,"Satisfied   I love listening to Pandora!  It plays the kind of music I want to hear, when I want to hear it with no commercial interruptions!"
30857,"Pandora",2014-06-02,5,"Totally my music!   I think that Pandora is totally the best!!! Really hands down I can take anywhere and enjoy the music I enjoy, not what someone else has programmed! Best ever ,I am totally sold on Pandora :)"

30863,"Pandora",2013-02-07,5,"Best Stress Reducer Ever   I love Pandora Radio!! I can play music to suit my mood or even change my mood.  If I need a lift or need to calm down, I can change the music to suit me.  I've discovered new music that I love and rediscovered music of my youth.  I can't say enough good things about Pandora"
30864,"Pandora",2015-07-21,4,"Great except when I select an artist   Great except when I select an artist, it doesn't give me just that particular artist.  I still like it a lot."
30865,"Pandora",2016-01-22,5,"BEST APP EVER!!!!   Awesome, it's the best thing I have seen. I would choose it over TV!"
30868,"Pandora",2015-11-18,4,"See Songs in Other Apps and Stations in Shuffle   I love Pandora, and I probably listen to it at least 6 hours a day. However, there are 2 problems with the app that I have.First of all, the app used to display the song and artist as well as a pause button in the drop down tool bar on the Kindle Fire. It would be nice to have that back. This way I don't need to be in Pandora to see what song or artist it is.Second, when the stations are on shuffle, it doesn't say which station the song currently playing is coming from. This is a problem because I can't like or dislike songs for fear of them being on the wrong station.Other than thos  two complaints,the Pandora app is awesome!"
30873,"Pandora",2013-07-21,5,"Love it!   This is awesome! It was recommended by a friend. He always has me listen to new artists and I asked how he found that he liked them and he said Pandora. Apparently it will play artists comparable to the artists you choose to listen to. Great radio!"
30875,"Pandora",2016-10-11,5,"Good music   Excellent"
30888,"Pandora",2015-03-15,5,"VERY IMPRESSIVE   The variety of music is outstanding - I don't even mind the advertising - if you listen to regular radio, they too have commercials !!!"
30889,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Five Stars   Love the music"
30890,"Pandora",2016-05-31,5,"OUTSTANDING PANDORA   OUTSTANDING!!! Love all the choices !!!"
30891,"Pandora",2015-06-17,5,"Five Stars   love my Pandora"
30897,"Pandora",2016-06-13,4,"Four Stars   it is really good music to listen to"
30898,"Pandora",2012-06-27,3,"missing some features   its nice, but not as nice as the PC version. you can't view lyrics on the app, and the ads are completely too much. the functionality to do other things is nice though. I'm listening as I type now. and you can get to it in the notices button on the KF just like if you were playing music out of your library."
30900,"Pandora",2015-11-04,5,"... fan of Pandora for years it still is my favorite of all the music apps   I have been a fan of Pandora for years it still is my favorite of all the music apps."
30902,"Pandora",2015-12-28,5,"good app   It is a good music app but you are limited to how many times you can skip"
30907,"Pandora",2014-01-08,3,"Audio levels vary and pretty standard song choice   My beef with internet radio stations is variable audio levels. iHeart, Hardradio.com or Pandora....they all have audio that will vary a lot.Other than that...Pandora's ok - kind of standard - does the job."
30908,"Pandora",2014-12-01,4,"Not to bad.:-)   Honestly it's a good app for music. But...... it does have its flaws. It might stop or daddy forward to another song. But other than that  it's awesome!!!"
30912,"Pandora",2016-05-24,5,"Five Stars   Great access to various genres of music!"
30913,"Pandora",2013-02-13,5,"Great station   Really like listening to it. I inadvertently hit the dislike button on a song that I really love and now I dont know how to request it back on there or undo what I did. I was trying to get my volume bar up and hit dislike by mistake!!! Especially love it at Christmas time."
30920,"Pandora",2015-04-05,5,"Five Stars   Best ever, its like having a private DJ, amazing continuous  music!1 you honestly couldn't pick them yourself this well....luv it!"
30922,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"Five Stars   I love it, easy to use, and I can listen to what I want to hear."
30923,"Pandora",2013-10-15,2,"something is not right   I have had to delete and redownload this app multiple times and it is still not quite working properly. I get to enjoy maybe a few songs before it won't work again."
30925,"Pandora",2013-07-02,4,"Music That Can Travel with Internet   I liked this app although when listening to the songs, the ending of the songs got cut off for some reason. I don't mind it that much that you need the internet to access it, and Pandora has expanded a lot although it could expand to greater heights."
30927,"Pandora",2016-10-07,5,"Five Stars   Great app"
30929,"Pandora",2015-12-03,1,"Pandora receives no stars   Actually, no stars, pandora would not let me register. went to iheart instead."
30932,"Pandora",2014-01-05,5,"Pandora, what's in the box? EVERYTHING!!!   I can get pretty much whatever  kind of music I want, and I like alot of foreign and exotic types along with classical,  all kinds of jazz, blues, oldies, I can go on and on. All in all I'm very pleased with Pandora!!"
30933,"Pandora",2016-03-10,5,"Still the best   Pandora has always been my favorite music streaming app."
30934,"Pandora",2013-01-08,4,"would like fewer other performers in the station   Example: I just created a Les Miserable station. Now I'm having to listen to unrelated music because it morphed into including non Les Miz music. I understand the need to incorporate other titles, but those other titles then bring in other unrelated music to the original topic."
30941,"Pandora",2015-02-27,5,"awesome   This app is awesome it has the newest and oldest music and the always play great songs the on my thing wrong with it is the advertisement"
30942,"Pandora",2014-01-26,5,"totally worth downloading best app for music comedy all kinds of ethnic songs   no reason to pay for a subscription to Sirius or XM since this can be used through bluetooth in your car or plug your phone into your stereo. There are so many different stations just make up what you want to hear"
30947,"Pandora",2016-10-14,5,"Five Stars   Awesome"
30949,"Pandora",2016-09-13,5,"Five Stars   Really like it"
30950,"Pandora",2015-07-04,4,"awesome   The only thing that would be better is if there were no commercials and free! Alan Jackson radio, highly rated!"
30951,"Pandora",2016-05-17,5,"Love it   Love it and it works great on my fire hd7"
30954,"Pandora",2015-11-04,3,"Spotify is better but this is ok.   Its a good app but with spotify now, there is no real reason to use this ever again."
30957,"Pandora",2016-09-22,4,"Ads   Too many ads"
30958,"Pandora",2016-07-17,5,"Five Stars   Love Pandora!!! Great APP!!"
30959,"Pandora",2013-05-12,1,"this is a piece of crap   I couldn't even get into it because it wouldn't let me in then I double checked my password and user name and it was correct and then I got on my computer and typed it in and it was perfectly fine."
30961,"Pandora",2016-06-29,5,"Five Stars   It's nice to have a dance party"
30966,"Pandora",2014-02-20,2,"sorry   I really like Pandora, but not sure if its Pandora or my Kindle, but the song will start to play then stop and then start again.  There is a pause in the middle of the song, it reminds me of my CD's skipping."
30968,"Pandora",2014-09-06,2,"It got ruined   I was litsening to the music and all the sudden it stopped! IT SAID I NEEDEE TO BUY A F***ING FULL VERSION TO CONTINUE! Don't waste your time on this and get Iheartradio!"

30976,"Pandora",2015-04-20,3,"ok   It's ok the only thing is if you want commercial free music you'll have to pay a subscription $4.99 for no commercials a month"
30977,"Pandora",2014-01-18,5,"pandora review.   i like being able to think out loud about my favorite music of all types.  I would like it to play as I go elsewhere on the computer.I wish you included opera.  I like full recordings of classical music"
30978,"Pandora",2014-01-01,5,"It's Pandora   This service rocks, and it is free. Sure, you get some commercials here and there but it's free. If that drives you crazy it is cheap to get them removed. I have tried other music apps and always come back to Pandora."

30984,"Pandora",2016-03-06,5,"Five Stars   I love Pandora. It's playing in my kitchen all the time."

30996,"Pandora",2013-11-08,3,"Could be improved but nice variety   I use it for my business and the volume levels are very erratic making it hard to keep a constant volume in my establisment."
30998,"Pandora",2013-05-01,5,"All the music I want, ONLY the music I want, any time!   I've loved Pandora for a long time - I will never lose my music because it has it's own web site, so when I had to replace my computer, I had immediate access to Pandora. Then I got a Kindle for Christmas ... and Pandora is just a click away. It's delightful."
31001,"Pandora",2013-12-18,5,"Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD   This is a must have app on any device whether it is via cellular device, kindle, ipad,tablet, pc or laptop. The music is free and nonstop listening on the go even. The best internet Radio there is! I absolutely love it!"
31005,"Pandora",2014-03-09,5,"i love this app!   This is a by far the best app that I have on my kindle. I listen to the Pandora app every day! I had Pandora on my computer but I can now have it wherever I go! Love the music's that I have on my station."

31026,"Pandora",2016-05-11,5,"Five Stars   The music is great. Excellent selections."
31027,"Pandora",2016-09-29,5,"Great app for a music afficionado.   Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that."
31031,"Pandora",2014-07-31,5,"MichelleHusseinsPandoraRules!!!!!!   The best thing that has ever happened to me I can't thank you enough , without pandora I would have literally nobody or nothing it's my best friend and my upper when I'm down:)"

31081,"Pandora",2013-11-14,2,"Sticking to Slacker Radio   I kept getting error messages when attempting to login.  I never was able to log in after several attempts, it still kept saying the site was unavailable."
31084,"Pandora",2014-02-16,3,"okay   This app is okay but I don't like how you have no idea what song is going to be played next. I think that Pandora should only have the songs from an artist on their station and that's it, no random singers."
31086,"Pandora",2016-07-19,5,"Great!   So far I really like it."
31090,"Pandora",2016-10-23,1,"more music   Ok"

31110,"Pandora",2014-05-19,4,"What you want when you want it.   Pandora radio customizes the radio to suit individual taste. Occasionally an ad is aired to interrupt listening pleasure, but it is tolerable after hearing the artists and songs preferred."
31122,"Pandora",2014-07-30,4,"can't search songs   I love it. It's just that you can't search songs. Why not? Can't you search songs and in that station other songs like that will come up too? I just think it would be easier."
31124,"Pandora",2015-10-23,5,"Music My Way....   This is a great app that serves the purpose of playing my favorite artist stations."

31155,"Pandora",2014-01-10,4,"Enjoy but...   It's great but it gets a bit frustrating when you'd have a specific channel ( eg James Taylor) and they play Michael Buble! If not strictly Taylor than play his contemporaries like Carol King, Jackson Brown etc,"
31160,"Pandora",2013-08-09,5,"Very good   I have really enjoyed listening to pandora.  I was surprised to have the music stop and when I checked to see if there was a problem, I checked the screen to see the question asking if I was still listening.  I'm new to all of these apps."

31213,"Pandora",2014-04-18,5,"What Can I Sat???   Headline says it all. Couldn't be better for a Free App.  Somewhat repetitious but I suppose that's why it is Free!"

31217,"Pandora",2013-08-08,5,"Very good radio app   When I get tired of hearing my MP3 music, I turn on Pandora. It is a great radio app. It is a nice change of pace from the same old music I always hear, and I might just find a song that I ""Just Have To Have....."" for my library."

31272,"Pandora",2014-10-08,4,"My go to app when I'm tired of my own playlist.   I've had a Pandora account from the beginning of time. It does a good job sticking to the genre you've picked but every now and then a random song sneaks in."

31316,"Pandora",2013-06-20,5,"Great App   I like Pandora in most of it's varying forms across platforms. but this particular format is quite nice. I enjoy having quick access to lyrics and an easy ""thumbs up/down"" function. The sound quality on my Kindle Fire HD is pretty good too."
31319,"Pandora",2014-08-03,3,"Great site and understand the limited skips and also understand ...   Great site and understand the limited skips and also understand the need to generate revenue through advertising but it is so intrusive , it makes you tune the site off."
31333,"Pandora",2016-09-11,4,"Recommend   Love Pandora.... It is great to get the monthly membership so you can play songs for four hours uninterrupted.  Only drawback to Pandora, is sometimes they get kinda wild and toss in songs that are NOT compatible with the list you have made... Like Bee Gees in with Van Morrison.  But that is only sometimes, and normally it runs smoothly!!!"
31335,"Pandora",2014-01-28,5,"Awesome   This is awesome, to be able to hear the music you like anytime, and almost anywhere.  I truly like this and recommend everyone to sign in.  Thank you Pandora owner for making this product available to us."

31340,"Pandora",2017-04-28,4,"I hope to have time very soon to enjoy all that Pandora will provide   Unfortunately not a lot of time to just sit and listen as of yet.  Company from out of state arrived so that meant trips that took me away from totally listening to music and actually getting all of my likes and dislikes registered.  I hope to have time very soon to enjoy all that Pandora will provide.  Had just enough time to know I will really enjoy it and I am really looking forward to having more listening time now that company has departed.  I am sorry to not really being ready to give a comprehensive review yet."

31369,"Pandora",2016-06-27,1,"One Star   didn't work on my fire."
31374,"Pandora",2014-01-05,5,"love it   Honestly the only downside to this is that sometimes....you just want to listen to music from the artist you chose. At least I do. However, I normally enjoy the music that's being played anyway. So no biggy."
31375,"Pandora",2014-04-29,5,"So glad to have found this   I am a senior citizen and did not know what Pandora was all about.  I was introduced by young relatives and am very impressed.  Now I can listen to the music of my youth.  Thanks to all."

31421,"Pandora",2016-05-12,5,"Beautiful music at your finger tips   I love beautiful Music. I find all of this on Pandora. I can choose the type of music I like, choose all my favorite artists and listen to Pandora all day.If you have not tried Pandora I strongly suggest that you give it a try. The holiday music and or Hymns are beautiful as well. You will not regret it one bit. Just give it a try. You will find that it will be one of the best things you can do."
31422,"Pandora",2016-07-20,5,"Music....   Music...music...."

31424,"Pandora",2016-05-10,4,"Pandora is great!   Good variety of stations to hear."
31427,"Pandora",2015-05-31,5,"Variety music   Great station. Love the variety which is good for work environment as well as relaxing at home. Keep adding."
31433,"Pandora",2014-03-29,2,"If I'd wanted endless commercials I would have just listened to the am radio!   Kids stuff all puffed up like a personal juke box kind of software which it might be if you continue to pay or whatever else you have to do. What it is NOT is a pleasant listening experience."
31434,"Pandora",2015-09-25,5,"Five Stars   I really enjoy having this. It's so nice to be able to listen to all music I llike."
31437,"Pandora",2016-08-10,5,"Five Stars   Love pandora"

31450,"Pandora",2013-10-17,5,"Love Pandora   I love that I get music that I like that I can tailor to the situation.  They also have some great picks that I had not heard of.  Great music and perfect for reading, sewing or any other activity that you have going on."
31454,"Pandora",2014-01-03,5,"It's Pandora...   I've been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
31458,"Pandora",2013-04-05,3,"I definitively like iheart much better.   Great music,but it has a very generic feel to it. I feel iheart has more features I like.The only reason I have Pandora is because iheart crashed on me and I couldn't get it up back and running."
31459,"Pandora",2016-06-21,5,"Good Stuff!!   Met all expectations!!!"
31461,"Pandora",2016-02-27,5,"First and (still) the Best   I love Pandora and I'm fiercely loyal to the service. Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe (didn't know about they offered a subscription service). The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent (some don't even have bios yet) or established artists you've never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - don't know, don't care. It's Pandora for me."
31463,"Pandora",2014-01-14,5,"Pandora is the junk   Great alternative 2 radio and a great variety of music, and especially the ability 2 customize your stations. Been listening 4 years and I still use Pandora all the time on countless devices. Top notch!!!"

31474,"Pandora",2015-01-02,4,"Good deal for the money   Works very well, only wish my Playstation 3 had app for it.  We pay the 36 dollars a year. Good variety of music and plenty of good mix."
31478,"Pandora",2015-11-24,5,"Wish I knew about this before.  My massage therapist told me about Pandora.  Love love my tunes   Love that I can pick my favorite tunes. And any kind of music I like."
31480,"Pandora",2013-09-09,5,"A Complaint   I had this app before,about 5 to 6 months ago,but now it won't work. I open the app and it just puts me at the loading screen and nothing else,I waited about 10 minutes and it didn't work. Please fix this,thanks for listening."
31483,"Pandora",2016-05-23,5,"Great mix of music available.   Love this app. Easy to set up"

31574,"Pandora",2015-03-29,5,"An amzing app   If you like music and relaxing this is 4 u, it just throws your day down the toilet squirts new ones back up😊😀😀😀🗽"
31576,"Pandora",2013-05-26,4,"nice to listen to!   I love pandora, and personally, the ads don't bother me (I  mean, I'm not going to pay to get rid of them, so it works for me). I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!"
31580,"Pandora",2016-01-30,5,"Pandora   It's the best! All my friends already know about it."
31583,"Pandora",2016-09-10,5,"K   Ok"
31591,"Pandora",2013-03-16,4,"Wonderful site   Wonder resource for finding music similar to your tastes!My only reservation is - at this relatively early date of my use-I have occasional  problems finding certain sites in the app."
31595,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Love the music"
31598,"Pandora",2014-01-14,5,"Great eRadio music   Great way to listen to music without having to search for the music you want to hear.  Select your genre or favorite artist and Pandora does the rest including new artists or others with similar music."
31602,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"OMG FUN!   Pandora provides a wide variety of music selections at no cost!  How could this not be a perfect combination???  I love the ability to funnel my listening into one artist's or genre's collections."
31603,"Pandora",2015-10-07,5,"Five Stars   I love being able to listen to music from my computer.  Pandora is wonderful!"
31605,"Pandora",2015-07-30,4,"good at home   Must be on-line to use.  Fine at home but would like to save and play when traveling by car."
31608,"Pandora",2013-03-14,4,"Pretty good   Sometimes it seems a little limited on what they play and I would like to be able to ""thumbs down"" more of the ones I don;t really want to listen to, but otherwise, pretty good station, m"
31609,"Pandora",2013-04-22,5,"Music Rocks   I love this app.  It is easy to use and lets you choose what ""channel"" you like listening to. It wlll give you a variety of different ""Like"" songs to the type you requsted.  I don't like that you can only skip 6 songs in an hour and it MAKES you listen to those you don't like.  I think you should have th option to skip if its not your fave...waste of good listening time and money ifyou have purchased Pandora for the ""no commercials"" aspect, which I have.  Also, I listen to it at work and if you don't ""Like"" or ""Dislike"" evey once in awhile it will pause your station and make you answer ""ARE YOU THERE, WE PAY FOR OUR MUSIC SO WE DON'T LIKE PLAYING TO AN EMPTY ROOM""  what the ????I mean really?  They pay?  No we pay and to pause our music just to get us to stop our WORK to answer inorder to listen kind of buggs me.  But again the music is good and I do like the app."
31616,"Pandora",2016-02-05,5,"Five Stars   Great selections, sounds, and great format. Enjoy."
31617,"Pandora",2016-07-21,5,"Pandora rocks!   Love it!!!!!!"

31661,"Pandora",2014-02-07,1,"Yuck   This was a reasonable purchase. The product did not performed as described even if the price was adequate. I don't recommend the purchase. Pandora forces you to listen to music you don't to hear."

31673,"Pandora",2015-11-28,4,"Four Stars   Works well. I will have to man up and pay to get rid of the ads."
31674,"Pandora",2013-02-03,5,"Love it for my Kindle Fire HD   I Love Pandora! I like that I can choose a genre or just an artist and it picks other artists to add to the station.  Maybe the best feature is the voting, because it allows you to customize your station. Lots more I haven't even dug into yet. Favorite app!"

32245,"Pandora",2014-07-05,4,"The Pleasure Of Good Music...Pandora   I have listened to Pandora music for over a year now, and I have enjoyed the freedom and variety of music offered through this app. It syncs well with my laptop and I know that it keeps a record of all my favorite ""thumbs up"" songs. I have appreciated the fact that the advertising on the app is not all intrusive, but is displayed in a small box in the center while the music plays on.My only negative, is that my music choice while enjoyable will tend to repeat itself more frequently after listening for a few days. The variety is limited and repetitive because it is free, but otherwise it is a pleasure to listen to Pandora. I believe it is worthwhile to invest in the paid version which offers more choices to those who can afford it."
32246,"Pandora",2016-02-20,5,"Five Stars   It's an App, it is for Pandora. That's what it does."

32343,"Pandora",2015-04-20,4,"Pandora is a fine way to listen to what you like in music.   I have just down'd Pandora and so far it is a fantastic App. It finds other music LIKE the song I pick and allows me to build what is called a Radio Station. Pandora suggests an artist or song and you can reject it or add it to your station. Once Pandora knows  what you like it will play songs from that artist, or era, (80's rock). I think it does even more but as I mention I just acquired the app. Also it's free with small pop-up ads, or you can pay and then no ads at all. I really like it!"

I usually listen from my television and after listening for a while it just shuts down- not sure if that is an issue with Pandora or my Internet carrier.

Between Pandora, Rhapsody and my iPod, and the radio I have more than enough for my music needs.  I love the concept of creating a personal radio station."
32495,"Pandora",2015-03-02,4,"It's fine but...   Choices like ""The Beatles Station"" should be ALL Beatles, not a mix of artists. Otherwise it's okay"
32497,"Pandora",2015-01-03,4,"Pandora   I really like Pandora but, there is way to many adds, and I like that if u close out of the app the music still plays"
32498,"Pandora",2016-02-12,1,"will not play music.   Fix it and I'll change my review."
32502,"Pandora",2013-09-15,5,"Great source for free music   Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better!In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"

32780,"Pandora",2016-05-22,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
32783,"Pandora",2016-03-18,5,"Five Stars   i love it.great music"
32785,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"Typical of most Amazon Apps   I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music.  I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it.  The Kindle, that is.  However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right.  Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers:  the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid.  Pandora is advertised as free:  download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE.  Not so, of course:  if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements.  If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever.  Ads pop up all over the place.  You can't see the album covers for ads.  Oh, but wait:  just pay the price, and the ads will go away!  The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad.  What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay.  I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle.  The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words.  The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time.  As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."
32788,"Pandora",2016-05-17,5,"Five Stars   Awesome!"
32789,"Pandora",2014-01-11,5,"Great   When your just roaming around the house and you need to have music playing this is great. You set up who you want to listen to and they play those songs and others like this group."

32853,"Pandora",2016-01-08,5,"Great music   I listen to Pandora most days and love that I can switch from one type of music to another at the click of a button. I listen to the 52 silly sing along songs station with my toddler, then when she goes to bed I turn on some country or pop music. There are commercials, but not too overbearing, as we do not pay for the Pandora One."

There's just one HUGE problem; the music won't play. That's right, even though that everything else works, the music, the #1 reason why this was made and why people bother using this is that only one thing that doesn't work. It works if you turn it off and leave it alone for an hour, but if you fiddle with it in the slightest way, the next track won't play. This is just sh*tty and weird from my experience. Oh, wait. There's one more thing that doesn't work; it's the search engine for music stations, which is also a pretty vital thing about Pandora... For those who're reading this review, I really don't recommend this..."

However, they let so many violent and pro-rape tracks slip through the cracks.

I have added many channels that feature artist/groups that I learned about on Pandora. I have Pandora One which for $ 4.99 a month keeps me up with the new music that is out there. This is really great when you around younger people and you name groups that they all like....hmmm keeps me young and is saying ""Cool"" still Cool? I sure hope so, but if not I guess I could say "":Sick""  and know that might be cool??? Dancingron"

I don't mind the commercials every couple of songs except for when I'm using it in the middle of the night for my year old baby boy,  playing the soothing sounds and then REALLY LOUD commercials jerk him awake. I just put it on really low volume now but then he doesn't really get the full effect. I love when they offer the free hour of no commercials and get so excited when it happens at night. Other than that, I use it daily and even have profiles for my five year old girl that has her kid stations on it that she made, which is a fab feature that our entire family loves! Will be paying soon to take commercials off, but only to help with little ones music. If that wasn't the case, I would have no problem at all with not paying. So don't delay!  Download today!  Enjoy music for your entire family at your fingertips! It's easy to use as well and keeps all your favorites =)"

37753,"Pandora",2016-02-08,3,"Meh.   Good music player... for things not on the local device.  Everything is streamed.  For some, this is awesome.  For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.Then, there's the randomness.  You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline.  And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.Not horrible.  But plenty of room for improvement."

Like a song or band or genre? Create a station and listen to similar songs you haven't heard yet. Like a song? Thumb it up and the station will play more like that, dislike one and thumb is down and it won't play it again.It's not as efficient when you selection songs or genres that are unique, but if you like an eclectic selection of music across different genres it works very well."

39135,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"No Regrets Downloading   I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."

It does seem to work well when I can figure something out, however."

If you have not used Pandora before, you will love the music, because you set the playlist name. As an example, some of my lists are named ""Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Connie Francis"". When you set this playlist, not all of the songs are by the artist listed. On the Frank Sinatra list, I get Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, and many more. On many days, I will switch between lists, depending on my mood. This app is well worth downloading."

I open it while at the computer, turn the music down low and am comforted while doing whatever on the computer.  Learned the ""hard way"" Pandora uses cell phone data.  Some kind soul advised me to connect to my in home wifi and I would not incur data overage.  One is able to set up their favorite music, Gospel, 60s, 70s, etc. and choose according to their mood which to listen to.  I am probably preaching to the choir.  A nice feature is Pandora is a free app.I am told it can be connected to one's computer.  Haven't tried this yet."

41111,"Pandora",2015-10-15,4,"Good Program that offers Thousands of selection choices.   A good free program except for the commercials.  I realize that they are necessay and that there is a Pandora One program tha is commercial  free, however, it would be nice if the would tell you the cost of the program before a person signs up for the trial period.  I am always concerned when I sign up for something not knowing what the ultimate cost will be if you deicde to keep the program."
41114,"Pandora",2014-05-18,2,"it's always running   I like Pandora.  When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc.  When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire.  This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days.  The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated.  I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used!  Some apps never stop running.  This seems to be one of them.  I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that.  If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem.  But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."

41944,"Pandora",2013-06-26,4,"Like It a Lot   I've been a Pandora subscriber for about 2 years.  For me, it's well worth paying for and it's taken the place of our defunct stereo system.  I don't use is as yet another social network; I just listen to music.  I would prefer having an option to listen to ONLY a particular person or group.  Being ""introduced"" to other similar artists is fine a lot of the time but there are times when I want to listen to only who I want to listen to.  The only downside is that if the Internet goes down, so does the music.  Overall, I'm pleased with Pandora and listen to it for much of the day, most days.  I plan to continue my subscription indefinitely ~~ unless they change something drastically in a way that doesn't work for me.  So far, It's a perfect solution for me."

42016,"Pandora",2013-01-10,5,"excellent   I love the fact you can make your own station. It plays the songs you like. It goes with you."
42017,"Pandora",2011-12-12,5,"Use it daily! Best app across platforms.   I have no idea what others are complaining about.  I have pro subscription so I don't get ads, but runs great on all my devices."
42024,"Pandora",2014-11-29,3,"I find the loop of music too short. I ...   I find the loop of music too short.  I only received my Kindle about 2 weeks ago and am already getting lots of repeat songs, which shouldn't be happening so soon with all the zillions of songs out there.  Also, when I click on the Beatles station, I get a lot of music before Beatles music happens.  Yes, I'm on shuffle, but I thought when I was on a station, I'd hear at least a lot of that music.  But the short loop is my primary dissatisfaction.  I haven't updated to the no-advertisement membership because I don't mind them.  I thought perhaps if I did upgrade, I'd get a longer time between repeat songs, but that's not what no-ads means, so I'm not sure that would solve the problem."
42028,"Pandora",2012-01-21,5,"great app   why is everyone crying about free music???? this app is awesome Works great plays exactly what I want to hear every time."
42033,"Pandora",2014-04-20,3,"It's okay   okay"
42039,"Pandora",2013-01-12,4,"hi   it is not that good but it a app what can u do lol so get it or dont haha"
42042,"Pandora",2012-03-17,3,"review   its ok but needs better options for phone. your music genre is next to none. volume control would be awesome."
42044,"Pandora",2012-02-04,5,"this an awesome app   best app i downloaded for my tablet. if you want to listen to music when ever you want i HIGHLY RECOMEND this app"
42047,"Pandora",2016-09-25,1,"My account shows that I have this app, but ...   My account shows that I have this app, but I don't - Every time I click on it, it says my 'session has timed out' (although I just tried opening it) and other times it says that 'an account cannot be set up for me at this time' (or words to that effect)."
42050,"Pandora",2015-03-10,1,"User unfriendly   Pandora used to have a nice interface.  Now it spams you with alarm notifications and ads that must be manually closed.  You have to go through 3 screens just to close the program.  It doesn't support the menu button.  It turns on and off randomly, so you can't let it idle in the background.  Perfect,  now after I have been bluetooth streaming in the car,  leave the car and let the app shut itself down, it will wake up on a whim at a random time and  blare music.  When I'm  in a meeting or library.  Awesome.... Fix your app,  Pandora.  There is no excuse for this laziness or intentional annoyance.  I know that I would never pay for premium  these issues."
42054,"Pandora",2011-11-22,2,"starting to hate ...   why all of a sudden it only play 1 minute of every song but plays complete commercials??????? Get this fixed ASAP!!!"
42055,"Pandora",2016-09-04,5,"Great   Love this! However, too many and too long pauses. Guess I'm having trouble with streaming. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
42061,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Love Pandora!   I have been using Pandora for years now and I absolutely adore the service! I must have 15 custom-created stations on it . Not only do i enjoy music I know but it also gives me the opportunity to hear new music and artists I have never heard before."
42065,"Pandora",2016-05-10,3,"Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in ...   I think the sound quality and volume varies a lot from song to song. Unfortunately which is just like radio. I have had Cirus satellite radio in my car for a while. I thought it was great! But for the $15 / mo. that they wanted for a subscription, they didn't have enough stations I wanted to make it worth while. I play cd's a lot because of sound quality and level.My wife only uses her Pandora once in a while."
42069,"Pandora",2016-10-29,5,"I Love this App   Love this app. I can listen to all my favorite artists and it selects music according to what I have listened to. Only downside is you can only skip 5 songs at a time and then you have to listen to what they have chosed."
42070,"Pandora",2016-11-14,5,"Love Pandora   I love this app, and will continue to use it even with the other apps out there. Pandora will forever be my favorite one. I wish it was free from ads, but I guess that is why you have the option to buy it without ads"
42071,"Pandora",2013-06-03,5,"pure amazing!   This app is awesome. So can make your own playlists by your favorite singers or songs. And most of the songs allow you to look at the lyrics for that song. Another reason why this app is awesome is because you can listen to songs for hours and they never pay the same songs over and over again. You can also taste the songs if they are playing a song that u dont like then u can hit the thumb down button and it will never pay that song on that playlist again. This app is great. I highly recommend this app. The only bad thing is you only get six skips per hour on each playlist. But when your listening to Pandora time flies by!"
42072,"Pandora",2015-07-30,5,"Pandora created a day spa station for me!   Pandora makes it super easy to assemble music of the same genre. I have created a lot of radio stations, but when I made a station from one particularly relaxing track (by David and Steve Gordon), Pandora found more music like it than I ever expected to find. I love discovering new titles and learning about the artists. This station is like being at a spa every time I hear the selection of music that Pandora plays. I hope Pandora will always be around."
42074,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"SMOOTH JAZZ   I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......A+++++++"
42076,"Pandora",2016-11-06,5,"Great software!   How can you not love Pandora? Whatever music you want, when you want it."
42078,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"Could always be better   I would give it 5 stars, if, when searching for a song, or creating a station based on a song, that song is played first, so I know I've chosed the right song/artist. Another reason for the less than perfect rating is the commericals. I understand the need for them, but not more than once every 3 songs. And not the same commercial every other time. I just shut it off and switch back to regular radio at that point. The final issue is buffering. Mine does that a lot, right in the middle of the song sometimes."
42080,"Pandora",2013-12-06,5,"I love it   nice"
42081,"Pandora",2016-03-05,5,"Better than listening to the radio!!!   I purchased the Pandora One subscription. There are several things I enjoy about Pandora. I have been able to check my favorites list when I wanted to check out a song I've heard for the first time I liked. Being able to give a song a thumbs up or down helps control which songs I want on rotation too. You can use the free Pandora with all the same features too. The only difference is the free version contains ads."

42091,"Pandora",2016-12-16,1,"Alarm clock feature broken   Whether it's Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
42104,"Pandora",2016-10-31,3,"Gteat idea just needs a little more development.   The idea of the program is great. But there are problems. One that occurs routinely is the loss of signal. The program will need to buffer. When that happens I need to open the application manager to force a program stop. Then when the program is reloaded it works again. Until the next time. A little more variety in audio programming would be good"
42107,"Pandora",2013-11-14,5,"For me, the best!   This is the bomb. I have been using it for 7 years via desktop and laptop, and now my Kindle also."
42110,"Pandora",2014-04-08,5,"Awesome App!   Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great  was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
42119,"Pandora",2016-05-17,4,"sometimes good, sometimes not quite   Works well and introduces you to new music similar to the station you choose. sometimes good, sometimes not quite. Still, a good way to learn and appreciate all the great music there is.  Just wish in the Classical stations they would play the entire piece rather than movements or excerpts.  Guess listening to something longer than a few minutes is very old school."
42123,"Pandora",2015-02-28,5,"The best!   Pandora is the Best invention to happen to music!  Where else can you Create your own radio stations according to your mood and the artists you like!  I listen to them every day as much as possible.  Amazon radio does not give you the choices. And it gives you information about the artist as it plays.  An awesome way to discover new music and artists.  Who needs old fashioned radio anymore?!  Get it now!You won't be sorry."

Other issues (delay, long silent pauses) may be due to my device, or cable connectivity (10GB), not the app, but I'm unclear. Also the UI isn't super intuitive i.e. how to look for other pre existing stations. But maybe I will like it more as I acclimate to the process. Thx!"
42131,"Pandora",2015-12-19,5,"Great to Find New Music   Pandora and their patented Music Genome Project tech allows them to play new music to you based on your listening history.The recommendations are almost always perfect, allowing me to hear new music I never would have encountered without Pandora. I have purchased music from bands I would have never listened to, and 99pct of whose music I find awful. But Pandora can find that one song that said band stuck on sone album five years ago, and see based on the songs Musical Genome that I might enjoy it. And I almost always do!Pandora and its Music Genome Project are light years beyond any other music streaming sites algorithms based on genres, playlists or whatever. The music industry owes Pandora big time for keeping people like me buying music I never would have known was just my taste."

42185,"Pandora",2014-08-21,2,"Total noise and disruptive w/ the frequency and number of ads   The periodicity and number of the advertisements are totally annoying and disruptive to listening - it may as well be listed & advertised as a freebie trial version. I've never used a music app that interrupted the continuity of my listening and disrupted my mood as much as Pandora does. Defeats the purpose of using such an app.  I would have to buy the ad-free version to have it. There are too many other free apps that substitute and can replace this one. After all the hype, I was totally disappointed."
42188,"Pandora",2014-04-12,5,"The most extensive music variety on the planet!   Pandora is quite simply the go-to destination when you are looking for a particular genre of music you can dial in and let play.  It's never let me down for variety of newer and older favorites of whatever type of music I am in the mood for and the best thing is, you can take it anywhere.  I like having it on my phone for portability in the car to hook up to my cars stereo or at home on my computer or stereo.  Wherever you are, wherever you go, be it near or far, it's Pandora!"

I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it. I do wish it would be easier to use with other devices, I usually hook up my laptop to my TV to use my whole house sound system while I'm cleaning, it would be so much easier to just play it from the Playstaion."

42193,"Pandora",2013-06-26,5,"Good stuff   I'm not a kid and don't get too worked up about ""my favorite apps"" and don't spend the day staring at my phone if you know what I mean. I absolutely love pulling up Pandora's 'oldies' stations on my tablet, plugging in the earphones and relaxing while my wife watches reality TV shows. ;o)Pandora is a pleasant surprise."
42199,"Pandora",2016-06-12,1,"Pandora isn't a true world wide company!   Wish i could give less than a star. I am tired of getting a skip limit when i don't want to listen to certain songs on my stations. Also Pandora is apparently not available to certain countries such as Ecuador. So when i was down there i couldn't even use the service or even cancel my service. Now back in the US i cancelled my subscription. Not dealing with it anymore after being a customer for a few years. Wish i cancelled it sooner. I have thousands of songs on my hard-drive just was lazy to deal with it."
42216,"Pandora",2013-08-13,4,"Music ...   Music, yes, but unless you go for more than the free app, you aren't choosing your music. It is Pandora 'radio,' not Pandora 'you pick it, you play it.' If you don't like the chosen song, you must still listen to it.It may not be just what I wanted, but I still give it credit. It is an awesome radio station and it is introducing me to a lot of new music based on the bands I do listen to which is far better than listening to the average airwave radio station.Based on ease of use and the fact that it was free, you can't hardly go wrong with this one. :P"
42217,"Pandora",2017-06-27,1,"One Star   i couldn't get it finished. didn't understand it. got frustrated and quit."
42218,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"A Musical treat...Glenn,Benny and Frank ; WOW.   Great music and a broad selection. Easy Access with excellent audio on my Kindle."
42219,"Pandora",2013-08-29,5,"Personalized   I love this app.  I love being able to personalize my own stations so that I get to hear the music I want to hear."
42220,"Pandora",2013-08-10,1,"Disappointing   I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD. I enjoy classical music, and I set up a Mozart station.  It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?))  Then it played some Beethoven.  Then it played an ad.  Two pieces of music, and then an ad.  I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad.  I immediately removed it from my Kindle."
42221,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"No, just no   Too many ads, you have to pay to get rid of them. They put albums in your radio station even though I only want 1 song.  It's a pain to set up specially since I already have my own music player with only so go I like.  :>p  I am deleting."

42224,"Pandora",2014-11-30,1,"Less than a star   I suppose this app is okay if one listens to only English music.  I listen exclusively to Italian & French music.  It is next to impossible to find the artists I love.  Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia,  Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar.  It is useless to me.  I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria."
42226,"Pandora",2014-11-08,1,"My kids love it; but my experience was awful   After I downloaded, I never got in successfully to listen to any music.  It kept spooling, and then, after it had me set up my user name and password, twice, it told me that there was an error and to contact their support.  After 5 minutes of waiting, I hung up and uninstalled the program from my phone.  My kids love it; but my experience was awful.  iHeart Radios was smooth and easy to download and I've never had a problem with it......guess I'll use that from now on."
42228,"Pandora",2015-12-30,1,"Won't play on kindle fire   Like many other recent reviewers said, the app doesn't work on kindle fire (or at least not on mine and theirs). Everything but the actual music will work -- I can see the songs playing, they just don't make any noise despite having the volume up. I'm disappointed and I hope they offer a solution soon."
42229,"Pandora",2016-01-19,5,"Five Stars   Music app for my tablet"
42230,"Pandora",2016-09-27,1,"Was a great music media app   More music then all the thousands of dollars that I wish I saved VS what was wasted on CDs and tapes, LPs and cassettes & Itunes It's a good app BUT now they stop it after 15 min.s of play, Ask you if your still listening, it stinks now before it was like a radio with your favourite songs, Now you have to press the button & start it again, Time to get another app, many others, so long,,, Maybe back if you go back to the old way"
42232,"Pandora",2017-01-11,4,"Free and awesome music, does it get any better ?   I have had Pandora for years ! I absolutely love it and the selection of channels and variety of music they have available. I am giving this a four star rating because I do wish new music would become available a little bit more often other than every few weeks on the stations you select to listen to. If you are looking for a good music station, I highly recommend Pandora. My absolute favorite internet radio station of all time !"
42239,"Pandora",2013-12-07,1,"Have always loved Pandora   I've always loved Pandora but on my Kindle it won't open up other than showing me the blue green opening Pandora screen.  Really sucks cause I've been a loyal Pandora user for a long time.  Hopefully it gets fixed."
42240,"Pandora",2013-10-20,1,"This app doesn't work on kindle fire HD.   I thought I'd download the app on my kindle fire HD just to see if all the reviews were true. They. Are. True. It's very frustrating that it works on a computer but not on my kindle. When you click on the app, it just shows the beginning screen and doesn't change. I hope they fix the bugs! (I can't complain too much because the app was free, but it's still frustrating.)"
42241,"Pandora",2013-08-31,3,"Love it and hate it   I love Pandora and am a paid subscriber.  However, every time I want to launch it I have to go into Apps and do a  shut down.  It doesn't always shut down internally even though I use the QUIT feature.  Then it will launch ok.  I talked to kindle support about this several weeks ago and they were able to reproduce the problem.  They said they would research and get back to me within five days but I'm still waiting.  I am getting ready to call them back."
42242,"Pandora",2013-02-23,5,"My Review   I just love Pandora - In the classroom I utilize their music to calm down my students....in my home I listen to my favorite type of music and so does my husband.....they really have a variety of music to choose from.....from the newest to the oldies...."

I don't have an email... there fore I claim this app to stink and is very unfair to other kids lacking the unneeded and stupid requirements this app needs just to play songs... why would you need an email to listen to a song...😑😑😑 not cool pandora... not cool...."
42246,"Pandora",2014-01-05,1,"Too much legaleeze   To be honest, I dropped this before actually trying on my new tablet.  I've had a good experience using it on a friends tv quite a while ago, but the requirements from the company now...!  Unbelievable what they require."
42255,"Pandora",2013-02-04,1,"could not get it to work   it kept wanting me to sign in and would not take my password and then they would ask for a new one and wouldn't take it."
42257,"Pandora",2017-06-12,1,"I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS AND IT SHOWED UP AS A PURCHASE IN MY ACCOUNT   This showed as a purchase in my account and I did not purchase it.  I now have to jump through more security hoops to secure my account though I THOUGH I had a pretty secure password."
42260,"Pandora",2013-08-17,1,"Goodbye   I love this app on my smart phone so I decided to download it to my Kindle Fire HD. The app worked great at first but n ow when I try to listen to it, the app won't open. I'll stick to using Pandora on my phone until this version gets fixed. Too bad, cause it was nice while it lasted."
42265,"Pandora",2012-12-30,2,"LOADED   TALK ABOUT ADS AND COMMERCIALS! ATTEMPT CHANGING SONG OR ARTIST AND POP UP ADS SPROUT UP LIKE WEEDS AND COVER MOST OF THE SCREEN. YOU SPEND MORE TIME DELETING ADS THAN LISTENING TO MUSIC, ONLY TO FIND COMMERCIALS ON THE NETWORK. RATHER LISTEN TO MY OWN CD PLAYLISTS I CREATED."
42267,"Pandora",2017-04-05,3,"Say,,,,, WHAT?   Hmmm,????  I don't remember buying this. It must have come as a free app on my phone. Guess I'll have to check it out."
42272,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"Spotify is much better...   Get Spotify not Pandora."
42275,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Pandora is My Favorite   What's not to love about Pandora?  Free music of my choice, artists of my choice, and the option to shuffle music for hours on end.  Sure there are the occasional commercials, but they can easily be tuned out just like tv commercials.  I really wish I could get Pandora on my home stereo system, and also would like to get it in my vehicle, but I do not own a cell phone.  LOVE< LOVE Pandora"

42282,"Pandora",2016-06-22,1,"no longer works   This app used to work but now it will only play music for 1 second then stop completely. Please fix or update thank you"
42287,"Pandora",2013-12-02,1,"Worthless   I can't log on to Pandora with this POS. ""We're experiencing unexpected technical errors."" I can get in with browsers but not with this thing. It's deleted from my Kindle."

42295,"Pandora",2017-06-22,3,"But love Pandora in general.   Hadn't used it all that much, yet! When I did it quit twice during a song."
42299,"Pandora",2015-03-02,1,"When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer ...   When I first listened to Pandora I accepted their offer of 3.99 per month.  All went well until my bank decided to change my debit/credit card due to hacking of local stores. Well then they didn't get paid. Instead of contacting me, they just cancelled the account. When I realized it I started Pandora again expecting to use the old account. Oh no, now I get charged 4.99 per month through my phone provider. . Then I had to get my phone replaced under warranty defect, and when I restarted Pandora it would just quit playing after a couple songs, and actually froze up.  I contacted them with the problem and their online chat person had me uninstall, and then re-install Pandora.  Now I am on the free use of Pandora with occasional advertisements, and I think I am going to leave it that way, because I have the feeling they just want more. I don't mind paying, but really, when you pick a music theme or performer, it plays the same songs over and over. So I think the free version is sufficient."
42302,"Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"A Must Have App   Maybe I'm a little basis since this is the first internet radio I have used. I have tried the others and always return to Pandora. The app is very easy to use and well polished. You can even continue to enjoy the music after leaving the app.Pandora now had an alarm that can wake you by playing your favorite stations. If you never tried Pandora before I definitely suggest you give it a try."
42304,"Pandora",2014-01-23,2,"Won't work overseas   I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats."

42313,"Pandora",2012-12-03,1,"Hated it   I downloaded iheart radio instead which is free too. Pandora is nothing but annoying ads in your face saying to buy a subscription to get this off blah blah blahDeleted it instead and got a better application."

42334,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Amazing with a problem.   This is a great app for music lover's! You can listen to the music while doing something else at the same time. The only bad thing is that you can only skip five songs a hour and adds come endless you by membership or whatever it is called"

42366,"Pandora",2012-12-14,1,"Not a good app.   The app constantly stops playing music. It will play a few songs and stop, usually when an ad pops up. You can purchase the ad free app though, but I haven't so not sure how well that works. I have talked to several others and they have had this same problem with the Pandora app. Not enjoyable"

42376,"Pandora",2013-04-12,1,"changed permissions   So Pandora did an update and they can now access my contacts and send them emails without my permission.

42377,"Pandora",2013-03-02,5,"If you love music... Pandora is great   I love using Pandora.  It is easy to set up.  It is easy to customize.  The more you use it... the thumbs up/thumbs down, skip... the better it makes your music selections."
42380,"Pandora",2014-02-09,1,"Pandora = Awesome   Pandora must be in the habit of spoofing reviews of itself. I never signed up for this, never created an acount, have never and will never, ever use it, and do not wish to be included with anyone who thinks Pandora is anything worth having.I am ready to sever all ties with Amazon if Pandora comes along with it. BUYER BEWARE,!!"
42385,"Pandora",2014-03-02,3,"Very good, BUT   Pretty good music selection as others have noted. My concerns are operational controls that are weak or lacking on my Nexus 7.1 Android tablet.When going to sleep there is no sleep timer since the last update, it was removed for Android tablets. Please bring it back. The big reason I miss the sleep timer is because when I am drowsey and want to turn Pandora off I have to almost wake up because of no quick way to shut  Pandora off. It requires a bunch of taps to turn off. Where oh where is my sleep timer for my android tablet????"

So would all of my friends.Less adds of course,the usual complaint.A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like.I would really like to be Abel to make a collection of songs to just put on repeat. If there is one pls tell me. I've looked everywhere."

42435,"Pandora",2013-08-31,5,"lots of fun   this definitely has every song on it that you can possibly think of... except for dave chappell which sucks. i listen to it all day at work, but be prepared for it to almost immediately drain the battery of any device that you are using to listen to it."

42446,"Pandora",2016-01-23,5,"Great music at your fingertips. Check out Pandora.   I love Pandora. It works very well on my Motorola DROID phone. It works somewhat less well in my Volvo car in that there is a long delay before the first track plays and a rather lengthy delay between each subsequent track. Also, often, Pandora in the Volvo will repeat tracks which is very annoying. But, I love being able to access my favorite styles of music for free and stream them for hours on end. I also like how I am able to listen to different takes by artists than those that are generally played on the radio. And, there are a number of live tracks that are played. It's all good stuff!"
42455,"Pandora",2013-02-22,5,"love the choices   this has many types of music to listen to and is fairly easy to use.  i am only an occasional listener so the free program was right for me."

42492,"Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora is a great way to appreciate radio.   Pandora is a really cost effective way to listen to the music that fits your tastes. It's a very effective tool to broaden your music horizons as well because the very intuitive music-selection system leads you into other songs and artists that you may not have known or appreciated otherwise. It's a very good way to reflect your musical preferences without becoming too tunnel-visioned in your musical tastes."
42494,"Pandora",2015-08-07,3,"What did you do Kindle/Amazon?   This is a perfectly fine app when it works, but there was some weird update to Kindle's that make it impossible to watch youtube videos and now Pandora is going haywire and skipping around all crazy. GET IT FIXED!"
42498,"Pandora",2013-07-04,5,"Love this.   You should get this if you don't want to buy music. The only problem I have with this is that you need to have internet to use it so you can't us it when ever. but it is a really great app I love to use it when ever I can."

42565,"Pandora",2014-02-21,1,"waste of time   yay! , music that you don't want to listen to is playing and you can't skip, because their agreement's don't allow it.. get an ipod or mp3 player and forget this app"
42566,"Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"Love Pandora   It's a great product--love my music! Easy to use, even for this grandma! Nice that it plays while I do other things on my Kindle."
42571,"Pandora",2014-05-04,4,"New Suggestion!   Ok, I absolutely love this app, I mean I don't have Pandora1 and I still love it, minimum ads,  free music, AND comedian stations. There is just one suggestion I have, and I'm sure others will agree. All the time I accidentally hit the ""like"" or ""dislike"" button, and you can't undo it unless you change it to the other. My suggestion is that we are able to unclick the ""like"" and ""dislike"" button, but other than that it's great."
42574,"Pandora",2016-11-27,4,"Great   I really like Pandora because it always has the music I want to listen to and it is so well made that navigation is extremely easy"
42575,"Pandora",2016-03-03,5,"Great Christian Music Stations   It wakes me up to the sound of beautiful Christian music every day. What a great start for strengthening my faith. I really appreciate the faith filled variety of inspirational sound."
42576,"Pandora",2013-06-25,1,"Pandora asked for my email password   I am not going to share my email password with Pandora and I did not see a way to get by that screen.  At that point I just shut it down and probably will not go back to it."
42580,"Pandora",2014-12-21,1,"new download   I just downloaded this app for my kindle, thinking I could sync it with my other account. Low and behold....I can't even get past the opening screen without being told my session has timed out. If I could give it no stars I would."
42581,"Pandora",2016-06-23,1,"Don't buy   I ordered 2 charms from this seller and both looked ""worn"" for lack of a better word. There was very little detail. Not happy and will only buy from a jewelry store from now on. Total waste of money."
42586,"Pandora",2013-11-10,4,"THE AD'S   I love the pandora app. It runs fast and smoothly on my kindle fire HD. But every few seconds there's a ad pop up and you have to pay a certain amount of money each month so that you can have it ad free which i think is a  rip off"
42587,"Pandora",2016-01-11,5,"Love it   App works great on my Fire tablet :) I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews!"
42599,"Pandora",2013-03-02,4,"annoying at times   My only complaint is that it stops to ask me if I'm still listening. Pandora, I am still listening so stop stopping!"
42600,"Pandora",2013-08-11,1,"STUPID   I waited 1 hour for the thing to actually work but it won't on my kindle.DO NOT get this app!!!!"
42603,"Pandora",2013-09-06,2,"Needs Updates   This is a great app in terms of the vast amount of great music of all types, although it lacks regular updates that come on iOS. If this app would regularly update I would not even be writing this review. The old version of this software (the version that is being used on Amazon) is not a perfect answer for your music, but it is as good as it gets. Amazon charges a seller fee for every sale and I believe that is the reason that Pandora does not give regular updates on kindle; they can get such a greater profit on iTunes and Google store. It is not Pandora that is doing a bad job; it is Amazon that is not allowing its customers to get regular! updates just for the small effects amount of money they get from it. Come on Amazon"
42616,"Pandora",2014-04-17,5,"Music just for you!!   If you like music?? Look no further!!  You have found it!!  Just tell the app what you like and there it is, Happy Listening!!!"

42627,"Pandora",2013-10-30,1,"doesn't work   This is potentially a great music app. At first it worked, then now all I get is the blue pandora logo screen. I cannot sign into it."
42630,"Pandora",2017-04-28,1,"didn't order   I didn't ask for it...have no idea why it came to me."
42632,"Pandora",2017-06-06,1,"One Star   don't know if it is Pandora or Amazon but I was not able to complete the set up.  Sorry"
42633,"Pandora",2017-09-08,4,"Four Stars   I like Pandora.  Easy to use.  Not many Ads.  In all its been a great app."
42635,"Pandora",2014-09-19,1,"Permissions/Privacy   You have to give this app permission to email your contacts without you even knowing?! I don't think so!"
42636,"Pandora",2013-10-08,5,"the best radio for music. ......A MUST GET!!!   Pandora is amazing... it lets you choose the music that you want to hear and pick your own station's. And once you get more than one station, the songs that you like will be played more often."
42640,"Pandora",2013-08-26,1,"Ads   Screw you and your never ending stream of ads that I will never use in my life, all I want to do is listen to some damn music"
42641,"Pandora",2013-04-11,1,"Not worth it :(   Too many comerials. I just want simple and play music. I will just use I Heart radio. Simple and no commecials Just ads on screen."

42646,"Pandora",2013-09-22,5,"Outstanding!   Great choices, fun for all music lovers.  It's a pleasure to be able to work on computer while listening to music I love."
42648,"Pandora",2015-10-21,3,"Pandora advertises free music, but then pushes for paid service   I liked it a lot when I started using it. There were plenty of ads, but I was able to listen to my kind of music at work without fiddling around with it too much. Then the day came when they would only play the music if I kept their app open on top--no going to another website. They wanted me to sign up for the pay version. Not happening. There are other options out there for free. I have uninstalled it."
42654,"Pandora",2016-12-22,5,"I have also been pleased with all the jewelry I have bought   I have been to two Pandora stores Oakbrook IL. and Pandora in ChicagorRidge both had very helpful and knowledgeable sales associates. I have also been pleased with all the jewelry I have bought. I love my bracelet and charms and plan to purchase more."
42657,"Pandora",2013-10-14,1,"Terrible   Well I would be able to listen to music then it stop working. Please fix it.Then I would maybe change it.."

42685,"Pandora",2013-07-28,5,"It's Pandora   It's an app for Pandora, it plays pandora, remembers me, and doesn't glitch out. If you expect more of it, you need to reconsider why you are downloading this app"
42686,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Difficult   At times it is difficult so get to the music and operate the system.  In all fairness, I am a new subscriber and am just trying to learn the system of operation."
42694,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"love it   love it, love it, love it, find a favorite artist or song and it is exceptional at matching your tastes"

42749,"Pandora",2013-11-03,1,"SMH.   SO, I actually love when apps get updates, because I love to see all the new features that it contains. For this app, in particular...Well, let me first start off with this. I've been a huge Pandora fan, for so long. Maybe even over four years. I have it on every device that I have, but I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to switch I Heart Radio, but I can't.  I But now, I believe it might be time to find a new radio. This app sucks now. The new symbol bothered me at first, but I'm used to it. But as soon as Pandora updated to 5.0, MY STATIONS DON'T PLAY. It keeps saying, 'We cannot find any more music for this station. Please, try a different station.' I did almost one hundred times and it keeps saying that. Pandora, you're about to lose a customer, if you don't get it together."

42817,"Pandora",2011-11-03,1,"permissions   Why do any of these apps need to access anything in your phone? I guess this is the cost of having an open system. I'll be ju jumping ship and moving to the iphone..

When you follow the link you cannot go to the Pandora web site even though the option is presented. You must go to the Amazon store which is frustrating in itself. At the Amazon store, you have to search for Pandora One and it then only finds Pandora. If you ever do get to Pandora One in the Amazon store it will not download or install. Pandora is great. Amazon Store is frustrating and I hesitate to use it"

It wasn't showing up in my BlackBerry World list of installed apps, though there was an icon on the home screen.  So, I went to the Amazon App Store, from which I had installed the app, and acted like I wanted to install it again.  It told me that I already had installed the app...and then the app opened.  I logged in and listened to a few minutes of music, then closed the app.  I expected not to be able to re-launch the app, but lo and behold, it launched fine.  I then went to BlackBerry World to recheck the list of installed apps and Pandora still wasn't listed, perhaps because it was installed via the Amazon App Store.  Regardless, I'm upping my stars from two to four.I am a daily Pandora user on Android devices, smart TVs, etc., and want to be able to use it on my BlackBerry Classic.  It installed, but will not launch.  If anyone has tips on how to get Pandora to work on a BlackBerry Classic running OS 10.3.2.556, I'm all ears!"

I have been using Pandora for well over 10 years and I think it is the best.  You can listen for free and get the occasional ad or pay a very fair monthly price and get ad free music with a lot of neat extras. I miss the days of AM radio with unbiased DJs and good music - the kind of music we listened to when cruising the boulevards back in the early sixties......Pandora brings that time back.  Works well with bluetooth."

43113,"Pandora",2017-08-15,2,"Dumbed down and prices raised = lousy annoying arrogant Pandora   Was a huge fan of Pandora for years - decent price, easy to navigate on screen, good music selections, many positives. But then something bad happened when they likely brought in some kids fresh outta college who decided to dumb it all down by make the computer screen huge with all items spread out towards all edges of your computer screen vs. original Pandora where it was all centered pretty much in the center. Now one has to constantly move your screen up down and side to side to see all function buttons.  Plus for this downgrade in features and functions, they started charging more money per month.  Plus there IS NO WHERE you can call, talk or email them about your complaints of concerns. NO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK avenues anywhere, whatsoever. Then if you want to cancel - NO REFUNDS - you just have to wait till your subscription runs out.  So they recently changed it all and then charge your card after the charge and screw you customers.  Maybe it's ok for your cell phone, but on a standing office or home PC there are much better options out there - I've switched to Amazon Music."

Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq.  Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone doesn't like the music i just type in what they like and there happy.  I did have problems getting a specific song but it really didn't matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version.  Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."
43128,"Pandora",2017-09-22,1,"You cannot add variety after you create a station :(   I used to love Pandora, have enjoyed it for years and subscribed to Pandora Plus a long time ago. I used to be able to create a station, and if I encountered a song or artist elsewhere that I enjoyed I could add them to the station later using the Add Variety feature. At least I could do it on my desktop app. However, that feature has apparently been removed. So now, once I create a station it's seeds are locked and I am stuck with the option of only liking/disliking the music that the station provides.There is still a Pandora Help page on how to Add Variety, but it's instructions don't work. I will stay with Pandora only because I have so much invested in the stations that I have created. But unless and until they include Add Variety again, I would NOT recommend this to a new user. I only hope that they include it again soon."

43151,"Pandora",2012-04-25,5,"Free Music!   If you are familiar with Pandora, then I can tell you that this app is a good version of the web based Pandora for your phone. Once you log in, it syncs with your account and shows all of your stations.Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference.You can have multiple radio stations, and you are allowed to skip several songs per hour (although it is not unlimited).However, after you use up all of your skips, you can just change to a different station, and then you get more skips for that hour. You can also upgrade to ""Pandora One"" for a $4.99 monthly fee. That gives you unlimited listening with more skips and no ads (although, in my opinion, the ads in the free version are not too frequent or intrusive) however, there is still a ""skip"" limit with ""Pandora One.""There is also the option to purchase a one day pass of Pandora One for $0.99.  That might be something to consider if you are having a party and want to use Pandora music without any ads.This is a good app and service for someone that has specific tastes in music, and is happy listening to a random selection of songs similar to those interests. If you are looking for something that allows you to pick the exact song you want to listen to, then this is not the app for you.The app now includes an alarm function that you can set for a specific time to start playing music from a specific station that you want to wake up to. Conveniently, it allows you to specify which days of the week you would like it to work on (for example, only on weekdays). It also has a snooze function that you can specify duration for.There is also a ""sleep timer"" that allows you to set the app to stop playing music after a certain time interval (currently 15, 30, or 60 minutes) so that the app doesn't play music all night while you sleep."
43154,"Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet   After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best.  The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all).  Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.  Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music.  It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements.  Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
43158,"Pandora",2017-04-07,3,"Pandora's new GUI is awfull!   Pandora is a great music player. I like the selection of music they play for me in the four or five genres I play the most. There are a few advertisements per hour in the free version and that's tolerable.I gave them only three stars because the new user interface is absolutely horrible. Pandora must have been compelled to make things move and make information disappear from view until you direct the cursor over the pictures to make the information visible again. Why? The old interface was simple, clear and functional. Some inexperienced kid out of college must have needed a job and Pandora hired the kid to make the GUI as hard to use as possible. But, the music is good. They don't make it, just play it."

43226,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Edgy, Artistic Opportunity   Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying."
43228,"Pandora",2013-07-03,5,"Pandora   I am technically ignorant and was very glad my children showed me how to have music at the touch of my hands anytime I wanted."
43231,"Pandora",2012-07-08,5,"Why the Hate?   I don't get all these comments about commercials every other song or other annoying things. This app works great for me on my Kindle Fire! I hardly ever hear a commercial- at most one per hour. I put in an artist that I love to be the station and so far it has given me a great variety. Also, I have not had problems with songs messing up when I am using another app- maybe the occasional tiny pause but that's it. Overall, I love this app and see no problems with it. :)"
43233,"Pandora",2013-11-06,4,"Superb player held back by an American-style jumble of IP holders.   I'd never be able to broaden my horizons if not for Pandora. I don't even bother with owning an archive anymore. However, the song selection is a bit limited, and some of the hoops Pandora has to jump through to keep its numerous license-holders happy end up putting odd quirks in the program. It will never be Spotify, but it's not enough to detract from the program, and Pandora One is dirt-cheap compared to other advertisement-free tiers in other programs.Despite any possible shadows of disadvantage, Pandora has changed my relationship with music."
43235,"Pandora",2016-05-08,5,"A Treasure Box of Music Just Waiting For You To Let Pandora Out of the Box   If you like music you can't beat this app. It plays only the types of music that you like to hear. If a choice of a song is not to your liking just give it a thumbs down and it is gone. I chose four different genres of music when I first got the app and listened for two hours and only snubbed two songs. I felt like it read my mind as to what I would play from my personal record collection. The ads are not that frequent  and do not last long either. Get this app now and you won't be sorry."

Unlike other music apps this one is don't just play the same genera it goes a level deeper and plays the same like arts.  For example if you like rap music and select Ice Cube radio it won't just play gangsta rap music it will play west coast rap music because Ice Cube is a west coast rapper.  The only downside is now this app is getting popular, being added to cars etc... so there are now commercials after 4-5 songs.  You have to purchase it to be commercial free."

Pandora has a tendency to stop and then I have to restart.  Sometimes it is really bad.  (I have no problems with Radio Paradise).  Mostly it is on shuffle and in spite of the fact that I have not put an arrow on Christmas songs Pandora manages to slip one in here and there.  Most annoying since it is not December but March.  It also is quite repetitive in the choice of music. I still give it four stars."
43284,"Pandora",2017-10-20,3,"Used to be a great product.   Used to be great, now more commercials than music. Also has a disturbing tendency to just stop working. Lastly, when used on my Android it states that it requires the installation of Amazon Appstore (yet it doesn't need it to run?!)."
43290,"Pandora",2013-03-14,5,"Get this app!   Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you won't regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
43293,"Pandora",2017-08-11,5,"Miles Davis Radio The Best!   Fantastic Variety of Music!"
43295,"Pandora",2013-11-22,5,"Pandora amazes me, and I'm a vinyl and radio junkie from way back.  Don't cheat yourself; try this one!   Pandora offers you the ability to create your own radio stations based on your musical style choices and the artists whose music you enjoy the most, and it's commercial free (if you pay the modest $36.00 US or so per year).  Although you cannot at this time request a specific song, you'll get commercial-free tunes in any genre you choose.  I can't recommend Pandora highly enough.  If you're tired of normal radio, try Pandora.  You'll listen to deep cuts from most of the artists you select, as well as the top hit tracks from the albums you love.  It's almost like having your record collection with you wherever you go!  Try it....I'd be really surprised if you don't love it.  You define your stations however you'd like.  Then, shuffle them to present yourself with a variety of your favorites no matter what they might be."
43298,"Pandora",2014-01-23,4,"great app   I've been using Pandora for years and an always amazed by how will it chooses songs.  I made a 6 hour car trip with a couple of my teenaged kids a while back and we listened to the same Pandora station for the whole drive and never had to skip a single song.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because you can't necessarily get the exact song you are looking for, you may have to wait a few songs for it to come up."
43300,"Pandora",2016-11-18,5,"Keep the music going!!!   The music on this app is incredibly great."
43305,"Pandora",2016-10-23,5,"Good 2 me   Very good to me"
43307,"Pandora",2017-07-20,5,"Cool stations, from Jazz to Punk!   Great service, works well with my Tap and Dot, love to be able to say Alexis, play some soft Jazz or Daft punk, and, I'm off to great music land. Love it all!"
43309,"Pandora",2017-06-22,5,"Fantastic app   Great app! You can set up individual radio stations for your favorite artist and Pandoras' software will follow the artist music types and play other artist that you probably never heard of. I have set up other stations from these Pandora suggestions and I am very happy with the results. The over the air radio stations are clueless on how to follow out the music types the public likes. I tracked over the air staions and they all have a 90 - 120 song rotation but Pandora is unlimited. Fantastic app."
43310,"Pandora",2017-09-26,5,"way Pandora adds selections that similar to every other song and each one gets better and better   Unbelievable , way Pandora  adds selections that similar to every other song and each one gets better and better. I did not know there were that many artist with such talent !!!"
43312,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"A programable music station catering to what you want to hear!   I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I didn't know what to expect.  I was surprised to find it easy to use and it's free.  Not many bargains like this today.  You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day.  Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music.  You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song.  You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations.  Share your stations with others also.  What's not to like."
43314,"Pandora",2016-05-11,1,"Prepubescent creation at best! Do not expect Factual information   I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I've come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."
43321,"Pandora",2013-09-07,5,"Gives me more of what I value...   If you love music and discovering new music, Pandora is the single best reason for broadband access.I listen to music every day. My musical tastes are diverse and I love to discover new artists. Until now, I've listened via my computer at home and work. I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I just purchased a smartphone primarily so I can listen to Pandora on the go.I realize other people value different experiences and functions but, for me, this new phone and app added a large measure of joy to my mobile days.As far as the app itself, I just started using it so I've got an impression, not an opinion. I need more time and data for that. However, it works similarly to the desktop app and browser versions. I haven't run across a big hurdle yet."

43337,"Pandora",2013-02-22,5,"My Bose has dust on it.   I have stack and stacks of unused cds since discovering Pandora.  I've made classical and Latin and alternative and celtic stations, just to name a few, and with a few ""like"" and ""dislike"" clicks on various pieces of music, my stations play a wonderful blend of all the things I like best.  I love the way one can add variety to any given station by suggesting different artists, composers or compositions.  Pandora has taken the hours and hours of work out of making the perfect personal blends of music for any occasion.  Highly recommend."

43516,"Pandora",2016-06-30,3,"I really expect high quality audio for streaming.   I noticed Pandora used to stream 192 kbps for free with advertisement.  Now it looks like you have to pay to get that quality.  That stinks.  When I pay I would hope they at least stream at 320 kbps.  Really, they should stream lossless as an option in the settings.  It's like paying for satellite radio.  Why would I when the quality is set so low?  Everyone has just gotten away from really listening to albums because there way too much loss at these qualities.  Pandora, please upgrade to a higher streaming kbps.  Otherwise, I'll never pay for it.  You are now asking us to pay for 192, when you used to offer it free.  What's the incentive then?  None."

The tablet app is so easy to use and makes listening to my favorite songs very enjoyable. I have 5 ""radio"" stations setup and switching between them give me the songs for those different moments. I don't even need the DELUXE version since the short 30 second adds are far less than any radio. I think they ""interrupt"" less because I rate each of the songs as I listen and relax.

Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
43556,"Pandora",2013-09-22,4,"Great way to hear new music!   I used it when I heard an artist was coming to play in our town and I was unfamiliar with their works. I plugged in the name of the artist and heard some of his works, but also heard other performers who were similar in style. As it turns out, I was familiar with some of the associated artists so it gave me a better idea if I would like to go hear the live performance of the original artist. This is a great resource for an introduction into new artists and genres."

It gives you the option of likeing or dislikeing, skipping a song, looking at previously herd songs, and making different personalized radio stations.

I fear this world is not going to know what real music is anymore if you change."

You make different stations and can set them up in different genres to your liking. The commercials are not too frequent, which is surprising. I have no complaints with this app. It is free and the music is too, a wonderful addition to your kindle.Hope that helps."

I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa (you get my drift..) so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I'm being picky but it does get annoying when 4+ times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."

Lovely, I was transported to the  world of early music for a full afternoon while I painted from my Kindle. It has nicely followed my next entry, composer Nikolai Korsakov. Not a problem. Another afternoon of Russian romantic music, orchestral. How did I live without this?"

43661,"Pandora",2014-01-02,5,"It's YOUR music, YOUR way, YOUR time...   I love Pandora.  I have the premium package but the free version is good too.  I love the ability to have customizable music by genres.  This was especially a wonderful app during Christmas when I could THUMBS UP or THUMBS DOWN any Christmas selection I liked or disliked.  When Christmas rolls around again, Christmas station will be even better.  I love a variety of music and Pandora IS the app for music lovers."
43670,"Pandora",2014-10-08,3,"I like Pandora. Use it everyday   I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."
43675,"Pandora",2017-10-28,1,"great for a few years   installed Pandora app for Kendle a few years ago.  worked great until a few weeks ago.  Now says it can't connect to Pandora.  Tried uninstall.  This moved the defective program to the cloud.  Told it to reinstall, so it recovered the defective program from the cloud, and it still doesn't work.  can't find a way to delete from the cloud and install a fresh (working) copy."

43680,"Pandora",2015-10-03,4,"Great for Discovery   Overall, Pandora has a seemingly infinite array of music available for playing and I love to discover new music and artists that I might like. I really find the fine-tuning feature helpful because it allows you to obtain a more specific music taste. Thanks to Pandora, I now regularly listen to Melanie Martinez, Marina and The Diamonds, Lana del Rey, and many other amazing artists I'd never think I'd discover. It's a great app for those who wish to expand their personal music library."
43684,"Pandora",2016-03-25,3,"not a big fan   in this day and age I don't really like some one or (something) choosing my music for me  then turning off after inactivity hit me with comercials  no thanks its Spotify for me"
43686,"Pandora",2016-08-01,5,"Love.   I love Pandora and always have, it's never crashed on me and it doesn't take as much data as all of the other music streaming apps."
43690,"Pandora",2015-07-22,4,"Great App with an Annoying Flaw   The app is fantastic. I love listening to music when I'm driving or working; however, it is very buggy. I have yet to listen to the app for a solid hour without issues. Usually, it just needs restarted, so it's not a serious problem, but it does get annoying."
43697,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T! I!T!, G!E!T!I!T!... GET IT!!!   Pandora simply ROCKS, you can listen to music on it, and create your own stations, give thumbs up or thumbs down to songs, and much, much more. I pay a dollar only a month for it, but I could pay $4 for Pandora one a month, it allows you to skip as many tracks as you want, and doesn't have any advertisements popping up like regular pandora I prefer. YOU GET IT, then decide after the free trial if you are to upgrade it, leave it the way it is, or stop using it. Your choice."
43698,"Pandora",2015-06-26,5,"Great application   I really like having music on my Kindle.  It is only draw back is when you don't know the internet connection."
43700,"Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"Personalized Radio   Pandora makes it easy to find new music.  Based on my requests, Pandora plays a similar selection of recommendations just for me.  I like having the choice to give a new song a ""thumbs up or down"".  If I don't like the music, Pandora stops and moves on to the next recommendation.  This is great!  I have discovered and bought more music in the last year thanks to their recommendations."

43711,"Pandora",2015-09-05,4,"Is a great music app   Is a great music app, and I love that it has international artists as well. Just sometimes I don't really care so much for the selections chosen for you when you create a station around a certain artist, as sometimes I don't want to hear someone else."

I've been listening to Pandora for years they have a great selection of genre and we can rate the music as it is played.  Thank you Amazon for having Pandora available and for free"
43719,"Pandora",2013-09-17,5,"Awesome Music!   I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!"
43720,"Pandora",2017-03-29,1,"Service Please   Love this concept. Lots of trouble on my Amazon fire phone. There's no way I could ever even think about upgrading to the no commercials. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling. Why can't we all get Pandora's full benefits? If it is not for all phones, just say so and be done with us! You should be able to accommodate Fire phones, others have found a way. You are dragging your feet and we would like some service!"
43722,"Pandora",2012-11-10,5,"Love it!   There is nothing more enjoyable than being able to type in the name of an artist or music genre, thensit back and listen. If a tune comes on that you don't care for, simply click on the ""thumbs-down""icon, and another song in the genre you have selected begins to play. If you tire of one type of music, simplyclick and select a new one."
43723,"Pandora",2014-05-25,5,"Best way to find new music   Pandora is great because you hear artists you wouldn't have otherwise, based on your preferences. I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and thrives on finding new artists and genres. My only problem with it is that there are more ads than there used to be and the price of a subscription to get rid of the ads has gone up. However, it is only $4.99/mo, which is affordable and worth the expense."
43725,"Pandora",2014-05-08,5,"Pandora At Last   This app is so wonderful! I love being able to hear the music and comedy routines that I love without buying anything and without putting up with a D.J. It is just the music I love. I have my oldies and the most current.The only problem I am having is the wake up to music feature. I may not understand it yet.  I just got an alarm with no music."
43730,"Pandora",2015-11-02,5,"Great music, price is right...free with Amazon Prime   Love it wish they would play the forties stuff, love the old war years songs, even though I wasn't there..."
43735,"Pandora",2015-06-22,5,"We like it.   My much beloved spouse likes Pandora very much. He uses it a lot and is quite pleased with it. If he is pleased, then I am delighted. Very very nice."
43736,"Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"I love it   I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want."
43738,"Pandora",2016-09-03,5,"Just Great Music, Any Genre   Pandora on my phone/tablet is perfect, pair the phone with blue tooth speaker at work or home, or blue tooth in car and no advertisements or DJs talking to cut into the music."

43741,"Pandora",2017-07-19,4,"Nice good sounds !   Nice to be able to hear some of the old songs again, most of the radio stations don't really play 'oldies but goodies! Clue. It's not 1990's !"

Somewhat being that if you like a song and indicate as a thumbs up you will get more of the style of music.  You don't really get to pick the music you pick the style or similar music.  If you do it long enough most of the music that you here will be ones that you like.  Since I have loaded Pandora I have almost never turn on television but I do love music.  It is simple to figure out easy to understand all you have to do type in a favorite artist or style of music and let it pick the music, all you have to do is give it a thumbs up ( I like it) or thumbs down (I don't like it)  It is worth the download.  Try it"

43761,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"Glitch?   I had this app for the longest time but just recently when I open the app and select a station, songs continually pop-up (not playing them) they just pop-up and don't stop until I close the app. I don't know if it's just my kindle or the app."
43763,"Pandora",2013-08-27,5,"Satisfaction with Pandora   I LOVE Pandora............have it on my phones, TV, Computer etc.  I love the option to download and specify certain artists and songs..........creating my own playlist if you will."

43769,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"Love Pandora!!!!   Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears.  Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"
43770,"Pandora",2014-04-16,5,"Absolutely Amazing!   If you love music this is YOUR app! First, the app is free and so is the music! If your into singers like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato it gives it you! Or if you like rock bands like Metallica or Nirvana they have it too! All you have to do is search the band/singer name and it will come up. And also if it's your favorite song, you can like it and it will play at times. I love this app and so will you!"
43781,"Pandora",2013-12-27,5,"Amazing breadth of music.   I subscribed to Pandora to get rid of the ads and allow it to stay on longer.  I was hoping it would let you program in some of your own favorite elements - I knew it wouldn't take a play list, which is fine - but it works about the same as the free station as far as what songs come up.  Since I work at my computer, I am right there to like or dislike selections, so with diligence I can get a station to play a very specific sound.  I believe with my subscription I also get to click on the likes/dislikes more times per hour.  I would recommend the subscription to anyone who uses Pandora a lot and can take the time to ""design"" a station."
43782,"Pandora",2017-09-15,2,"Free but the Advertisements makes this not so good   PandoraToo many advertisements and they come up where it is easy to accidentally click on the advertisements.Free is good, but not when they put advertisements where you can accidentally click on them."

Plus, mom & dad can have a station too.  As many as you want with different genres.  We can play it on our tablets, phones and TV.

43820,"Pandora",2013-10-02,5,"Best Music Radio App   I've been using Pandora for years and I have I on all my devices, my Optimus and iPad. I have tried other music app as well, but I always end up going back to Pandora. I really love the recent changes they've made to it like the ability to add variety to your stations and being able to preview and listen to new albums before they're released. If you love a variety of music and want to be able to actually choose some  your own selections of songs, you'll love this app. Pandora is one of those apps that you absolutely need o have on your device if you love music. There's no way you'll be disappointed with it."

I got the update, wondering what would be different, and now I can only listen to 40 hours of free music on a mobile device.  I can still listen on my computer but my tablet has better quality speakers.  Now I don't listen to Pandora as much as I used to and that makes me upset.  If I had unlimited free music like I used to I would give it 5 stars.  You can pay four dollars a month to remove ads and have unlimited music but I not paying money for the subscription"

It works just like the mobile app. Ok the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app, you have to pretty much go to your Home Page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap ""Quit"". If you tap the Home button, it continues to play in the background. No big deal, and its a little weird to me probably because I've only had the Kindle for a little over a month."

The app is good but it could use a little help with auto scaling and scrolling for smaller and square screens.

43880,"Pandora",2013-04-14,3,"Its nice   Not the best app ive seen but its better hen other radio apps. The reason I'm giving it three stars instead of five is because it picks songs that are picked by other people that like your song and that's why its amazing but if you don't like the song you can either skip it or dislike it that's not bad but you have limited skips and everytime you dislike a song it skips it every hour of listening you gain some skips. And also you HAVE to have Internet to use this app."
43886,"Pandora",2013-02-24,4,"pandora   Pandora allows you to listen to music for free - however, you cannot choose the specific song that you listen to. It works by asking you to specify either songs or artists that you like. Then, it creates a custom radio station tailored to those preferences. It learns your tastes when you vote on songs by indicating either a ""thumbs up"" or a ""thumbs down."" From those indications, the stations becomes more closely tailored to your preference."
43887,"Pandora",2013-03-29,5,"Stellar app!   What can a person say about a music service that customizes one's listening taste into an intuitive music playback service?  It's great and worth having, unless  you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again.  Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music.  In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU!  How good is that!?"

I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to.

I like the Seekers, The Carpenters, Keali'i Reichel, Asuca Hayashi, Marty Robbins... and a whole bunch of other artists that are no longer (if they ever were) mainstream.  Very hard to find a radio station that plays ""my"" music.  This app logs into your Pandora account and plays your music for you.  No issues, just pure functionality.  What's not to like?"
43962,"Pandora",2013-06-08,4,"Amazing   This app is so fun! It requires internet so you can't really play it anywhere, but that's the only really I can find. It helped me find new songs that I've never heard before and surprisingly I like those songs. The music range is so wide that you can pick basically any type of music, even instrumental and foreign.  I recommend this to anyone who hasn't installed this yet. You won't be disappointed!"
43968,"Pandora",2013-08-03,4,"Almost perfect   Very good app, but I wish they would allow for better mix of music like dj mixes.  There are other app that give those options, like SoundCloud and FitRadio.  It's a bit annoying to receive a message asking if I'm still there listening, like I'm supposed to be holding the phone at all times touching the menu buttons....stop it with the separation anxiety Pandora!!!"
43971,"Pandora",2016-12-05,5,"It give such a great variety of music   Of course I use Pandora everyday. It give such a great variety of music, music that is not played on my local radio station. I love it."

43979,"Pandora",2015-12-22,5,"awesome   I recomend this app for and to everyone.You keep your track right on this and it doesn't take much space up at all! it has old songs, new songs, and much much more :) please get this app.... you'll enjoy it"
43982,"Pandora",2013-08-31,2,"Love It When It Works!   I was very happy when I discovered the Pandora app for my new Kindle Fire. However I came to realize. It only works when it what's to. It works great for one day, and if you try to use it the next day. It freezes on you. So disappointing!"
43985,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Good music station"

44000,"Pandora",2014-05-12,4,"Requires time   I have been thumbing up and down songs for five years now. Once you have spent time culling through the collection, it becomes a wonderful radio station that plays 90% of just what you like. Until you have put in that amount of time, it will play totally random stuff that has nothing to do with the song seeds you started with."
44002,"Pandora",2016-05-14,5,"I love Pandora!   Pandora enables me to stream a huge variety of music genres on my Bose system at home and on the go on my mobile devices.

44006,"Pandora",2017-08-15,3,"The music selections are great but the stop   Songs are erratic. Stop ,start, stop, start then ""playback error"". Would pay for a subscription if not for that. The music selections are great butthe stop, start is annoying."

It's better than any other music App.  It is free and you can listen to particular songs, genre, or albums that you love.  We were looking for a real radio station with holiday music, when I thought, wait a minute, let's listen on Pandora. My sister had me install Pandora on her phone right then.  It is great!"
44030,"Pandora",2014-11-29,4,"Pretty Cool Stuff. But...   Pandora is amazing but sometimes  the person your interested in, in music of course the he/she s music wanders off somewhere else. Say for instance you wanna hear  Taylor Swift after a while it goes to lets say the band  Maroon 5. BUT I would suggest it. It's free anyway."

44055,"Pandora",2013-05-23,5,"Though I do, There is no point of buying music with Pandora, SoundCloud, etc.   I'm a DJ/VJ.Subscriber to White-Label, Virtual DJ Premium, ASCAP, and was a subscriber to 3 other labels.The industry should and is going down in CD sales with Pandora, Slacker, MusicTube, etc. and alternativesto.net but it's the era of making money in other ways like product placement and adds.There is really no point to buying what we use to buy with advertisements on Pandora, etc. and Office Starter for example. And the industry is going that way, BTW.Pandora is worth it. $36 for 1 year. Free if you want to take more advertisements.XM I can get 6 months for $25.Everything is going open source. And the advertisements are getting heavy.For all relating to Open Source/ie free/ the best website to figure this out is alternativesto.net"

44063,"Pandora",2012-06-16,5,"Bring Pandora to your mobile device   This app lets you enjoy the Pandora music stations that you've come to love on your desktop or laptop computer on your mobile device.  Once it's downloaded and installed on your device you can sign in and enjoy all the stations that you've created on your computer or make some new ones from your mobile phone.  Any stations you create or songs that you rate on the mobile will be integrated with your computer stations so you don't have to miss a step.  Next time you log on to your computer it will be right there.  Or vice versa. Your ratings will also be accessible on both of your devices or any devices where you install Pandora.Yeah, there are a few ads, just like on the web.  But they're short compared to commercial radio.  And you can always upgrade ($36 per year at this time) and you won't hear any ads at all.  The music will be higher quality (192K bits per second) and you can listen for 5 hours at a time without ever touching your device."

44085,"Pandora",2017-09-23,5,"very great music   and the cool part is that when you get a soundtrack,it plays some of the music, but it plays music like it and that's what makes it fun."
44089,"Pandora",2012-05-18,5,"Music your way.   This review is for those who are not yet familiar with Pandora. Once you create an account, it is like running your own radio station. You create your own channels by typing in an artist's name, such as ""Beatles"". You now have a channel that plays ramdom Beatles songs mixed in with songs from similar artists like The Rolling Stones and The Who. The basic application has no fees, and in my experience only throws in a 20-30 second commercial after every 15 to 20 songs. Pretty darn good for free! I don't know if there is a limit to the number of channels you can create, but I have at least 30 of them. One of the best benefits of Pandora is being 'turned onto' artists that you didn't know about, that are similar to some of your favorites. All your channels are saved online and connected to your account, so they can be accessed on all your devices (computer, tablet, net box, smart phone, etc.) without having to recreate them. If you're a music lover, this is the BEST free service on the internet."

44127,"Pandora",2014-12-29,4,"I love my Pandora   I have been using Pandora for free for 3 years and I love it. My only complaint is that lately the advertisements are becoming more frequent and if you have a station set for a long time, songs start to repeat alot. To fix that just delete the station and make a new one."

44140,"Pandora",2012-04-01,5,"Reliable, good interface, and good quality   Contrary to what some of the spotlight reviews have mentioned, I've nothing but good experiences with this Pandora android app.Connection has been good with my T-Mobile 4G network. It usually buffers for 10 seconds and the song fully plays. I've experienced no hiccups with this app. It may depend on your network, location, and signal strengthThe interface is very user-friendly. There is a full size image for the song/artists and then the familiar bottom bar -thumbs up, thumbs down, pause, stations, and next. On the top right corner, there is an ""i,"" which lets you read a short description on the artist and the option to look at the lyrics.For the most part, the music is of good quality. Playing the pandora music through my headphones and car speakers, highs and lows are still distinct. It's not the best, but definitely passes for radio quality.Still a solid option for music streaming."

44177,"Pandora",2012-01-20,4,"for those with probs   if you had trouble changing the station(on the Kiele fire) then try go down below to where the home botton is and hit the botton in the middle with lines or the one that looks like a list and it will give you options.  just play around with it and you will find it, or if you just change to the station just hit the back botton.  now yes there are advertisements that play after 3-4 songs but the only way Pandora will be free is if they do those advertisements. they only last about 30 seconds.  i  have left my kindle fire on all night once with Pandora playing and it did not die. if you leave it playing but hit the power bottom the screen will turn off but music. still play letting you save more battery power.Pandora is not good nor bad it just depeneds if you really want to PAY for the best servise. if you want free music of your choice on you kendle fire then maybe it is not so bad, but if you want the best then sure you can buy it."

44215,"Pandora",2015-01-30,4,"Good, but not great   The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app isn't quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting."
44219,"Pandora",2016-01-23,4,"First time listener   It is a great radio alternative.  I like that I can choose the type of music that I enjoy.

It loads really smoothly on my kindle and I love how u can read,play other apps etc. While listening to your music.

44250,"Pandora",2014-12-30,2,"It's now mostly ads with the occasional tune that doesn't crash.   I give it a two at best. On Android the app rarely if ever works right and more often than not you get a popup that says ""Pandora can't find any more music, try changing channels"" on every single channel even letting Pandora choose one. And on the web it's recently become totally unusable  as it now plays ads THROUGH the music nonstop. And it's it's same stupid ad for some health insurance company over and over over and over. Might be time to kiss this one goodbye. Looks like Pandora just got too greedy."

44260,"Pandora",2017-11-03,5,"Five Stars   Good"
44262,"Pandora",2013-12-30,1,"FREE: HALF TRUE   I loved  the Pandora app. When I first got it, it was completely free with ads. The ads were not  frequent so that was fine. I established many stations and enjoyed it immensely. Then one day I opened the app. It said UPDATE AVAILABLE"" so I touched the update choice. What a mistake. It told me that Pandora now allowed a limited amount  of listening hours. The amount was 20 hours. I  was very upset. I am totally disabled. I depended on Pandora each day .It is very hard to lay down and do nothing all day. With Pandora I could change the genre throughout the day as my mood changed. If you've ever had to endure a day of silence ,with no one to converse with you may have a glimpse of an idea of how unnerving it can be. Music has always been a big part of my life  now more than ever. I find solace in music. It occupies my mind and distracts me from the reality of how my life has changed. Everyone has heard of the power of music. It is true. It can lift you up,it can calm you down, it can entertain you, help the hours pass quicker or you can choose a genre that will help you meditate when you just need to disconnect. 20 hours is nothing for me. I am usually awake that long each day. Once the update installed it said I had reached my maximum for that month. I had to wait 3 1/2 weeks to listen again. I wrote to see if they could help. I don't have any disposable income to upgrade so I was offered 10 more hours...well that's an extra 1/2 day. So I waited. When I was able to listen again ""for free"" I noticed there were more frequent ads now to take up more time. I had asked what about all the hours not used by listeners each month. I bet not everyone uses their  free allotment. Perhaps they could draw from that to help provide More time to those who need it. No response. The UPDATE NOW message was a deceitful ploy to force you to pay for something that ,when you joined ,was free. I often wondered if I hadn't updated maybe I would still be listening for free. So, now I listen to other music apps. I can choose my music,make play lists, etc. and they are completely free. I have also since learned  that certain types of apps. including this one do not need to run at start  up. This allows them to monitor everything you do. If you have personal information,saved passwords, whatever ,they can gain access and even worse share your info. Do the other stations have the clarity of Pandora, no, but I will continue using them because they are truly free, no veiled traps. I originally would have given Pandora a 5 star rating but I remove 1 star for being  deceitful, 1 star for putting a limit on an app that was  free  and unlimited with never a mention of in app purchasing until the guise of an update was posted. I remove 1 star for increasing the frequency of ads once the limit was attached,reducing actual music time. I remove 1 star for their lack of interest in working out a  solution that would allow someone  who  had grown to depend on their product to literally get them through each day. A way of life they could never understand and I don't wish it on anyone. I have never asked for a hand out but when I asked about all the people who don't use their max and what happens to that time, instead of saying they hadn't considered that or they would check or would  even explore a solution they quickly said they would add a few hours and that was that. We were done. Discussion closed. For being so  quickly dropped after being a listener for about a year  I remove 1 star for disrespecting a customer who was evidently in need of their help. So Pandora you end up worth 1 star for the time I was a listener who thought it was wonderful of you to provide this service for free,although I hadn't known you were secretly monitoring my network usage and gathering information.  It's a shame we couldn't work this out but there are always other fish in the sea."
44266,"Pandora",2014-03-25,4,"Made a Scarlatti channel, a Vladimire Ashkenazy channel, Rubenstein, Horowitz   Lovely - all my favorite old school concert pianists, some lovely vintage recordings turn up as a nice surprise, and of course, Scarlatti wrote enough pieces to keep anyone happy for a very long time.  Interrupted by loud commercials now and then, but it is free, so cannot complain, and if I wanted, I could purchase it and avoid the ads."
44268,"Pandora",2013-07-25,5,"Pandora is and always will be awesome   Before teens in training bras, braces and socks in pants Pandora was there providing free radio and music that the local top 40 stations couldn't due to fat guys in suits making the rules. Now that the market is flooded with internet music providers, Pandora is still tops. Go Pandora. Even if I have to download an app for my digital manhood I still give them 5stars."

44283,"Pandora",2014-05-16,5,"Awesome   I really like having the Pandora app on my phone. I can listen to different stations without having to have a traditional home or car radio. I like that I can take it anywhere with me. I also like that I can go in and out of stations to find a song that I like or want to hear. If I don't like the current song I can just back out and then go to another station."

44292,"Pandora",2015-05-04,5,"Pandora Pleases   Fantastic App. Bigger choice of various music styles and artists than anyone could hope for. Especially for anyone who likes to hear songs that all have a different tune, and vocalists that don't yell and scream. It's available at Pandora. Plus an endless list of instrumental music.

44300,"Pandora",2013-07-28,2,"_   This app was an amazing adaptation of the web based Pandora. It was simple to set up and use and played a lot of good songs. The problem came when I logged out of it one night to charge my Kindle, (it drains your battery very quickly and won't charge at all even when no music is actually playing), and I couldn't log in the next day. When I click on the Icon, the title screen comes up, but it won't load pass that stage. I tried deleting it and downloading the app again but nothing will fix it! I hope I'm the only one that has this problem because it is really a great thing, but I just wanted to warn the next person who gets this that this problem might happen to them."
44303,"Pandora",2014-03-06,5,"Pandora is lifee!!   Thank you for makimg pandora it has and still is helping me with alot of things. So have this idea that I think that you should try. Ok so it could be a special that comes for a week then comes back 2 months later for a week. The special should be that we can have a station that is called my bookmarks and the station should be about where you can listen to your bookmarks in any order and you listen to just your bookmarks.I hope this sounds interesting to you so I hope that maybw you can try it out if you dont lile it you dont have to keep it THANKS,a listener...."

44310,"Pandora",2013-01-21,5,"Kindle Fire review   I got the free version and decided to upgrade to Pandora One. The commercials eventually got to me and I couldn't take it anymore. Enough about that. I have really enjoyed making stations and listening to music I would play if I had it, much of which I do own now. The links to buy the music make it simple to expand your collection.I like being able to insert comments and read what others think about the songs and artists.I got this app for my Mom's i-pad and it doesn't have half the flexibility as the one for the Kindle. I even got her Pandora One thinking it would add more usefulness, it didn't.My only complaint is there is only three ratings for the songs; like (thumbs up), dislike (thumbs down), and neutral (do nothing). I wish there was a really, really, really (you get the idea) like the song."

Also, there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version.  the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement.

My first use was on their mobile app. It took me a little bit of time to learn how to signup and setup my account, and it was a bit annoying, however after that the experience was great. The technology behind Pandora really predicted some really great music for me. I really loved how I could discover new tracks. In fact, even though other services have other features, thus far, Pandora has helped me discover the most music. The app feels solid, nothing brilliant, but it does what I want it to do, play music. It has a modern look, with slight bugs but it doesn`t really matter. Great service, and must try app!"
44425,"Pandora",2014-02-28,5,"Best radio option   Pandora does an excellent job of playing the music I like. It is better than a theme dedicated radio station because I can mix types of music, such as country and blues. I can take it anywhere on my kindle. Commercials are few and unobtrusive. Superior to subscription satellite radio, this is the best music option for me."
44426,"Pandora",2014-01-28,4,"Pandora is Great   My grandchildren have been telling me about Pandora for quite a while but it's just since I received my new Kindle that I have actually tried it.  I love being able to select the music which I enjoy the most while not listening to music I don't like as well.  The pop ups are annoying and I understand I'm able to pay eight dollars a month and not have them but that is too expensive for me on a limited budget.  How about discounts for seniors???"
44427,"Pandora",2014-03-15,3,"A nice way to hear old favorites.   I enjoy being able to find songs that are not played on the radio any more, and to focus on my favorite singers.  The visual ads are not too annoying but the audio ones are."
44442,"Pandora",2017-08-20,5,"Pandora is a great get   I listen to Pandora practically everyday. I really like their feature allowing me to create stations around various genres and bands, so if a song pops into my head (and I know the band/singer doing it) I can create a station using that name and Pandora will play more of their stuff along with similar music from other artists. Great to have it playing in the background in my office while I'm working. Two thumbs and two big toes up."

It is rich with ""customizing"""
44462,"Pandora",2014-06-24,3,"???   The music is good, the thing is easy to use, there aren't too many radio interruptions, maybe three per hour.

It almost always picks mosaic I love from my seed songs and artists and I can't begin to tally the number of artists I discovered on Pandora.I've tried the copycat services, but they don't even begin to compare to Pandora. I believe the difference is that Pandora has humans do the categorizing rather than a computer. If you are serious about music --- it is the center of my life --- you must get Pandora AND sign up for the paid Pandora One subscription. Out is definitely worth the $35 of you listen even a fraction as much as ii do.Out is the only service I pay for other than Sirius, but that isn't really about tykes music."

My dogs like having it as well.I connect it to my stereo for a quick streaming experience.  I used to play it on my iPhone, but then used my fire so i won't need to disconnect every time i got a phone call.The main problem is that the app will stop playing when there is a Ad.  This happens less frwequently with PandoraOne, but still happens each 30 - 40 minutes.  A hassle since i need to turn off the app and then re-launch it.Not sure why this still not fixed."

If you want to hear all of your radio selections all you have to do is push the shuffle button and you can hear all the songs you want. Before I got the pandora app I was thinking, 'Is it one of those radios where you have stations like 98.7 and 95.5. Is it a kind of radio where you can't pick your songs, author or genre? Totell you the truth, you can choose your own genre, and author(s)put you can't pick the song. Pandora doesn't have station either, which I'm thankful for."

Everyone was singing along, dancing, laughing and really enjoying the day. The day was great thanks to Pandora !"
44601,"Pandora",2013-09-29,4,"Awesome, but ...........   I liked this app a lot. It is great for listening to music on a mobile device and it stays signed in to your account. My only problem with it is that it picks songs for you based on the station you create on it. You can't actually pick the song itself, so there are some songs you don't like on it. Pandora learns what you like and don't like by you giving the song a thumbs up or down. Overall, it's a great app. I would have given it 5 stars if you could pick the song!"

It will stop mid song and move on another, or it will just stop playing and you have exit and start again. I could tolerate it if these instances were few and far between, but they're not, and once they start happening they keep happening.That's not to say you shouldn't use it, because let's face it for free music listening it's pretty much your only option, but know that you are at some point going to be yelling at your phone over it."

44645,"Pandora",2012-11-29,3,"Update of Review - Kindle Fire HDX - 06/2014   Below, you will find my old review for how the App worked on my first gen Kindle Fire. With regards to my Kindle Fire HDX, I would say that performance and functionality have gotten a whole lot better. That said, my taste in music services has changed. I would recommend instead, either Songza or Spotify. Still, Pandora is a pretty solid offering and the app is several times better than it used to be.***Old Review 2012***This app used to be a good one on the Kindle. Now it plays two songs and just stops. Completely Useless. It's part of the reason why I don't subscribe to avoid having ads. Based on other reviews, they don't seem in a hurry to fix this, so why bother upgrading? Bad Business.Update (Same day): So after posting this review, I removed the app from my Kindle Fire and then re-downloaded it from the App Store. Now it appears to be working as it used too. So I've changed the rating to reflect this.Another Update (Same day): So it appears to play the songs without any problem, but when an ad pops up, the app just stops and you have to quit and relaunch to get it going again. So even a reinstall won't fix this. I'll reiterate as mentioned before, Bad Business!"

The more I express my likes and dislikes on each of my stations the better become the selections Pandora picks for me.

New artists or seldom heard artists are appreciated when they get your taste in music down and I have a quite a diverse taste in music, the tunes roll in."

44737,"Pandora",2015-11-07,4,"Good stuff   I love pandora, it's one of the greatest inventions ever. I get my favorite music with exposure to new, similar artists. The only con is the adds are annoying with the free version but it's to be expected."
44746,"Pandora",2013-02-19,3,"It's free... but the ads increased   I remember listening to Pandora and hearing an ad every 3 or 4 songs, now it seems as tho it's 2 songs, then an ad.  If I JUST had an ad, skip a song, it has an ad again.  Annoying, but, it's free.  As for the songs, I'm a fan of Industrial music and it seems as tho Pandora only plays songs by 6 or 7 different bands.  I KNOW there are more Industrial bands out there!  It serves it's purpose, it keeps my niece dancing on bad days, but the amount of ads is getting insane.  It isn't driving me to upgrade, it's driving me to find another service."
44747,"Pandora",2017-09-04,3,"Three Stars   Pandora is a good product, but in order to get the best quality, you must pay for use."

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the troubleshooting tips they suggest. Nothing works. Not sure if it's the app or its comparability with kindle fire so one star rating for now."
44755,"Pandora",2012-12-06,5,"always great app   You should have pandora on all of your devices. You never know when you will feel like certain tunes. I love listening to holiday music to get in the Christmas  spirit and I love listening to spa music to relax. love variety."
44756,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"Awesome Music Experience!!!   I upgraded to Pandora|One and I absolutely love it!!! Being able to choose both genre and style of music I want to listen to; and choosing songs that I don't want to hear again, is absolutely fantastic! It is well worth the monthly subscription fee, and not nearly as expensive as other internet radio options. I highly recommend this to any and all music lovers! You won't be disappointed!!!"
44763,"Pandora",2015-05-17,4,"Four Stars   Great music app."
44764,"Pandora",2013-05-09,5,"almost no commercial free radio   I love that I can ""create"" a radio station to MY taste in music, and not have to listen to a lot of the bull pucky crap they call music nowadays. GREAT app"

44785,"Pandora",2015-11-20,1,"Disappointed   So got this app a week ago and sarted it up and everything seemed to work as expected except that the music would not play and I couldn't pause or skip...very disappointed please fix! Would like to enjoy on my kindle."
44789,"Pandora",2015-05-14,4,"Pandora   Works well on data."
44799,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Works Well   I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"
44802,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"Immediately Able to Access My Music   App downloaded quickly and easily with authentic Pandora screen.  I could comfortably navigate the site as I would through my PC."
44803,"Pandora",2014-07-11,5,"Pandora is the wise old man of music streaming   I have been using Pandora since pretty close to when it first came out for PC.  I got Pandora one a few years later...back then it was one of the only apps that did music streaming in the way it does, but even with newer services available from other companies.  I still use Pandora . Love it"
44805,"Pandora",2014-05-20,3,"make the switch!   Switch to Spotify! You can download fave songs to listen while on the road/etc. without burning up data!! Internet radio is also an option and it is more interactive, ex. gives suggestions for different stations, singers, etc. in a fun visual way rather than boring old commercials. You have to upgrade to premium to download the songs but it is worth it!"
44806,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"Music......   ........that you have no control over. If you like Rock, Country, Electronica, Pop, etc, you pick the category and the songs begin to play. You cannot tell the app what songs you would like to hear. In other words, this works just like radio stations that plays genres of music that you like. You may not like the song that is currently playing, so you can switch to another station or just wait for the song to end and hope the next tune is something you like."
44810,"Pandora",2016-05-22,3,"Good. But not on the new Kindle Fire.   Couldn't get it to work on my new Kindle Fire. I really like Pandora and the amount of music you can listen to, but I'd be better off using my computer or phone t use it."
44812,"Pandora",2014-05-02,5,"Most Helpful   I started listening to Pandora years ago and they would not only play the songs by the artists I picked, they would point me to artists I had never even heard of which led me to buy their music and thus expand my music collection. I will keep on listening and hopefully hear about even more artists whose music needs to be heard."
44815,"Pandora",2015-09-20,3,"I love pandora but.....   When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."
44817,"Pandora",2016-09-03,4,"awwesome   i love pandora being able to listen to all of my favorite artist its awesome. i dont like how oi have to listen to the same commercials everytime i hear an advertisement its the same one over and over again"
44819,"Pandora",2014-01-09,5,"A music lovers dream app   This app is designed for the true music lover.  Works very well on Kindle Fire and is easy to set up.  You program the music you want by artist and Pandora takes it from there by providing that artist as well as like-sounding artist.  So you can discover other interesting artists you may not be familiar with or have heard their latest music."
44824,"Pandora",2012-12-31,5,"the best music app!   Pandora, choose your station. Customize the station. buy the music. share the song with a link. the lyrics can even be looked at on some songs. don't like the song, thumbs down. or you can move the song to somewhere else. i like the commercials. i have the free pandora. any station, clean, explicit. doesn't matter and pandora tells you if you are listening to the clean version of any song.music and comedy. something for every age. must have. i have this on my kindle fire. i find that this works very well indeed."
44832,"Pandora",2015-04-09,5,"... music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!   So many music apps out there but Pandora is far the best!!!"
44833,"Pandora",2014-04-19,4,"LOVE!!   It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!"
44834,"Pandora",2012-11-30,5,"Great music   Pandora has a great selection of music that can be listened to anywhere.  It also allows you to create your own stations and then scramble them to get a wide variety of music."
44835,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"Five Stars   Great!!"
44838,"Pandora",2016-05-16,4,"I like how is personalizes the stations   I like how is personalizes the stations, and I love thumbprint station, but I hate how it limits skips and dislikes one the free version. Also the adds are annoying."
44842,"Pandora",2016-12-18,5,"User friendly.   A real treasure. Wonderful selections that set the mood and allow the listener to get lost in the music."
44843,"Pandora",2017-11-09,5,"music lover   my favorite way to listen to music now."
44847,"Pandora",2014-02-28,4,"Great for the Most Part   You can't complain about the price, but I would like it so much better if you didn't choose other artists for me, or if you would at least allow me to weed them out.  The best I can do is drop 1 song at a time, and that just isn't adequate.  Most of the music you offer, however, is really great, so I gave you the 4 stars.Thank you."
44850,"Pandora",2017-04-05,4,"Four Stars   Great music!!"
44851,"Pandora",2017-02-10,5,"PANDORA   I really love it. I got Pandora for my husband and he is very happy with the music that he selected."
44854,"Pandora",2015-06-12,1,"Pandora couldn't fix the problem!   Pandora does not work any more on my Android phone.  I used their service for about 6 months then it stopped working.  I contacted them and they are unable to figure-out what is wrong.  I am cancelling my service and going with another provider."
44855,"Pandora",2014-02-16,1,"Pandora   I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password.  I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora.  Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod"
44856,"Pandora",2012-10-13,5,"Wonderful!   I always have and always will love the services Pandora provides. I get to listen to newer songs by the artists I adore and never have to pay a penny for it(unless I cannot live without the song in question)! And the way Pandora is set up for my Kindle Fire HD is far superior to the application on my iTouch. This version hardly ever freezes and does not deliver choppy music. I think there are far less bugs in this version. So, in short, great product that I use daily."
44863,"Pandora",2012-01-07,4,"great app, odd skipping problem   this app does its job: delivers the Pandora experience on kindle fire.  free tunes customized the say you like without having to micromanage your playlist.i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads,  but I really cant get upset about that for free music.  would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour.one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up.  hopefully they'll fix this with an update.  but for this, would give five stars."
44866,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"Awesome app   Love how you can add to or create a channel to fit your preferences."
44870,"Pandora",2016-01-08,2,"used to love it   I love this app and would love it more. But lately it won't play any station on my tablet regardless of the upgrades or not... I use the lullaby stations to help my son sleep at night plz fix"
44873,"Pandora",2013-05-23,3,"its okay   it keeps coming on by itself and I am not sure why. The song choices are not aways my favorite. I wish I had more control of that but it is nice to have music i don't have to buy."
44880,"Pandora",2014-06-20,5,"The pinnacle of relaxation.   This app provided me with a source of peace. I just set a time limit and zone out on the sofa. I love switching in between my selected genres without having to worry about being stuck with an unpleasant song. I can either skip it or dislike it. It is also great for when I'm doing other stuff. I just turn it on and put it off to the side whilst I work. I thoroughly enjoy this app."
44885,"Pandora",2017-08-08,5,"So such better than it used to be   Easier to use and the playlists I can actually listened to from beginning to the end"
44886,"Pandora",2012-09-25,5,"An Important App   There's a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none (Fix your device?)This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can't be rid of an entire artist, only a song.From what I've experienced, this is an app that must be had."
44889,"Pandora",2017-08-29,5,"😁   Excelente"
44891,"Pandora",2013-01-02,4,"Can never go wrong with a free music app   I have this on my both my internet TV and my tablet.  The music choices usually (but not always) stay true to the type of music played by the original artist you've chosen.  Surprised, though, that there is no choice for Beethoven or some of the other Classical greats, but it may be that my search capabilities aren't that great when searching for artists and music.  Even so, it's a great way to add the kind of music you like."
44895,"Pandora",2014-12-07,3,"grrrr why does it do this????!!!!!!   I love Pandora but... it keeps playing songs that don't even relate to me station I'm listening to! So I'm listening to Imagine Dragons raised and I hear Taylor Swift or Paul Cardall!!!! And it only lets me skip songs 5-6 Times an hour on each station!!! This is why I u, Pandora a 3-5!"
44896,"Pandora",2017-06-21,5,"Awsome app.   This app is awsone, it keeps track of your favorite music. Thumbprint is awesome and I also injoy shuffle.  Been listening to Pandora for over 5 years now."
44897,"Pandora",2012-12-26,4,"comes across songs/artist I have never heard of and I end up enjoying   I like that it lets me add several artists to one station so that it gets a better idea of what to suggest.  I don't like that in the beginning while you are ""teaching"" it what you like, you can only fast forward so many times.  And even though you can't go back and listen to a specific artist/album like in Spotify, it's suggestions are still much, much better.  So if I want something possible new mixed in with what I like I use Pandora."
44898,"Pandora",2013-12-15,5,"Love Pandora!   I listened for hours several days this week to the Christmas station, hearing wonderful songs, with some suggestions from me, while wrapping gifts and sitting by the fire. I love Pandora's varied choices for me. I am never bored, I often sing along, and if one they choose is not right for my mood at the moment, I can delete it and get another one immediately. The ads are few. And finally, its free!  What's not to like?"
44900,"Pandora",2017-10-13,3,"Three Stars   Needs the replay function added like the iOS version has. Other wise it’s as good as the iOS app"
44901,"Pandora",2017-05-29,4,"Four Stars   keeps me company and I enjoy their library of entertainjment"
44902,"Pandora",2013-06-30,4,"The best of the streaming music apps   I've used Google Play, Music 365, IHeart Radio and Pandora, and I have to give the overall nod to Pandora, even with the ads. If you're looking for stations that actually play the artists you want (assuming that they have a moderately  substantial catalog of at least 30 songs to their credit), you have to use Pandora. The best streaming music service online, and it's free if you don't mind the occasional 15 second ad."
44906,"Pandora",2014-12-03,5,"Work great on Blackberry Passport   Great app for fantastic music!!"
44907,"Pandora",2013-02-27,5,"Greatest thing since slice bread   The free appliction works great but a little crude for the Kindle, on the ipad it is fantastic.. I love it and bought a subscription to pandora."

44914,"Pandora",2017-09-12,5,"Like it a lot!!   Love being to choose the genres and artists that I like to hear.  Also like the ability to change song, if it's one I don't care for."
44916,"Pandora",2016-11-16,5,"Five Stars   It's on POINT!"
44917,"Pandora",2013-11-25,5,"Get this if you're a music lover.   This is a great service. I was slow to com to use this program. But this allows me to choose music I enjoy, especially right now, Christmas music.  Curiously, this version has only occasional ads. The smart  phone app is annoyingly riddled with ads--visual and voiced over. If I had first used that Pandora, I would never have loaded on my Kindle Fire. This is lovely and the ads are a minor annoyance."
44919,"Pandora",2016-05-10,2,"Not  a Happy Pandora customer   I tried numerous times to log in every time I put my birthday in and tried to insert the year it wouldn't let me scroll lower than 2002.Very frustrating"

44933,"Pandora",2015-04-15,4,"avd   Pandora is a great app it lets me pick the station I want to listen to and has great music but the only down side I see to this is that you need WiFi access but if it didn't needed WiFi it would be a good seller over all this is a great app : )"

I don't. get why people give this one star it's awesome cause when I put a band name it gives me the songs thar I want. Plus, when you want to just change it you don't have to get rid of the other radio, you could still keep it. The only thing that ticks me off is that commercials come up every 6 songs , but I'm still giving this app a 5 star rating. Don't ever listen to the people saying that it freezes or anything like that. So, get the app seriously, GET THE APP!!!!!!"

44966,"Pandora",2013-03-20,1,"I want my money back!   I loved Pandora. I use to listen to it when I went to bed. Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I took the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I looked Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?"
44968,"Pandora",2014-07-14,3,"okay, but...   Sure it plays some music you actually want to listen to, but everything else you don't want it to play comes in abundance! so please make it more careful! so many  artists I haven't even heard of pop up! I want it to stop!(please!)"
44975,"Pandora",2014-03-04,5,"Great Tribute of A wonderful variety of Music   It took awhile to figure out the ins and outs of operating this app but I do love it now and it was not hard to figure it all out. These Entertainers can really cut a rug on videos and albums but some of them need more experience to entertain live shows. Don't get me wrong but they need better instruments also and lots of ORIGINAL RIFFS to grab that Brass Ring.I wish all of our musicians  the very best..."
44978,"Pandora",2016-04-08,1,"Pandora not coming up   For some reason every time I try to open this app up it automatically shuts down. Tried reloading it several times still nothing. It has always perfectly up until today. I really like this app. What can I do to fix it?"
44981,"Pandora",2017-10-30,5,"Pandora   Works great and I love the music"
44985,"Pandora",2017-01-20,5,"Pretty necessary for your Fire   I'm a music junkie so this was a no brainer for an app to add to my Fire tablet. It gives me the variety between the Prime music and Pandora stations. I bluetooth the audio to a Motorola Sol speaker."
44986,"Pandora",2016-12-13,5,"but otherwise very pleased with the app   Sadly, my kindle doesn't have the same adblock features my laptop does, so I get the pandora ads, but otherwise very pleased with the app."
44990,"Pandora",2016-05-05,5,"Its popular and for good reason!   This app is easy to use and the only slight downside is that ypu have to pay for no ads and such but it's still very cheap, (7$ I believe, don't quote me) and is worth it.5/5"
44994,"Pandora",2013-12-22,5,"pandora is the ONLY station in our house and at work   we listen to pandora exclusively. just love being able to chose our music.whatever your mood, there is a station to match it."
44995,"Pandora",2016-02-13,5,"Mom approved   We use this all the time to find jams to party or sleep to, toddler approved. I especially love the rockabye channel, nice lullaby versions of green day, guns n roses, and Dr. Dre. Good times."
44999,"Pandora",2012-01-01,5,"Excellent performance on the Kindle Fire   I use the Pandora app daily and have been able to find whatever music genre I need to fit my mood or act as appropriate background music while reading.  Sound quality is excellent on the Fire, and the app has been almost glitch-free.  One feature I really like is the ability to link to Amazon's mp3 store for an item corresponding to what you're listening to (if you like what you're hearing and want to buy it).  Pandora provides amazing entertainment value on the Kindle Fire, and in my opinion has something to offer any user."
45000,"Pandora",2014-03-05,4,"Viola!   Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served.Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions (band name/song) that you give it. It's awesome, and super customizable. Best thing is it's a radio station. It's a different constant mix up.also, stick your phone/ tablet in a ceramic or metal bowl.""speakers"""
45008,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"It doesn't work anymore!!   I used to LOVE Pandora I used it all the time, but then my kindle had an issue and I had to restore it to factory settings. I got all my apps back, including Pandora, the app must have ""upgraded""(even though the setup, to me, looked like a five year old decided to move things around)I couldn't find anything at first(still don't know how to bookmark songs)but I got used to it. And then my Pandora started acting up, at first not very often it would just sit there after a song was done playing and it would just load, I would just go out of it and come back and it was fine, then that started becoming more frequent, and just now, I tried to go onto Pandora and every station I tried, Pandora just kept skipping all the songs, none of them would play they just kept coming on and then just skipped it, even the ads would be skipped. I tried deleting the app and put it back on, it would do the same thing. I deleted it and reinstalled it again 3 times, I tried everything, nothing would make it stop it just kept skipping all the songs. I am done with it, this is ridiculous, if it isn't fixed ASAP I'm just done with Pandora and I'm finding a new radio app."
45009,"Pandora",2015-06-16,4,"come on   I love it, and would give it 5 stars, but it has lags!!!!!! This one time, I couldn't log in for a day because of the lag! I finally deleted it and got it again. On the computer one, its really slow. I wish I could use it without wifi also. Otherwise, I love it!!!"
45010,"Pandora",2012-09-05,2,"Unsubscribed to Pandora One   Update:  I canceled my Pandora subscription after they raised the price.  Just not worth it to me anymore... Too expensive to get rid of the ads... I'd rather just listen to the free version and deal with the ads.Former:  I listen to Pandora every day.  In the car, at the office, at the gym... There is simply no other way to get this much music for so little money.  I force close every once in a while when I undock from the car or change power sources.  Otherwise it's perfect."

45015,"Pandora",2017-04-20,3,"Not working   Never had an issue before with this app. But now it is messing up. It plays maybe 5 seconds of a song and then the app just closes out. I have tried everything."
45032,"Pandora",2015-09-13,5,"Enjoy!   The app mirrors my smart phone and iPad apps which I thoroughly enjoy.  Being able to customize the apply for my listening tastes is excellent.  The free version does not have excessive advertisements.  Enjoy!  (PS:  Be mindful that the app uses data in the smart phone when used away from WiFi."
45033,"Pandora",2016-02-13,1,"Won't Play Music!   The app will not play music! It will play a single song, and then will stop playing. It wil show the next song, but won't let me hit play, skip, etc. I love Pandora, but will have to listen to music elsewhere if the app doesn't even work!"
45039,"Pandora",2013-07-15,5,"Music....   I have a couple of music downloads, and I perfer Pandora.  Free version still won't let you forward past songs as much as you'd like..."
45041,"Pandora",2014-07-14,5,"la la la!!!   I'm always listening to music at hhome so this is perfect because I don't have to buy any songs. or listen to the same songs over and over. So this is great because it has a huge variety of music!!! I recommend the:- ""Today's hits radio""- "" Dubstep radio""- "" Jasmine Thompson radio"""
45047,"Pandora",2012-05-31,3,"love pandora but app could use improvements   there are no technical issues with this app and I use it all the time on my Fire.  however, I don't like getting audio ads.  I don't get them when I listen his the web do why via an app?  also I am now getting tmobile ads in Spanish.  I don't listen to music in Spanish.  this is really really annoying.  additionally, I cant tweak my channels on the app like I can via the web.  please add this as a feature.  oh, please let me see songs I previously listened to like I can on the web."

45065,"Pandora",2013-09-27,5,"awesome, especially 4 older ppl -  grandchildren help too   Amazing, how music listening has evolved from reel to reel-4 and 8 track-cassette-cd; now i dont need drawers of storage space to find music I feel like listening too at the moment. Just pick a genre, (learn how to set up files or channels ? Will probably help too) get to hear music that I like, but never would have known it without Pandora choosing to play it based on my chosen genres."

45078,"Pandora",2011-11-16,2,"Ads suck and the interface is difficult with them running.   What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site."
45085,"Pandora",2017-11-01,5,"Awesome   Love it...people often ask me what music station I'm using... great choice"

45089,"Pandora",2017-08-21,5,"Five Stars   I enjoy listening to all the old classic music without having to download it"
45092,"Pandora",2015-02-09,3,"Ok...   It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."
45094,"Pandora",2017-09-08,5,"Five Stars   Great!:)"
45099,"Pandora",2017-10-24,5,"Five Stars   Im very satisfied with the items"
45102,"Pandora",2012-07-12,4,"Love it but...   Don't get me wrong I love the fact that they play great music for no price at all. Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for $ 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I don't want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up!:)"
45103,"Pandora",2013-09-25,2,"Fallacy of the Music Genome Project   The free version of Pandora plays music at 128K, which is only good for people who have very low standards in audio quality. Pandora One has 192K sound, but the quality is nowhere near iTunes Radio. The game is over for Pandora. Apple is choosing people who are pillars of music to choose their own playlists, and the lack of crappy songs that comes with Pandora is but a memory."
45104,"Pandora",2017-11-11,2,"Don't like new update!   I really loved Pandorea until today when I opened it and it was a totally different format. This format allows annoying ads to be on top of the song information where before ads were in the corner. My grandmas old phone had this format about ten years ago! I do not like the format and think it is harder to use. Please change it back!"

For a free product, Pandora does a fantastic job of allowing you to choose your favorite types of music and picking similar styles so as to let you hear a variety of music artists.  Once I choose my artist stations it also allows for a shuffling of stations. I believe I could listen for three days straight without hearing the exact same song.Pandora is a great site..............Everyone should take advantage of it."

45145,"Pandora",2013-02-26,4,"Pretty Good, One Problem.   This is a great app, and I love Pandora. It introduces me to new songs similar to the ones I like when I search for my favorite bands. However, one problem recently came up. When I open Pandora, and my Kindle Fire locks, it won't unlock. I've tried holding down the power button, but nothing works. As far as I've found, it only happens with this app. If this problem is fixed, it would be a perfect app."

45148,"Pandora",2012-01-13,4,"Pandora fan for years now   I was excited when Pandora became available for smartphones, and have been using it on my Android for a long time without any problems. Recently got a Kindle Fire and, again, it's great.Unfortunately, recently it has had the tendency to occasionally start a song and freeze and skip after about 20 seconds. Also, I understand the need for ads, but recently they've gotten a bit overnumerous and repetitive.But I love Pandora; it introduces you to new music, lets you customize your station based on the type of music you like, and the fact that you can now listen to Pandora without the 40-hour limit per month makes it only better.I only wish the ads were a little shorter, more varied, and maybe a little less often. Also, the slight buginess needs to be addressed. But still, a solid app, especially for fans of Pandora online just getting smartphones or tablets. Four stars, easily."
45158,"Pandora",2013-06-20,5,"My house has been redone by Pandora   Every time I paint a room, I've done it with Pandora blasting.  With the help of Bonnie Raitt, Dire Straits, Chris Williamson, the Bee Gees, Phil Ochs, Bruce, Joni, and every other beloved musician of my life I have redecorated each room in our newly purchased home.  The songs transformed our new home, new neighborhood, new community into wonderful old friends.  We are home."

Usually it gets stuck at a screen with Pandora title on a blue background screen, but nothing else.  I have to exit out, and try cycling thru the startup process several times before it lets me get to the point where I can play music. I don't use Pandora on my phone much because of this bug, and it drives me crazy because I love Pandora on my computer."

45223,"Pandora",2015-07-18,3,"Pretty good, could be better. I'll keep using it.   The ads and not letting you skip more than a couple songs are really irritating.

There is an occassional advertisement, and when it does come it only last 30 seconds at the most. Its free to listen to so yes of course your gonna need advertisements to pay the bills for Pandora.

45294,"Pandora",2012-12-06,4,"Great - thanks   I really like Pandora but it doesn't do the one thing that MySpace does - let you create your own playlists of just the songs you like as well as allowing you to choose a radio station. Sometimes I just want to listen to my own playlist."
45300,"Pandora",2017-05-30,3,"Three Stars   okay"
45304,"Pandora",2017-05-31,5,"Personalized listening.   What I like when I want it! It doesn't get any better than this!"
45305,"Pandora",2012-10-02,5,"Love the stations i can find on this app   i found some very funny comedy type channels and era specific ones that cater to my 80's hair band and late 70's self. mitch hedberg radio is friggin' funny! Great app!"
45316,"Pandora",2012-10-13,5,"O.M.G.   Pandora is Awesome! It is the best thing ever. You can access it from your mobil device and from you laptop or computer. O.M.G. Im like totally speechless.

45325,"Pandora",2012-12-20,3,"MEH   it needs to be fixed because it crashes everytime and it loads but nothing pops up its ok though its good sometimes:."
45327,"Pandora",2014-09-15,5,"Beta Then iHeart--CyTerraInfinite   This app has more relevant songs than iHeart, so then I won't hafta keep bouncing around from station to station like I hafta on iHeart. This also lowers the possibility of me coming across something that'll make me wanna hurl... Thank You Pandora!"

45333,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Wonderful Music   All kinds of music and classy stuff. Enjoy your favorite music, anytime you want. I listen to it all the time."

45336,"Pandora",2016-05-01,1,"Will Not Work   Pandora will no work on my 5th Generation Kindle which is my 3rd Kindle. Can anyone tell me why it won't work?"
45337,"Pandora",2014-12-19,1,"it sucks   I have had to redownload this app several times because of malfunctions with the app, and my kindle no longer works correctly. I don't recommend this app, although I still have to use it to record songs for videos I make. -_-"
45338,"Pandora",2013-05-01,5,"Just the best streaming music available   I use the paid subscription to Pandora, which as far as I am concerned is the best value around.  The take-it-with-you Android app works beautifully.My only quibble is that it's hard to change your shuffle on the app, but whatever.  It would be easier on a tablet, but for a mobile app, it's great.  Thanks, Pandora-you're the best."
45339,"Pandora",2017-06-08,5,"The songs are great!   Pandora play all the new songs that are out today and the ones I love"
45340,"Pandora",2013-02-04,5,"Wow   Love this app.  You can select so many different channels and create your own preferred listening stations.  Love love love it!"

45356,"Pandora",2017-06-16,5,"Five Stars   Enjoy it so much"
45361,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Loved having it on while I worked!   It came through just like from my computer, phone or TV. I love using it on my fire because it doesn't use data like my phone."
45362,"Pandora",2017-05-15,3,"Three Stars   Way too many commercials and auto fed songs not related to my specific artist."
45365,"Pandora",2017-06-13,1,"Difficulty signing up, did not get to try it out   Would not let me sign up, never got to try it out"
45367,"Pandora",2017-01-10,2,"Used to be a great app   What was once a great app starts to spiral downwards. The same music gets played again after an hour or 2. No variety in music anymore. When kindle screen goes dark the music stops. This has not happened before but now happens very frequently. Kindle needs to be on at all times for the app to play music."
45371,"Pandora",2015-07-26,4,"its nice just when you get it after like 3 or 2 days it starts loading forever but otherwise its really nice :)   I like it because if I'm running out of batteries then I can just shut my device off and it has a nice set up plus this should be for 8 yr Olds and up in my opinion :)"
45374,"Pandora",2016-07-26,5,"I love Pandora! I haven't purchased it   I love Pandora! I haven't purchased it ,so I do get commercials, but they aren't long. Any song you can think of if at your fingertips!"
45376,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"love pandora everywhere i go...   I have Pandora on my phone,  kindle and computer. I listen while reading, eating dinner and when working. if you have problems on your computer open a new engine ( mozilla or firefox) and only use fir Pandora. you wont ever get ""stuck "" or poor playback as others complained. I am going to the Bahamas soon and hope I can use Pandora there!"
45378,"Pandora",2017-01-26,4,"Four Stars   Turned out to be pretty good. Really learned my taste."
45380,"Pandora",2011-11-10,5,"Amazing   I have been using Pandora since 2006 and I love the service, I have their app on every electronic device I own that supports it, highly recomended. I wouldn't have music if it weren't for Pandora."
45382,"Pandora",2017-05-12,5,"Five Stars   I can listen to all my old and new favorite songs!!!!!"
45385,"Pandora",2017-04-29,3,"Too many ads   Cannot handle all the ads."
45387,"Pandora",2016-06-23,4,"Pretty good!   I wish it played more of the bands music on their station. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok"
45393,"Pandora",2013-05-09,5,"Awesome!   This app is amazing!!! I couldn't ask for better, why download costly songs when you can download a free app to listen to all your favorite songs without pay. That's pretty cool. The only bad thing is that you need Internet connection to use, and some of the songs are innapropriate. But otherwise...I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP (:"
45395,"Pandora",2017-08-01,4,"then I'd love this app   If Pandora didn't have so many commercials, then I'd love this app. But, Amazon Music is love for me. :)"
45398,"Pandora",2015-07-31,5,"pandora   it never works every time I try to download it just never works can u guys help me with this stuff please and how u can get the new songs kn their it just never works"
45399,"Pandora",2013-06-17,5,"Pandora   Pandora is the greatest invention since FM radio.  Rather than choosing a station based on what kind of music you like you now choose an artist you're in the mood to listen to and it never fails to satisfy. I love 80's hair bands for working out, jack Johnson for cooking, Chris daughtry for working and Abba by the pool."
45401,"Pandora",2015-06-19,5,"Awesome   This app enables me to listen to whatever I want to it rocks whoever doesn't like it is totally missing out on the fun it brings you on Friday night party's and random gigs!!"
45403,"Pandora",2012-07-20,5,"Pandora app   Pandora is an incredible app to purchase! You can listen to any type of music you'd like! There is rock pop rap hip hop Adele Gotye Katy Perry and every one else in music history! Want to listen to ""Somethin' 'bout a truck""  by Kip Moore? just click on Today's Country and it will be there! Pandora is awesome and a great app to get and its even free! Get it today!"
45406,"Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Five Stars   It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"

45413,"Pandora",2015-11-09,5,"Good Pandora app   Great app for pandora. I play it through a real set of speakers, so I get the full benefit."
45414,"Pandora",2012-05-18,1,"FAIL!   I used to love Pandora, but for the last several months I haven't been able to listen to an entire song. For a while it would only do this occasionally and so I put up with it. Now I'm lucky if I hear more than 30 seconds. I gave Pandora the benefit of the doubt and waited until the latest update... but still the same thing. I am uninstalling. Pandora has lost another customer."
45417,"Pandora",2015-12-30,5,"Good :)   Its a good app, but cant get it to where I can have my profile picture on it, does anybody know how? It shows the facebook thing but everytime I log in it still wont let me"
45423,"Pandora",2015-03-01,5,"Of course its great for all the other artists   find it very convenient!  Our daughter is into dance, tap and ballet.  We grew up with Irish Step dancing.  With no Irish music on hand----------POW! lets try Pandora! That's all we needed at the time.  Of course its great for all the other artists."
45424,"Pandora",2012-05-30,5,"Amazing!!   this is by far the best radio station app ever. love it! you can create multiple stations and listen to the seperately or go on quick mix.And for those of you who are rating this 1 star because of the adds, you do realize they have to pay to run this somehow. if you hate the adds so much, then pay the whole dollar a month to not have adds. this app is fantastic!"
45428,"Pandora",2013-03-12,4,"Nice application   If it weren't for the commercials I would have given 5 stars. I like that there are so many different stations to choose from. And the options to skip a song if you don't want to listen to it is nice. Also the thumbs up and thumbs down option is great. Especially when you don't like a song so it won't choose it at random later."
45432,"Pandora",2013-06-13,5,"Its good times...whar more can you say!   As a past subscriber to XM Radio I was looking for a substitute for less cost.  XM is just too much money unless you travel alot.  Pandora fills the spot nicely.  Its good on travel too if you have good internet service in your area of travel.  I have not tried their premium service, but I am thinking about it."
45434,"Pandora",2016-10-24,5,"Five Stars   Makes our workday go smoothly!"
45435,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Pandora is my favorite app out there.   I've loved the Pandora radio for as long as it's been available. I would leave everything on my phone and just keep Pandora and be happy!"
45438,"Pandora",2016-12-29,4,"I like that I was able to transfer all the stations ...   I like that I was able to transfer all the stations from another deviceja to a new one with Amazon."
45439,"Pandora",2016-03-23,3,"Will Not Download!!   After awhile I deleted it then when I tried to download it again It said Preparing Download for 2 days"
45440,"Pandora",2014-11-07,5,"Just the music I want to hear, when I ...   Just the music I want to hear, when I wish to hear it, in a manner I want to hear it, on the device I choose to. What more could a music lover ask for? I'm thinking… I'll have an answer for this next selection."
45442,"Pandora",2017-11-11,4,"Pandora One is Great, Pandora Basic .. Not   Pandora One is the way 2Go"
45446,"Pandora",2011-12-16,5,"Pandora-the best   I have found Pandora the most veratile and dependable of all the music suppliers. I use it on my ethernet connected TV, my PC, my Android X2 and my Kindle. Artists available are most all that I have looked for. Plus you can buy a song or an album if you like. Their variety of artists used has introduced me to new groups that I otherwise might not have heard. A very well thought out program."
45451,"Pandora",2017-04-20,5,"Five Stars   All the music I could want!"
45455,"Pandora",2012-10-09,4,"great /failing   I just got this app and I'm in love with maroon 5 the script neon trees and any other alternate band ...but sadly it just cut off and said ' sorry app has forclosed' or ' we are unable to play any more music under this station.  please change stations' if this doesn't Starr to work in the next day ..DELETE! its a waiste if thatsvall its gonna do"
45460,"Pandora",2016-02-02,4,"gospel   need. too listing for my mind body and soul and pray read my Bible every dayand I love it so should you"
45470,"Pandora",2017-01-18,5,"Five Stars   Super. I love all the songs in my chosen category. Hope you have one in the philippines!!!"
45478,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Great Selection   Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."
45480,"Pandora",2016-03-06,3,"But not nearly as good as   Can't pick specific songs ...  Volume is inconsistent... OK ... But not nearly as good as Spotify"
45484,"Pandora",2014-01-07,5,"Love it   I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want.  I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I'm in for the day.  I have my workout music on one station and I don't have to worry about skipping thru the songs."
45488,"Pandora",2013-08-07,3,"stop with the ads   Pandora free is good until the commercials get in there. I just had, literally not joking, a Dyson commercial pop up every time I skipped a song. I skipped six songs in a row and what do you know a 30 second Dyson commercial every time I skipped. I saw that commercial at least six times."
45489,"Pandora",2012-01-12,5,"Can't understand.   I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."
45492,"Pandora",2012-09-07,5,"Now better than I Heart Radio   Pandora was a pain, so was using I Heart. Since the update, so much better. Easier to navigate, lists the lyrics, love the selection of stations and music. Created a station I love. But if you are looking for more eclectic artists and to discover new tunes, stick with I Heart. Also love if there's a song I hate,I never have to hear it again."
45493,"Pandora",2012-10-08,5,"Excellence in Every Way!   The absolutely best music service available.  I am introduced to new music based on my preferences and also hear my favorites from a variety of genres.  Very little repetition through the week and somehow the algorithm they use manages to intuit what type of music I might like at night or on a weekend vs. mid-week.  I just love Pandora!"
45498,"Pandora",2013-06-10,5,"Lexi(:   Being one that is very picky when it comes to music providers, I surprisingly loved Pandora. They have every variety of music genres. The only thing I do not like is your limited on songs you can skip and you have to pay in order to not have advertisements. But they have to make money some way."
45508,"Pandora",2013-10-02,5,"Music   Gotta love Pandora.  So fun to gave music when and where ever you want . The commercials aren't terrible either"
45515,"Pandora",2015-09-02,1,"not in Canada   Unfortunately after installing a popup appears on launch stating the service is not available in my country (Canada).  C'est la vie."
45519,"Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"Pandora   I can play the artist I like.  Being a 1940s' guy I can get the big band music I enjoy and the vocalist of the 40s' singing music that you can actually understand."
45521,"Pandora",2014-06-02,5,"sweat   I love Pandora I think its a very very cool and you will love this app on the app store.,....................................................!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
45524,"Pandora",2014-09-08,1,"ANOTHER APP NOT COMPATIBLE W/FIRE TV   Another app not compatible with FIRE TV, this is getting old.  Why oh why is NOTHING cool compatible with FIRE TV????"
45526,"Pandora",2013-08-08,3,"keeps crashing   I love this app! in fact i listen to Pandora on my computer as well, however this app has been crashing alot lately! It will just stop when i'm listening or will say it had an error and needs to close. Hopefully the next update will fix this. I am using this app on my HTC Rhyme"
45531,"Pandora",2016-02-20,5,"Fantastic   I love that I can listen to the genre of music I like. The songs are tailored to my favorite artists."
45533,"Pandora",2015-02-22,5,"amazing app   every on if u read this then u know that this is a good app because it gives u free music to listen to on the road or just in your house with free music when ever u want"
45534,"Pandora",2016-12-07,5,"Pandora rules   Amazing source for music"
45540,"Pandora",2014-05-12,4,"anyway a good app to relax and be happy because you can listen all types music   is a great app for adults and kids to listen all types of music but the only problem is that when you want to change from radio station stock and you cant changed and have to wait until done the last song that you listening"
45542,"Pandora",2016-12-26,5,"All venues comedy, holiday, pop, gospel   best variety of music comedy even some podcasts. I have been a fan of Pandora radio for years never gets old, love it! 😜"
45555,"Pandora",2016-02-13,4,"pretty good   I guess it is ok but if you are hoping for a really good music app go to iheartradio"
45557,"Pandora",2015-08-12,4,"stupid comments   it dosent let me make comments after a sertain amount and i hate that it is soooo stupid.how comunicate with my friends?????"
45558,"Pandora",2014-11-12,5,"free!!!!!!   love this app it lets you ""sing along"" to pretty much anything. also saves your fav type of music.LOVE IT!!!!  so I totally recomened for every one to get this FREE app."
45560,"Pandora",2014-10-22,5,"best music ever   pandora is great to play all my fav music. It could be better by while playing the music it you can see the music videos. I'm not a great fan of IHeart because it keep cutting me out."
45573,"Pandora",2012-11-06,5,"What else is there to say? Pandora is fantastic   This delivers music with very little ads. But music that YOU pick, you ""like"" and you might not yet know, but may grow to love. It's free content for the cost of listen to an ad or two every five or six songs and REALLY free if you use it over wi-fi and not on your limited data plan smart phone. So much fun!"
45574,"Pandora",2016-12-14,4,"I love not having to listen to commercials   I love not having to listen to commercials, skipping all the music I don't want to listen to. This is a good deal."
45575,"Pandora",2012-06-03,5,"da best   Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music!  you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like,  I love it && I'm positive u will too :)"
45576,"Pandora",2012-03-07,5,"Dunno why you hatin.   I dunno why everyone here is saying it sucks on the kindle fire. Its awesome on the KF and the music comes out very clearly and smoothly. I've never had to deal with a force close with Pandora and although commercials do occur they are not as constant as many people lead first-time Pandora users to believe. Do not fall to the lies children!!!"
45577,"Pandora",2013-09-04,4,"Love the variety!   After adding artists I can listen to many different genres of music....and so like the feature that tells me why they chose a particular song, or how it is like the music of the artists I have selected"
45578,"Pandora",2012-11-16,4,"Could be a little better   The android app doesn't let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I don't like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!"
45579,"Pandora",2017-01-03,1,"One Star   It doesn't work"
45582,"Pandora",2012-04-15,5,"AMAZING!!!!!   Pandora is so much better than the iheart radio app. it is simple. fun. and when I want to makemy own radio all i have to do is type one song that I like and then it is like it reads my mind because it gives me all of my fav. songs. amazing. if you have a doubt about buying this app don't. it is totally worth it. makes me feel so good."
45583,"Pandora",2017-01-23,5,"Five Stars   LOVE it."
45584,"Pandora",2013-01-08,4,"love it   I love this app. it can get a little glitchy at times but for the most part runs smoothly. if I do have trouble with a station I just switch the station or restart the app. its a great companion for when I get bored of the music I have. nice way to learn of new artists. I definitely reccomend it."
45586,"Pandora",2014-09-03,5,"amazing   I think that this is a great app I have it on all of my electronics and it has all different types of music for all different types of people I love this app and I think you should get it."
45589,"Pandora",2017-01-25,5,"Five Stars   love it"

45608,"Pandora",2013-12-05,5,"excellent   this app is the best.  Just put in a song you like and it will play that song & songs similar to it.  You can create lots of stations - pick some of their own/hardly Any commercials - just a very cool way to rock out to tunes.  Love it"
45612,"Pandora",2014-06-10,5,"Great Music Choices   I downloaded this application for my Kindle to play while I'm at work.  There's such a broad range of different music specifically for my taste.  The songs play more clearly than my radio in work which tends to fade in and out because of being in a high office building.  I would recommend this application to people of all ages."
45614,"Pandora",2016-11-25,5,"Five Stars   Is good"
45621,"Pandora",2016-03-16,1,"Doesn't Work   Doesn't play. Just shows song information. Very disappointing."
45624,"Pandora",2012-10-12,5,"music discovery   Pandora has been my number one app since my first smart phone.  I have discovered so much new music with this service.  I can listen on my computer, on my Roku, on my phone, and on my Kindle Fire HD.  I've been a Pandora One subscriber for the last two years and it is the best $30 I spend each year."
45625,"Pandora",2013-05-31,5,"DON'T HATE PANDORA   Pandora is nice way to bye the time away while your waiting. Plus its free music, youcan listen to almost anywhere, and yup can listen any song you want. I reccomend this because theirs music you could share with your family and more.Hope you like it."
45628,"Pandora",2015-03-18,3,"Why?   I would give this five stars but if I type in the name of a song it would be nice to hear that song or at least songs by the same musicians."
45636,"Pandora",2013-04-13,4,"time limit too short, otherwise an awesome app   There is a 40 hour limit to listening to the music on this app. I ran out of time in 3 days. I don't want to pay to upgrade so I'm stuck. That's the bad news  the good news is that Pandora plays music that os completely tailored to me!!! This is one of my favorite apps"
45640,"Pandora",2013-12-26,4,"4 star royal review   I got this app because I always use Pandora on my other devises when I am useong that device some of my kids use it. I do like this app i only gave it 4 stars because it is kinda hard to navigate this app on the Kindel Fire."
45643,"Pandora",2012-05-19,5,"perfect for Pandora lovers like myself   I love the Pandora service, whenever I can I'm listening to Pandora One, it provides me with the music I like that I cant find anywhere else and provides a constant tune to my life.  I have discovered many fantastic artists and listened to well over 2000 hours, thanks Pandora for providing such an amazing service :)"
45646,"Pandora",2017-08-05,4,"Four Stars   Good."
45648,"Pandora",2012-09-19,2,"WHY THE CHANGE???   I have been a Pandora fan for quite a while and I absolutely hats their new format. That is why I have given it a 2 star rating. It plays fine on the Kindle Fire. I just can't access my favorites or anything. Will be finding me another radio channel until Pandora gets this crape straightened out."
45650,"Pandora",2017-04-28,5,"Pandora still on SONY DASH   Listen to it every day. Use the genres feature and listen to NEW AGE BEATS on my obsolete SONY DASH!"
45656,"Pandora",2015-03-02,1,"CRAP   This radio is a piece of crap I have a email account and poopdora wouldn't let me play I would give it negative infinity stars if I could"
45658,"Pandora",2011-12-21,5,"Pandora is an awesome application!   Pandora is the best of the radio applications.  It is free and works very well, even in the car!Anyone I have shown this application to has been very impressed and installed it immediately.  Congratulations on a job well done to the makers of Pandora.  As a reward, I signed up for Pandora One.  Look into it.  You won't be sorry."
45661,"Pandora",2013-08-25,1,"Didnt Work   I downloaded this app for my kindle fire. When I opened it nothing happened. I tried deleting it and re-downloading it - it still did not work. It just shows the opening Pandora screen and never does anything else. Just a tad bit annoying!"
45663,"Pandora",2016-07-11,1,"One Star   Same old stuff all the time"
45666,"Pandora",2017-05-17,1,"One Star   Not sure how this popped up on my list,  Cleared it out."
45668,"Pandora",2013-03-07,4,"I love pandora but...   I have been using Pandora for months to listen to music at work. I didn't care that there were advertisements since it was free. Now they are limiting the free music to 40 hours per month. I will find a new app for listening to music at work. I'm very disappointed."
45671,"Pandora",2017-04-05,5,"love it!   listen all the time ,prefer music with no words, love it !!!"
45672,"Pandora",2012-09-30,5,"I love this app!   I love listening to this while I work in the kitchen or am just hanging out. I've also discovered some new artists that I've never heard of before due to the stations playing similar music to artists I already like. I highly recommend. There are commercials, but not too often. Thumbs up."
45675,"Pandora",2015-12-22,5,"love it   I love this app it just plays songs without you having to select one"
45678,"Pandora",2016-06-24,5,"It's great   I use it daily  I love it."
45679,"Pandora",2012-11-19,5,"Listen to it ...Love it   LOVE Pandora.  It is a great way to hear your favorite artists but also learn about new artists and tracks that are very similar.  I listen to it when I work out...my favorite station is Pit Bull.  And when I am in the bath...favorite station is 2 Chellos. It rocks!  Literally."
45681,"Pandora",2012-12-10,1,"Adds freeze kindle   I loved this app until recently. the video advertisements freeze the app if you aren't actually on the app. think they are trying to make you physically watch the commercials. happens all too often for a person who works with their hands constantly. iheartradio hear I come."
45682,"Pandora",2013-08-12,5,"Music for ME   It is so wonderful to listen to music I love, the words I can hear and even sing along.....the best part I choose the music and it is there for me....always.  I have heard songs that I have not heard in YEARS!!!  The best part it is FREE!!!!"
45684,"Pandora",2014-09-04,4,"great   great way to enjoy personalized music.  you pick what you like and don't like and it customizes itself to you like a well tailored outfit.  nothing can beat this."
45689,"Pandora",2017-09-16,2,"Confusing, for me!   I thought it was a radio station, can't navigate it at all."
45695,"Pandora",2013-04-26,4,"meh   I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me"
45699,"Pandora",2013-04-29,4,"Great App   I like this app and the music you can listen too.  Once you've chosen your genre, it will keep suggestions and songs coming.  I do wish Kindle had a better speaker but the sound is not bad and you can listen to your songs without disturbing others."
45702,"Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Amazing   I think this is the best way to listen to music. You could have all the songs you want but on phones people by there favorite music when you can get it free right on Pandora. In my opinion I think it's amazing!"
45703,"Pandora",2016-01-17,2,"Sucks no volume   Does not play at all on kindle 10 fire do not waste time"
45704,"Pandora",2012-12-07,5,"Love it! :)   This app is an amazing app! I love! When I do my homework this is an awesome app because I cant live without music. When music is on, while I'm doing my homework it takes a half hour. And without music it takes me an hour. But I love to dance to it to. I LOVE MUSIC! :)"
45707,"Pandora",2012-09-09,3,"sorry people who like this app   well I'm a huge owl city fan and Taylor swift but when I got those Radios it would be songs like spongebob(I'm not lying )and stuff.I mean spongebob rocks but has nothing to do with Taylor Swift or Owl City.But other then not putting the right songs on the stations it was a ok app."
45708,"Pandora",2015-07-21,5,"I like it because I can chose what music I want ...   I like it because I can chose what music I want to hear.  They seem to have all kinds of music."
45711,"Pandora",2012-12-01,2,"loved it till recently. plays one song and freezes. i have to quit (close app) and reopen....just to hear one song and Repeat!   Frustrated that it only screws up on my kindle fire. Pc works fine. I love listening to music almost 24/7 but its annoying when you have to stop whatever you are doing and go close and reopen the app every few seconds. Hopefully I.T. is already working on the solution."
45718,"Pandora",2014-01-08,5,"GREAT   I like background music and can't stand ads.  By using this app I can select the kind of music I like or in the mood for and turn it up. The adds on the free app are short and don't come on very often."
45720,"Pandora",2013-06-24,5,"Music,Music!!!   I love this app. I can hear all the music I want all the time. I put in an artist  and there is the music. I am in love with this app. Being as it's free, you have a lot of ads, but that's ok with me, because it doesn't stop the music."
45723,"Pandora",2012-12-05,2,"doesnt make sense   I was listening to a station while doing my homework and skipped a song and the previous song wad still playing. so know I was stuck listening to a song that I don't want. and also every time I skip a song, the same spainish ad came on..ready to delete next screw up"
45727,"Pandora",2015-04-04,5,"this is awesome!!!!!!!!   this app has all the songs I love for example; lord!!!!!:)I love all of these songs like lords!!!!! :)"
45730,"Pandora",2015-02-14,5,"awsome app   it is awesome for when I have to clean my room. I just turn on my kindle and poof. music. it help me clean spittle faster"
45734,"Pandora",2015-04-06,5,"AWESOME   If you love music you should get Pandora. I love Pandora you should get it. You will love it. BEST THING EVER!!!"
45736,"Pandora",2012-12-27,5,"Spend a few dollars and get commercial free!   Love Pandora! I splurged and spend the extra $9.95 to get rid of the commercials and it was a very satisfying move! Love having the extra music to play. I have a large music library but I am always finding new artists on Pandora that I would never have heard."
45737,"Pandora",2015-08-07,4,"what happened?   Pandora was awesome on my Kindle Fire...until yesterday. Still plays great on my iPhone but sucks on Kindle!! Please fix, I beg you."
45743,"Pandora",2017-08-15,1,"One Star   I can't get into it."
45746,"Pandora",2015-03-31,4,"Good app   Does what I want it to do and more. I have had no problems with it so far and look forward to using it often."
45747,"Pandora",2013-07-27,5,"good   you'll love it. the only let down is that you need wifi for it to work. I use it a lot so its nice that they made it portable . I feel that if they tried a little harder, they could make so that you wouldn't need internet."
45749,"Pandora",2016-03-28,5,"Incredibly diverse music library, everywhere you are, for a pittance!   I must have music as much as I need to breathe.  At home, at work, in the car, while I do chores inside/outside, read a book, shower, go to sleep.  No time for collecting a library, Pandora can do it for me and let me modify to near perfection."
45755,"Pandora",2012-01-02,3,"no more songs?   This has recently happened; I listen to Pandora constantly, it's really great and has introduced me to a lot of new songs and artist, but now, everytime I listen to a particular station, it says no more songs can be played/found. I haven't had this issue before. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?"
45758,"Pandora",2017-09-07,5,"Five Stars   It is awesome!"
45770,"Pandora",2014-10-16,3,"Not so grand   Yes,  it worked well for a month.  Now,  it crashes everytime I use it!  Also, the song selections at times, leave a little to be desired."
45773,"Pandora",2016-02-28,4,"Four Stars   All my favorite music.  I like it."
45775,"Pandora",2015-04-10,5,"Love it   Pandora is fabulous.  You can put in any artist or song and it will play that genre of music.  It can take a twist and go more country or rock so you have to click thumbs up or down to keep it on track but over all you can enjoy good music for a long time."
45777,"Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"Five Stars   It's great"
45778,"Pandora",2015-11-12,5,"Five Stars   great"
45779,"Pandora",2016-01-11,5,"Lol Awesome app! BETTER THAN SPOTIFY &_&   No seriously better than SPOTIFY &_&"
45781,"Pandora",2013-08-18,1,"refresh-ing   Had to refresh after every song. Very frustrating! Don't think it was my fault either, if it was my Droid, shame on Pandora for having such a bad app."
45783,"Pandora",2015-04-18,5,"ross   if I get to get Pandora I will get all kinds of my favorite songs and I will always listen to pandora"
45787,"Pandora",2012-03-20,4,"Good App   Good app to help you find artists and songs that are similar to ones that you already know and like. Type in an artist and Pandora will play songs from them and others in the same gendre. The only complaint is the ads, and not being able to skip songs as much as I would like to sometimes."
45791,"Pandora",2014-01-11,5,"great music   I like 90-95% of the music I hear, I think it's great, keep playing the good stuff. I really don't mind the commercialsbecause they allow you to get up and get a drink or something."
45794,"Pandora",2013-08-21,3,"love it but....   This app is great I used to use it every night but in the morning it take w or e minutes to shut it off. first you have to push the still listening then when the music starts AGAIN you have to shut off the add then you have to go to your channel. list and click the button to open the menu to shut it off. and its all deliberate so you will buy the pay service. No thanks I'll. just use something else."
45796,"Pandora",2017-10-09,1,"One Star   Can't get good songs"
45798,"Pandora",2015-07-15,5,"I FREAKIN LOVE IT   This app gives you the opportunity to listen to free music. Plus you can listen to any artist. YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET THE BEST APP EVER PANDORA!And you can play minecraft with pandora. LoL I'm even listening to pandora as I write this."

45809,"Pandora",2012-12-09,1,"horrid   no longer do I wish to waste my time with this ixmpecible app. as a music app critic, I have heard and used every app for music known. in all of my career this has been one of the most repolsive. no sound ever çame even with the volume on Max. I was declined of severally stations and the same song plays every ten minutes. if u r looking for an app worth the time, continue ur search by pressing back and scrolling to other options"
45816,"Pandora",2012-12-13,3,"It's OK   Like the stars say it's okay but it really makes me mad when in the middle of a REALLY good song and it crashes. Now I used too use Pandora EVERYDAY but now it gets on my nerves... I'm think about a different music app... It TRUELY is a shame..."
45819,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"Pandora rocks   I love being in charge of my music choices. I get to hear all sorts of new stuff too."

45836,"Pandora",2013-06-03,1,"40 Hour Listening Cap- ARE YOU CRAZY?????   I used to LOVE Pandora!  Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW.  For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month.  Are you for real??  With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU $3.99???  Take a powder, Pandora!I started using RADITAZ, people!!!  Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour.  Even has a carosel for songs.  So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio (free version).  Pandora must be INSANE!!"
45838,"Pandora",2014-12-30,5,"So easy   I think Pandora is great it has all types of music and is enjoyable and its endless you can use it all the time"

45850,"Pandora",2012-12-30,4,"Good but....   I have been using Pandora since I downloaded on my kindle fire & it does have good quality of music when it wants to play. It seems it recently has been fixed. hopefully no interruptions will occur again. I hate it when it forcloses."
45852,"Pandora",2014-04-21,4,"ehh   pandora is great but it has problems just like every other game. it it hard to get back into once you uninstall it from where ever. GET IT PEOPLE GET IT!!!!!"

45863,"Pandora",2016-02-03,5,"review   Pandora is an amazing app"
45866,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"i love it   ilove it it has great songs and you can look up what ever station you want and you can skip songs it is basically like your ipod but you don't have to pay for the songs"
45868,"Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best online music with a great app   There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version.  This app allows for both but if you don't have a subscription then expect commercials and popups.  The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
45871,"Pandora",2014-03-30,5,"One of the best apps ever.   I love music, so I decided to download this app. Not only has it allowed me to find different artists, but form a radio around them that I enjoy. The ads may be annoying, but you can update to premium, or just deal with the ads. Either way, it's still one of the best apps ever. Definitely recommend you getting this. Why not? It's free!"
45873,"Pandora",2013-05-05,5,"AWESOME!!   My friend downloaded Pandora and she loves it. Whenever I come over to her house we always listen to it. There are so many stations and songs to pick from. Definatly buy this app. Totally worth it. I reccomend this."
45874,"Pandora",2013-12-20,5,"its the best music app ever.   don't waste your money on some other music app its no mathch for this app.  its free also instead of paying"
45876,"Pandora",2012-10-22,5,"great music app!   this is a app I use everyday when I work out or just wanna listen to some good music. I like how you can listen to millions of songs without even touching your tablet it will find songs for you! its a great and handy app I highly recommend it."
45877,"Pandora",2012-12-02,5,"awesome music radio   Pandora is the best music radio. you can listen to music whenever and whatever music you want to listen to. make up your own radio station and its awesome listen to all your favorite music. for those of you who love music get Pandora!!!!"
45880,"Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Forget broadcast radio   Pick a fav artist or song and build your stations.  Very few commercials on free version. Been using for years...no complaints. Almost as good as XM .Add some adult talk stations, like Opie & Anthony. Then 4 stars gets 5 stars."
45885,"Pandora",2014-10-26,5,"just right   You can pick any station. If you're bored you can chose any tile of music you like. When it's Sunday I turn on hymns."
45886,"Pandora",2011-10-24,3,"song choices are great.  Ads  played over the songs are not   I dont mind the station having ads but playing over the top of the songs is very annoying.  The old method of playing the ad in between the songs made much more sense.  Maybe it is a glitch but I dont really understand what the ad is saying with the song still playing in the background."
45887,"Pandora",2014-10-09,5,"fun music   I LOVE THE PANDORA MUSIC THATS WHY I USE THIS APP THE END what no DON'T GO RIGHT NOW OKAY NOW YOU CAN GO THE END FINNALY"

45895,"Pandora",2011-12-25,4,"Pandora's view   Pandora has been a companion for over nine months now, and I love it! It gives variety, and spice to life, from something to listen to while getting ready for work in the morning or working out in the gym. The latest to oldest music you can get your hands on. Thank you Pandora."
45898,"Pandora",2013-02-12,3,"for kindle   This version of Pandora is really different. The music stops playing after two songs because it wants to see if I'm still listening; and my favorite stations are hard to get to now. They should have left it the way it was."
45902,"Pandora",2017-09-11,5,"Five Stars   Great product listen daily."
45903,"Pandora",2013-08-21,2,"pabdora sux   Pandora was ok when u were able 2 skip 6 times every hour but now they skimp u on skips and the lame comercials every othe song. I jst download my own music and not have 2 worry bout using it"

45918,"Pandora",2013-05-18,5,"A PIECE OF HEAVEN   No.matter what your mood, choose a station and transcend your every day concerns and pressures. Purchase the Pandora One option. It is WELL worth it. No, I DON'T have any affiliation or connection with Pandora!"
45920,"Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"Good app.   Pretty good app, works well on my device. I took one point off because it tends to play the same artist too often even when I add plenty of other artists to a station (with the artist in question being excluded from the list)."
45921,"Pandora",2015-11-21,5,"LOVE IT. My favorite GO TO   LOVE IT.  My favorite GO TO!!!!!"

45935,"Pandora",2017-06-30,5,"Awesome. I luv it!!!!!   I luv pandora so much!!!! Thumbs up and thumbs down r cool.  And being able to skip songs u dont like is great.  Pandora Premium is totally awesome with full albums of music  and playlists.  Five stars"

I was VERY HAPPY to see the icon the other day.  Sound quality is great and I haven't had any issues with freezing as of yet."
45957,"Pandora",2014-11-08,1,"not what i want   I couldn't find any thing I searched on there. If it found something, it was totally not what I wanting"
45960,"Pandora",2017-05-29,5,"Five Stars   Fantastic"
45962,"Pandora",2013-09-05,5,"as expected   Pandora keeps things simple and straight forward. It provides music to me at the low cost of one commercial every 15 minutes or so. A better deal than regular radio if you ask me."
45963,"Pandora",2017-11-09,1,"One Star   cant get it to work"
45965,"Pandora",2016-03-29,4,"It will play music that you probably like. I've had issues with glitching and general misbehavior ...   It will play music that you probably like. I've had issues with glitching and general misbehavior from the Pandora apps, but right now I think it's in a solid, usable state."

45978,"Pandora",2013-08-09,5,"Creating my own radio station!   Now I can listen to music without interruption and select my own genre of music, artists, etc.  It's best than downloading itunes into my iPhone and then having to use up my battery"
45979,"Pandora",2013-12-29,5,"Fun to listen to!!   I enjoy Pandora because it picks songs from a genre that I choose. I can also rate the song so it will either play it again in the future or not.  It's fun!!"
45982,"Pandora",2015-01-01,1,"This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's)   I am using it on my Black Berry.  The app I had (Apollo) stop working and of course, Black Berry doesn't have another.  No surprise, don't ask.  This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's).  It is not clear, actually has static over the channel and hard to navigate.  I will keep it because I love Pandora but, continue to look for an alternative."
45990,"Pandora",2014-03-30,5,"Great Game   I love this app. You may not listen to the exact song you want but its a way to listen to music u like. It surprises me that its even free."
45997,"Pandora",2012-11-17,5,"Music made easy   I enjoy listening to new music and Pandora has introduced me to many of my favorite bands. It's definitely worth downloading. Paying for the subscription makes it even better and helps out one of my favorite companies."
45998,"Pandora",2012-12-11,4,"better than others   this app has almost all the music in the world. and some apps are realy bad and u have to pay for it.on my kindle u get commercials every 7 songs or something like that and they are only 30 seconds most of the time"

46017,"Pandora",2013-04-05,3,"it used to be a 5 star   at first, I thought this app was the best thing ever, especially to listen to k-pop, but then I updated it and now I can't listen to it none stop unless I pay or be limited for every month. I wish I didn't update and am warning you not to, too."
46021,"Pandora",2013-05-26,5,"Great app!   I love this app! I will turn it on when ever i want to listen to music!! The only problem is occasionally it will like skip and pause and stuff when my kindle is doing too much at once."
46027,"Pandora",2012-09-25,5,"Easy listening   Very easy to use, love the organization. Very easy and quick app. Its is very easy to transfer all the information from your kinddle to your comp, although the interface is easy to use, i feel the look should be updated."

46042,"Pandora",2013-08-09,5,"Music & Comedy   I enjoy Pandora. It lets you listen to a wide range of music and even stand up comedies by different comedians. The only thing I dislike is the ads but there aren't many."
46045,"Pandora",2013-04-27,2,"Dont Update Pandora   Pandora was the best thing until I had to start paying the monthly fee. It used to be that it was free with adds, but now after I updated it I cant listen to music anymore. total rip off"

46054,"Pandora",2013-04-23,5,"awesome   I love this app I listen to it every day and I like how they updated it. this is so cool and there is some songs I haven't heard in a while that I like plus you create your own stations."
46055,"Pandora",2012-03-25,1,"Very Disappointed   This app is a waste of time, it plays music of people, groups I have never heard of and music I would Never listen to. Granted this is a free app but must I be forced to listen to music not chosen by me! Not to mention the never-ending ads!"
46057,"Pandora",2011-12-03,4,"great app   This app works great, but however you should be aware that this app will use a lot of data while playing I use my home wifi, and or find a free wifi spot while I'm out so I don't burn through all my allotted data. I wish the widget was a little better."

46086,"Pandora",2011-12-20,5,"Awesome   This station is very easy to access and allows you to here a variety of different songs. One area I think this sight would benefit from. If people were allowed to pay to download by the song also select a specific song by an artist to listen too."
46087,"Pandora",2014-06-12,5,"Best internet radio   Great listening to pandora cuz' you can refine your music choices. I wish they can stay connected all the time."

46111,"Pandora",2011-12-25,1,"Worst app!   This app is my least favorite app. It always sends me annoying emails, even though I deleted it months ago because of them. Also, it doesn't let you access many songs. I would give it 0 stars if possible."
46112,"Pandora",2012-04-12,4,"good app!   Good mixes, good variety for the most part. I would suggest a sleep timer to allow listening at night or for short periods.BTW: Hey, freeloaders, pay for it and you won't have to listen to commercials (wow, what a concept)."

46167,"Pandora",2014-12-06,5,"amazing for music lovers   Music lovers will love this app. Create your own stations, and the music that plays on the station's is related to that station. This is an amazing app if you don't want to listen to the normal radio.You can also skip songs, but you have a limit unless you upgrade. But I find switching the station's until I find the song I like,  quite easy."
46168,"Pandora",2013-01-27,5,"great   Pandora gives me the music I like without having buy and download hundreds of different songs. I had a satellite radio account for many years but find Pandora to be superior in content."

46198,"Pandora",2013-06-08,3,"it's ok   What I highly dislike is having to say ""still listening"". You would think that after paying for 1yr. subscription not only eliminating the commercial you would get at least 8-10 hrs of listening time instead of a couple hrs.  Really gets irritating to constantly having to do that. Also every once in awhile I can hear 2 stations playing at the same time so I have to shut down my device & restart."
46201,"Pandora",2013-05-27,2,"it is now going to force you to pay for limet   I love Pandora but it has limet on free music per month and will force you to pay for the ad free on and is completely free on computer and phone not kindle fire."

46256,"Pandora",2012-02-22,5,"App works great!   This app works great, I am using a droid 3 and have no complaints.  People on here complaining about ads, should drop the 36 bucks for the year, or uninstall.  The world doesn't have the time to listen to your whining."

46282,"Pandora",2013-04-26,5,"i love it   its awesome but there is one downer... you can only search for a singer not an album or certain song."

46384,"Pandora",2011-10-26,4,"I Love Pandora!   I love Pandora for all the great music. However, I knock off a star because the Android app won't let you review songs that you have already listened too. Otherwise, this is a must have for any smartphone user!!!"

46408,"Pandora",2012-03-26,4,"good   it is the best thing to listen to free music with. The one downed to it is the the fact that after you have skipped 6 songs you have to wait and hour before being elageble to skip 6 more songs."

46430,"Pandora",2012-06-20,5,"best music app ever!   I spent alot of time tryingto find a good radio/music app and before Pandora all the others were horrible. Pandora works very well and is in my opinion the best music app out there"

And if you're complaining that Amazon doesn't update as frequently as you want maybe you should get apps that require updates a lot from the actual stock market. Pandora is a great app just like the amazon market"

46910,"Pandora",2017-09-13,5,"Five Stars   Works ok too many adds freeze it up. It's still pandora though."
46914,"Pandora",2012-08-24,5,"love it   you guys are crazy. and if u don't want ads, then buy the non ad version and stop complaining. it works amazingly for me."
46925,"Pandora",2012-02-10,5,"great app   This is a great app,I love it on my KF, The only thing that could be better if their was a volume buttom installed on the device for the app.!"

46940,"Pandora",2012-07-21,2,"i do not like it.   the songs get kind of repeditive.i think people should chose what gets played.also the appearance is a little to strange."
46944,"Pandora",2012-01-02,4,"cool app   Pandora is a great app for everyone.the only. thing is that if you type in super bass (a song by Nickie manaj)it plays songs in that catigory."
46947,"Pandora",2012-06-17,4,"pandora radio   The pandora app is pretty good and it was easy to download and start.  I do wish you could just play the songs you selected."
46949,"Pandora",2013-01-21,5,"babyiya   I like this because I can listen to music when ever.and my mom loves music a lot so I can give it to her and she can listen to music"

46964,"Pandora",2015-08-12,5,"Five Stars   Works as it should :)"
46966,"Pandora",2013-04-05,5,"the bass keeps dropping.   this is the best app made for the kindle fire.  I <3 radio only lets you have a daily amour of skips, while Pandora lets you have a certain amour per hour, on each channel.  like I said, best app made for music/industrial manners."
46967,"Pandora",2013-02-27,1,"recent updates now have pandora run in background   Have used Pandora on Kindles since 2011.  Unfortunately, their recent updates now have the program always running in the background. Even running ´Gemini´ type tools is not enough to keep the program terminated....Memory Is consumed.  Have taken the step of uninstalling the App."
46973,"Pandora",2012-03-10,4,"Pandora Listener   I would give the app five stars but it didn't have the status bar to tell how much longer the song is but still a great app!!!!!! :)"

46977,"Pandora",2011-10-24,2,"Not for me   I didn't really like the way Pandora chose music for me. I'd try to get it to go more toward my genre, but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I wasn't interested in. It also set up ""stations"" too frequently.I ended up deleting Pandora, and will have to find another app which suits me more."
46981,"Pandora",2012-08-20,5,"aw yeah!!!!!   its just awesome! and it works very well on the kindle fire and ummm yea its great Woooooooooooooo Woooooooooooooo woo"

I find your Pandora app to inferior to access Pandora radio as I do on my computer. I much more prefer to avoid your app and deal directly with Pandora. I was able to do so without android download. Why do I need to go thru amazon now when I have avoided in the past? Amazon should leave well enough alone."

47421,"Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"spotify is great   Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin  music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
47422,"Spotify",2016-07-31,5,"Love this app   I love this app. I put it on my phone first, but I had so much music it was taking up all the room on my phone. I deleted it and thought I had lost all my music, but when I downloaded Spotify to my tablet, all my music had been saved and I still was able to access it. It is different than Pandora in that you only get music from the artists you select. If you click follow, you will receive new songs for that artist as they come in. There is a free version without too many ads and a paid version. Right now I have the free version, but I am thinking about purchasing the paid version. Either way, you have access to lots of great music from your favorite artists."
47424,"Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"The ony music app you neec   I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
47425,"Spotify",2017-11-13,5,"Great for metal fans!   I love this app so much. I can listen to music and I can trust that the bands I like are getting paid for their work. (I use the free version so I experience the occasional ad) So much better than buying iTunes or using youtube for music. As a heavy metal fan some of the bands I like are less popular but I can find them all here. I am amazed some local and lesser known bands are featured on this service. It makes me glad that the ad revenue goes to supporting them in making more great music for my enjoyment."

47447,"Spotify",2015-09-13,5,"Best Music App   This app has the most variety of music available that I have seen in any app and it is so efficient. The playlists you create can be played offline as long as you have a premium plan which, compared to other music apps, are very affordable. I would reccommend Spotify for everyone."

47451,"Spotify",2015-08-31,4,"Best music app I've ever used.   Spotify is great, and I do have a Premium account for greater mobile listening and no ads.

Nice app for organizing music but don't like the idea that in order to listen off line need to pay for premium. Disappointing . I  won't be paying 10 $ a month. Maybe once and done. Where can I find a free app besides iTunes thats free???"
47510,"Spotify",2014-12-14,4,"very pleasant   I rather enjoy this music app. Is better than any other, in terms of variety. The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood.

I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash (think of that what you may because I just went to emøtiønal røad shøw yesterday (June 18, 2016)) so hehe.  But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic.

On my old kindle, it was amazing, but I recently got a new one and I immediately downloaded this app. But, when I downloaded it, I only got a limited amount of skips like I was on Pandora, and I can't choose to play a specific song. It bums me out."

Just wish I could get free music on my ipod shuffle, since that's what I use to keep me motivated when doing chores or exercising at the gym.  I even found a country song from the 80s I'd been wanting to hear for a long time, so this app doesn't just have ""new music""."

47758,"Spotify",2014-07-17,2,"I can't find the premium   What I don't understand about this app is why I can't get the premium. It's very stressful when I'm trying to find the premium and the kindle Appstore keeps telling me it doesn't exist. Every time I want to skip a song after I ran out of skips it pops up a reminder to get the premium. But how can do that when the Appstore says it doesn't exist?"

Other than that though, I love it!"
47791,"Spotify",2015-03-19,5,"amazing   I think this app is amazing. It was a little confusing at first but with their guide I was able to figure it out.

I have to listen in the random mode. I wanted to become a premium member, but there isn't any easy way to do that. If I could have figured that out Spotify would have gotten the high five."
47870,"Spotify",2016-07-07,4,"It's Pretty Great!   This app is really good for listening to music and the sound quality is good. I just wish they had more of Taylor Swift and other artists. Also at this point my spotify/kindle has glitches and I can't pull down the top of my screen and see the Spotify tab to skip forward and/or back. Other than that, this is a great app! However, when the trailer for “ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals. So I would highly recommend this app for all the music lovers. ( LIKE MEH!!! ) 🎆🎆🎆"
47873,"Spotify",2015-12-30,3,"doesn't always load next song   On my S5, this app is amazing. On my fire hd tablet, however, I often times have to manually skip to the next song. For whatever reason it doesn't always play through my entire playlist. It gets annoying. If they fixed that, I would give it a 5 star though."
47874,"Spotify",2016-07-31,4,"Spotify works and does what it says   App works pretty nicely. Only drawback is lots of commercials before switching to premium. Premium also gives full functionality which helps me like the app more."
47876,"Spotify",2016-01-12,4,"Awesome   Aside from the mobility issue since you need premium to listen without WiFi or data, the fact you can't play specific songs on android or Apple phones, it's the perfect music app for kindle or stationary devices like pc."
47878,"Spotify",2017-01-01,5,"Great!   Got for my Kindle Fire. Invested in family Premium, now it's perfect for the gym. I love Spotify and the app is great on Kindle."

Yes. Do I really care that much? No. My husband has the premium version and it's worth it to be able to take your playlists on the road with you. I'll probably upgrade soon."
47880,"Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"spotify is a must have..   Awesome when u have premium...  but it is also very cool if you don't want to spend the money to get premium. You just can't listen to it offline.  I enjoy listening to music whenever I'm bored so it can cheer me up. Definitely a 5 star. Must have. :)"

47898,"Spotify",2016-02-03,4,"Very good but...   Very good app allows you to get basically any song you want for free. Of course there are some songs not on their and the ads are annoying. But overall the best platform to get real published good songs."

It works very well for my needs and I am glad to have on my Kindle. I can now listen and enjoy the music I want. For those who gave this a three stars or lower I am sorry you did. It has a few bad points, but you have to over look them and move on. I mean for its free, and there's nothing perfect these days. Take my word for it, down load it and enjoy.

48012,"Spotify",2015-01-11,2,"I did enjoy the music collections once I found them   Unlike Pandora and Songza, once the music started on Spotify Music, I could find no obvious way to stop the app without logging-out. If there is an ""X"" or ""Quit"" it is well hidden.I did enjoy the music collections once I found them. There was quiet a variety to choose from. The sound quality was good on my Droid Turbo. The app did not always recognize my WiFi connection even when at 100% signal strength, telling me ""no internet connection.""Generally speaking I found this app to be overly complicated and lacking intuitive usage control. Yet the app has quite a following. As such I speculate it may be targeted at a demographic younger than my own.If you enjoy apps that require (in my opinion) a lot of interaction and (seem) heavily oriented to social media you may find Spotify Music worthwhile. It wasn't for me."

48064,"Spotify",2014-08-09,5,"just my thoughts   I absolutely love this app there wasn't a song that I looked for that I couldn't find. It even finds the album that the song came from. You can even save the whole album itself  if you wanted too. I even created a slow jams play list  and I love it cause it's a combination of old and new songs it's a perfect blend."

48080,"Spotify",2016-03-01,4,"The only reason for four stars   The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it often pauses at the end of a song. Before it will start again I have to go back to the play list and press play for the next song."
48083,"Spotify",2016-08-30,4,"Wonderful Selection   Superb selection of music.  Promises thirty minutes of add free listening; they never give you the full thirty minutes. I still love this app."

48120,"Spotify",2014-08-04,5,"Best music app if you have limited cellular data on your phone   I thought I'd never leave Pandora, but someone made me try Spotify and I haven't looked back since.  You can do a ""radio"" feature, but even better than that is that you can download the songs that you like the most, so you aren't wasting your cell data plan.  Just download the music over Wifi and take it to go!"
48123,"Spotify",2016-01-18,5,"MARIA'S review   This is a really great app and I highly recommend it. In some ways it is better than Pandora, but if you are someone  like me and loves music than I would definitely chose spotify over Pandora."

48166,"Spotify",2015-07-22,2,"Was a Great App   Spotify was a great app and worked seemlesly on my BlackBerry Z30, until the new update. Music used to play steady even after I went under the tunnel on the subway.  Now the music breaks down at times like a scratched CD and cuts off."

Also, needs to add support for up to 5 synced devices because the cost is bordering on too high. Strongly considering the Google Play Music streaming service but for now the catelogue is not as extensive."

Things that you can do on your pc but not tablet, like rearrange your downloaded playlists by artist for example. It can be annoying when try ing to find that one song in a list of hundreds."

48253,"Spotify",2014-07-31,5,"great music app   This is one of the best music apps on the appstore. Its awesome to be able to create your own playlist. The only thing i would reccomend is mixing up the radio music a little more, sometimes ill get the same song twice in a row or just the same set of songs over and over but other than that, no complaints"
48256,"Spotify",2017-11-14,5,"Awesome   Amazing. Love the quality. Has all my faviort music in one spot."

48260,"Spotify",2014-08-21,5,"Sweet app   Spotify is possibly the most useful music app I have ever used. It is easy to find new music, browse old music, compile playlists, and listen to other people's playlists with it. I am so happy with the quality and speed. No complaints except for the infrequent and short commercials, no bother though."
48263,"Spotify",2017-10-04,5,"Five Stars   I absolutely love spotify, just widh they had a real live customer service instead of chat and email only."

48302,"Spotify",2015-11-04,5,"Very good quality music app   Very good quality music app! Love getting free music too...However, the premium package costs too much for me. I'm a college kid who can't afford spending $9/month. If it was $3, that would be awesome!"
48310,"Spotify",2017-06-02,5,"Five Stars   Excellent"
48312,"Spotify",2017-09-29,5,"Five Stars   THANK you"
48315,"Spotify",2015-09-12,3,"It was better.   Spotify was great until you need to get premium to listen to what ever song you wanted instead of the shuffle. It was my favorite app, but I have to resort to YouTube now to listen to whatever song I want to hear."
48322,"Spotify",2016-02-25,4,"Good but should be cheaper for premium   I really like this app but I think that premium should be cheaper or free that way if someone doesn't have the money to pay nine dollars a month  then they have to pay less."
48323,"Spotify",2017-07-04,4,"Awesome   It works great, but, you have to have WiFi for it to play music. Plz make it so you dont have to use WiFi."
48327,"Spotify",2017-02-20,5,"Awesome!😀   Spotify is great! It has most of the songs you want to hear and you can make your own library of songs!"
48331,"Spotify",2016-03-24,5,"Best music app ever   I want to hear a song so I find it and play it. I want to listen to an album, an artist, I find them and I hit play. So simple and a seemingly endless array of music."
48333,"Spotify",2015-11-30,4,"Mostly Great!   I love this app! I use it almost everyday. The only concern I have is that sometimes it'll quit working and uninstall itself from my device. Other than that the app is definitely worth getting."
48335,"Spotify",2017-07-27,5,"Five Stars   Great platform, all the music I want and that I didn't even know I wanted."
48336,"Spotify",2017-04-26,5,"Amazing   spotify is amazing, u can even listen to music without using WiFi or data."

48343,"Spotify",2016-08-15,5,"Getting My Praise On!!!!   I was looking for an app that had all my Gospel music..Happy to say Spotify delivered...Excellent song choices and easy to navigate."
48344,"Spotify",2016-01-30,2,"great service, but terrible software   Love the spotify service and selection, but the app is probably the only one that consistently crashes on my mobile and desktop platforms. Recommend changing your developer team!"
48348,"Spotify",2016-01-17,5,"love free music use this   Yo I love linken park so I got this and oh man this is the best app ever because its free but the adds only bother for in e minute then it leave yoyu alone for thirty minute🐨👍👍😂"
48349,"Spotify",2016-08-14,5,"Yassss   If I could discrbe this app is one word it would be Yassss some people wonder if Spotify premium is worth it but it is trust be.☺☺☺☺"
48350,"Spotify",2015-12-29,5,"Spotlight Review   I really like this app! Unlike other apps you can listen to music by your favorite artist exclusively. The ability to create multiple playlists of your choice is an added bonus as well."
48351,"Spotify",2014-08-06,5,"Hear Any Song in a Matter of Seconds   I've used a lot of music apps - Pandora, iHeart Radio, Tune in, etc. - but never one with such amazing search speed, ease of use, and nearly instantaneous playback. Old, new, even rare, obscure music --this app  has found every single one I searched for and started playing it in only a few seconds."
48352,"Spotify",2015-12-12,5,"perfect   I recommend this because it is great for researching on the web and listening to music in one device instead of using other technology for one and having to use another device for the other"

48381,"Spotify",2015-03-03,5,"Good but I need help...   It's a very excellent app! No bugs (so far). But I was wondering what happens when your trial ends... Do you have to pay? Or is there just more adds (I can deal with adds). I would appreciate if you answer my question. Thanks again for this awesome app!"
48384,"Spotify",2017-03-09,5,"Amazing   Everybody should get this app listen to music in the morning it gets u active and hype"
48394,"Spotify",2014-08-04,3,"Okay.   I love spotify, but you shouldn't have to pay for anything on it. Like downloading music so you can listen offline. Why not just switch to pandora? Even though spotify is good, it only deserves three stars. It could earn five stars from me if it would only let me listen to music offline for free."

53005,"Spotify",2015-12-06,4,"Great. Ehh. Resentment....   I must begin by saying I am your avid music junkie! If one could be persecuted for excessive music enjoyment I'd be infamous by now.I began using Spotify per word of mouth when I was overheard verbally destroying Pandora. I paid for whatever Pandora markets their non free service as. It was a waste of hope and money. After a few skips (mind you these skips are more than a free Pandora user) I ran into the same skip limit as if I didn't shell out whatever little clams to avoid hearing ads and having limited skips. The tirade was volatile and entertaining to those in ear shot. Nearing the end Spotify was introduced to my ears and based off what I heard I thought GREAT!, and I gave it a shot!GREAT; because now I have the ability to control my own playlists and skips freely, no fuss or gimmicks (this is with Premium, after the fail of Pandora free and paid services, I figured I'd start from the top with Spotify and see if slopes or avalanches downhill) and to me that was BLISS! With a wide variety of music I cannot live without daily ranging from Acoustic UK Pop Bands, to Old School Hip Hop KINGS such as KRS-One, Audio Two, and the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to our Modern Day (I Guess This Is What We Call) Rap Music, to my rock band faves like AFi and Blink 182, to Beyonce and Katy Perry for the softer Pop Music feel for the kids ears and Reggae and 60's & 70's KINGS and Queens of Soul Music, I can go on but by now you must get that the variety of music is in ample abundance and I LOVE THAT! I even have French rappers and singers songs, Idk what they are saying but the music holds my attention. That's what made Spotify so GREAT to me I have exactly 20 Playlists with over 1700 songs, and I created all the playlists to my liking and ALL available offline for my enjoyment anywhere. I can skip endlessy, I can jump to another playlist whenever I feel the desire and that's how music should be enjoyed! So why the Ehh?...Ehh; with all the above praise that I will not recant, in fact I can ad more to it, there is a bummer to Spotify. Unbeknownst to me, the songs added to the playlists actually take up external device memory. Being that at that time I had the app installed on both my iPod and iPhone I never paid attention to it. But after tossing the Pod I noticed with my iPhone that Spotify was using up 4.5 GBs of the allotted 6.3 GBs. There weren't enough photos, games, and apps to remove to clear up space. My resolve was to purchase a tablet I know that has external storage per MicroSD cards. I ended up with the Kindle Fire HDX 8 8 GB and purchased the 32 GB MicroSD card. My plan was to download Spotify move it to the MicroSD and never have to worry about external storage and Spotify clashing again. To my greatest disappointment and I mean grave disappointment at this point, it turned out that SPOTIFY CANNOT BE MOVED TO MY 32 GB MicroSD card! It was infuriating to be casual at the least ok.Resentment; Spotify sound to good to be true and in a twisted way it is! If you cannot afford Premium the app is useless, and that's just based off the experiences I've read over on reviews from Mobile App users. If you do have Premium you have to then be weary of external memory being eaten up. If I only knew Spotify unlike let's say Netflix, cannot be moved to the MicroSD card from my HDX 8 I probably would've gotten a bigger Kindle (external memory wise). What really makes that little pinch feel like a shark bite is that after Amazon's preinstalled entities we consumers of the HDX 8 8 GB start off with a mere 5.3 GB!So how does one cope with the ups and downs of Spotify and external memory clashes? You grab your headphones, scroll your favorite Playlists you created, skip and scroll through your music freely, and be thankful! Why? Because it could always be worse.. (coughs) Pandora (coughs). In writing this review I see where some of my own actions not necessarily mistakes, may have lead to adverse feelings towards Spotify. But I do have to say this it is a superb application. I have it on my iPhone for on the go, for the home depends on where at home, it can be either the XBOX, the Smart TV, and now the HDX 8. You can't really beat or put a price on that, Spotify however did and it's only $12.99/month. What's that the cost of one album in stores nowadays? Yea I'll pass and will continue to pass the word on about Spotify. Hope you found this helpful, you will enjoy Spotify and the monthly cost is a nonfactor, Premium is the ONLY way to really get a full grasp on the application and it's features. If you claim to love music you NEED Spotify Premium you can't go wrong."

53106,"Spotify",2016-01-10,4,"Nice app, but could use some upgrades.   I subscribe to Spotify premium and I got this app for our Fire TV stick. It was a little misleading though as I thought it was a full app for the TV. I expected it to work much like the app on my tablet or phone where you can see the playlists and all that right within the app. But how this works is that you play your music on another device like your phone or desktop and you can broadcast it over your TV. It works, but I don't like that I need to use a 2nd device to change the songs, etc. Also, sometimes the connection isn't stable even when the internet connection is perfect. For the most part it's ok, but I think app could use some work.I do test these products out myself and give a very honest review. I am one that reads the reviews carefully when making purchases so I appreciate those who take the time to post reviews! If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a ""Yes"" vote on my review!"

However, I HAVE used it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

54350,"Spotify",2016-03-02,5,"I love that amazon has apps to download   I love that amazon has apps to download. The  apps are super helpful. Once again this app is Amazing, This is a way to shop, watch tv, and enjoy social media. This has been great with  my fire stick! My cable provider was proud to provide me with 200+ HD channels. My biggest reason for cutting the cord was that I watched about five channels, of which four could be obtained without cable. They always offer more, more, more...but I wanted less! So, even though cord-cutting is really about not paying for those ""filler"" channels for most of us, the good news is you can still have them for free! Pluto.TV provides a similar ""guide"" interface as most cable providers, and over 100 HD channels. And it's mostly just that: those filler channels you throw on the screen when you're bored, or to have something on in the background when doing other things. If you're into some of the cable channels, you'll notice a decline in program quality. If you're a cord-cutter who just wants the option to have ""those other 100 channels I really don't watch"", and without commercials taking up 1/3 of the airtime, Pluto.TV will fill that void at no cost"

I wish they had access to all musicians and all songs, but their lists have come a long way since the first time I used the service a few years ago. The only thing missing is the ability to easily move a song from one of my playlists to another. Adding a ""Move to"" option in the drop down menu of each song would be a big plus. Also, I don't mind watching an ad every 30 minutes to have this service for free. :)"

56310,"Spotify",2014-08-27,4,"good app   This app is good, the only problems I have with it is the ads, I know since I don't pay for it there's ads but when I'm listening to death metal and deathcore, I don't want to know about the new pop albums, latest one was the new prince album. The point of ads is to help sell your product but if it has no relevants to what I like or even listen to then it has failed its purpose. I think you should have ads based on what you listen to even if that means using peoples saved music to get the idea of what they like.The supply of music on this is great I have found everything I wanted to find and that's better than other apps like Pandora. I get to at least listen to the band I want to even if its not from the same album ( suggested songs take from other albums and play songs from there )"

I do not yet understand computers well and Spotify regardless, brings mevery good music. Spotify also has shown me how to better understand types of grouping I wouldn't have thought of! I very much appreciate the Premiums option of increased digital audio quality and ability to easily interface with useful software currently, I can and often do listen to Spotify music using Jriver mc 19 either, via headphone or preamplifier, There are many such Software options available as trial for you to learn more about music and computer audio. These points are a very basic starting group for Spotify. If you are as new to computer audio as Iam, enjoy and slowdown. Lee McDonald a.k.a.GREENSIDEUP"

57091,"Spotify",2014-11-23,2,"Good, but I'm not paying.   I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, (750+ song on several playlists that I use a lot) but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app."

I do still have adds though but that's not that bad.Cons: 1. The premium cost ten dollars a month! I'm nine and I know that's expensive!2.I know this isn't Spotify fault but Taylor Swift took her music off of Spotify and I'm one of her fans! Thank you for reading!"

57473,"Spotify",2015-09-11,2,"Not Worth It   I loved Spotify before the new update but now after the company decided to tweak it a bit and update a newer version, Spotify is now horrible. You can't choose what song you want to listen to (it absolutely INSISTS on shuffle play) and then you can only flip three or four songs before you are FORCED to listen to the current song. And I mean FORCED. You can't exit out of the song and pick a new artist, nor can you even flip to the next song on the shuffle list. Even with the four song choices you have, the user has to have premium otherwise they can't see the next song on the shuffle list. If you do happen to tap the arrow going to the next song, if it's a song you don't like from the artist, then you only have two more completely random tries before you get what you get and you don't throw a fit. For me though, I just deleted the app and went searching for another music app. Sorry Spotify, you just lost a customer. :/"

57645,"Spotify",2015-09-18,5,"spotify is the best   With an almost surprisingly large catalogue, there is something for everyone. You can discover (or rediscover) all kinds of great music. The app runs great, I haven't had any real problems. The only problem I do have is with some of the artists pulling their music, but I can't really fault spotlight for that. The ads for the free version can get a bit annoyingly repetitive at times but it's not so bad. Personally, I find paying for the upgraded version is HIGHLY worth it, especially if you listen to music a lot. Not only is it ad free, but you can listen to music offline, which is great for things like long car trips."

I was very shocked with the songs I did download whom did not display an explicit tag, but once played there were curse words throughout the song.

58185,"Spotify",2015-07-22,5,"This is genius!   Where do I even begin! I have started to pay for Spotify almost a year ago, and I have since ""sold"" this beautiful app to 6 friends. Probably need to collect on commission! So how amazing is the fact that this is the second app in the world for Music/Radio App. Spotify offers you a selection of over 8 millions of songs (if I am not mistaken) that can be added to your current playlist. You can also follow playlists that are created by other users, they range from different genres and also the playlists are updated very often which makes you stay up to date with whatever awesome genre you pick. Another GREAT thing is that Spotify lets you save as many songs offline as the memory on your phone allows!! Which is absolutely genius! If you are going away somewhere and you know you won't have access to your mobile internet/data then you can just save any song or playlist offline and enjoy it without worrying that it's going to buffer for hours, it is also great in case you don't want to upload anything through iTunes or a PC and just have ""disposable"" playlists access. You can also control the fact that you can turn off data usage for 30 days if you have limited data plan. It is super affordable plus you may score a discount if you are a student. I remember when this app first came out and it was predicted that in 2-3 years after its release it will become epic and it has!! I am so glad that I kept it around!!! P.S. You can also use it on a computer - I personally do not use it so not sure what's the story there, but as long as you will sign into your account it should be as easy as 123. I love me some Spotify!!!"

With spotify you can create playlists of songs YOU want to hear! And with only a couple dollars you can listen to your music offline as well. When you first create your account you get a month of free skips and other premium features. Or join near the holidays and get a SEASON of premium music.You can browse other people's created playlists and listen to new music fast. I listen to spotify literally ALL DAY and recommend it to everyone. Definitely a five star app."

58689,"Spotify",2016-11-22,4,"Meh   Some covers the artists, like nightcore, are not on there and some of the songs are not available unless you pay for premium. Lots of ads, but there are also times where you can get up to a half hour of ad free music. They don't have actual radio stations either. You can make playlists and while not all the music is available, there is a wide variety. You need a decent WiFi connection or it won't work that well. Searches are kind of irritating because you look up a song and it shows cds, artists, and songs with related or same words. It also doesn't have the option to delete/deactivate your account. Overall, it is only great if you spend money to buy premium, but is a decent source of music if you have WiFi."

58706,"Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"Why havent u subscribed to Premium yet! Go do it! 😎   Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

I am amazed at how many artists and bands I have been introduced to via Spotify. I love the ""related artists"" sections provided, that let's me explore even more bands  I just hope I have enough time, left here on earth, to hear it all. Also having the ability to play your music on pretty much any device you can think of is great. Keep up the good work. Worth every penny of my subscription."

58799,"Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Stream vs Storage.   I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."
58804,"Spotify",2016-02-17,5,"Get it. Srsly   Awesome app. I like the fact that you can search by artist and get JUST that artist, instead of getting a weird mix of music and wondering how in the hell THAT song made it in there. Also, the genre specific radio stations give a wide variety of artists, in case you're wanting to just have it on while you're working or working out. Just have the free version, thinking about upgrading to the premium to see what all the hub bub's about."
58814,"Spotify",2014-06-18,5,"woohoo!   I started using spotify on the computer and now I have it of all of my devices. I would reccomend it to anyone that loves music."
58817,"Spotify",2016-11-08,5,"I would buy this off in a heartbeat!!!   This App is amazing!!! You can listen to songs make playlists and a lot more!!! What I really like is that I was listening to Spotify while writing this. So you could listen to music while doing something on your device!!!"
58818,"Spotify",2017-05-20,5,"Music Store in your hand!   It has a great selection of music. When paired with Pandora, this app is a great way to discover new artists or music. Some may complain about having to pay for more freedom in playing music. While this is a downside, one can always purchase the soundtrack from Amazon, Google or in a physical store. Or dig deep and apply for premium. 😏"
58821,"Spotify",2014-06-24,5,"Awesome!!!   I use this app a lot for playing music while I play apps such as multiplayer shooter, and scribble nauts remix."
58822,"Spotify",2017-04-18,5,"Everything is great..... It's just the ads   The app is overall great it lets me Pick my own music and makes Custom Playlists for the music I like! Which is pretty amazing. I've been using this app for a solid year and things have worked out really good for me.But there's just one thing I hate to go threw..... The adsI just hate that tormenting Man's voice that just goes ""The next 30 minutes are add free! Thanks to are following sponsors.""I like it because I can just watch the short ad video then I can get back to enjoying my music time.But I can't play the ad it just freezes my App and Takes forever to load (Which sucks a lot since I'm a music lover)Sometimes if I'm LUCKY! (See I caps the word lucky)The ad might play, But other times it doesn't play at all which freakin' stinks!Anyway I don't know if other people using this app experiences any problems like these (I just hope not)-That one random person who's ranting on a app about ads. How pathetic"
58826,"Spotify",2016-12-08,5,"Kristina   Love it...can listen to my music anywhere and everywhere..whether its brand new or from the 90s..!!!!"
58828,"Spotify",2016-08-30,5,"Spot On   I like the ability to create my personal playlist as well as listen to random selections.  Very easy to use.  I am 63 years young and still rock in.  Which we had this in my school years, beats carrying cases of albums and 8 Tracks around."
58829,"Spotify",2017-03-05,5,"Best that I have tried so far...loving Spotify!   Move over Pandora and iHeart....I have found Spotify and there is no turning back."

58838,"Spotify",2016-09-04,4,"4-Stars   I gave this 4 stars for one reason - There are times when I'm listening to a song and then out of the blue - it just cuts off. Why does this happen? I can be enjoying a real good song that I added to my up next listen and minutes later, it just shifts songs, without notice. Really annoying! Over all, I love spotify. Fix this problem and I'll be golden. :)"
58841,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"Game changer for music lovers   My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials"
58846,"Spotify",2015-03-04,2,"Meh..   Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."
58847,"Spotify",2017-01-30,5,"It's great   Great app😍😍😍😍 love it"

58853,"Spotify",2014-06-12,5,"Great design   This app works exactly like the desktop version and allows you to do everthing that you would with the pc version of the software. The offline function works like it should. I would remcomend this app to anybody that needs the spotify app to be abble to login to there spotify acount. I love the prenium option of being able to put music offline. It is like having an MP3 with all the music you can possibly think of. AMAZING service."
58855,"Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well   Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen .  .  . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
58856,"Spotify",2017-04-08,5,"Get it if you are picky about songs.   I love this app it is the best apps ever it is 1 out of the 7 apps I downloaded on my Tablet but if you are not patient then sorry , every 30 minutes they give you like 2 or 3 adds no biggie.  I am even listening to Paris on Spotify right now !!!😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😁😁😁"
58863,"Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Spotify is cool   Spotify offers a wide range of music, podcasts, and audio books. The ability to create playlists any way you want with an unlimited amount of music is cool to me. Listening to new albums from artists like, Troye Sivan, and Years and Years, is pretty neat. And the 30 seconds without ads perk is a relief after listening to radio music with numerous commercials and not enough music. The only problem with Spotify is some of the glitching I've experienced with Android tablets, other than that, Spotify is cool."
58869,"Spotify",2014-06-10,5,"Excellent spotify!   I can't find fault with this app. It's excellent. I love music and spotify is a dream come true for music lovers. Every artist and every song I look for I find. Keep up the great work spotify"

58885,"Spotify",2016-10-12,4,"Great!!   This is a great app. The only problem I have is that it is not very self-explanatory. If you are not app savvy it is somewhat confusing. But the music selections are awesome."
58887,"Spotify",2017-04-19,5,"Better than Pandora   Spotify let's you listen to songs that you want to listen to! If you're a music person you need Spotify."
58891,"Spotify",2014-06-17,5,"Awesome   It's amazing to listen to any song from any artist. I don't have premium and that's not a problem I can listen to the songs I downloaded on my Kindle when I don't have internet. All and all spotify provides something I just cannot find with Pandora.GOOD JOB SPOTIFY"
58895,"Spotify",2017-04-27,5,"******   Great the best"
58897,"Spotify",2015-11-22,3,"Ughh   This app is annoying. It constantly pauses itself meaning you have to unlock your device and physically open the app and start it again. It doesn't continuously play even after hitting the loop button meaning it'll play a song and leave a 5-10 minute break in it. And the advertisements are aggressive to the point of insanity. That being said it's the only app of its kind that allows you to select your songs from all songs so I guess it's a necessary evil."
58906,"Spotify",2016-04-03,5,"excellent   Very nice app, I love it."
58911,"Spotify",2016-03-23,3,"alright but.......   I deleted it by mistake and downloaded it again but I could not sign back i n because I had forgotten my password.

58954,"Spotify",2015-09-12,2,"New update :(   I loved spotify until they got their new update. Now it'd similar to pandora and you can't choose what song , you can't listen to a specific song, and there is no longer a queue so you can't know what song your going to listen to. I hate the new update, now you only can use those things if you purchase the premium :( spotlight is a good app but now it's just not as good."
58956,"Spotify",2017-04-13,3,"Good, but buggy on Kindle   On any other device, I would probably give this a 5/5, but there are certain bugs on the Kindle that desperately need fixing. For one, Spotify has a tendency to crash randomly for no apparent reason. Secondly, typically when I open up the app, it acts as if there's no internet conncection (Home page, browse page, search bar, and Recently Listened all fail to load), even when connected to WiFi. I can still access my playlists and saved albums (because despite what it says, it is actually connected) but whenever I try to access the kenu for a tracks it says ""No internet connection"". However, despite all of this, the app is far from unusable. Usually after the app crashes and you go back into it, it works fine, and a lot of the time stuff will eventually load as you're using the app. I just wish it was more consistently reliable."

And it probably always will...It's probably because you're trying to install malware on my system!!! And my system is like coughing like a 100 year old man, & passes out* Since it freezes FIRST, before shutting down. I noticed this after an update too...Hmmm...So YES, you read that right folks! They are currently embroiled in a malware scandal! So far it only effects desktop computers. So I don't use it on my computer anymore. Only on my smartphone which is lagged so bad, that any playlist (online or off) has ever loaded up. It tries to load up the last song I played, & always gives me an error message. Instead I just hit ""Home"" before the load completes that gives me an error message. By interrupting it & selecting home, I can get to my playlist. Hate this drama. PS. Why are you taking away my favorite songs again?! Is it because you're also reported to NOT pay the artists' as much as their lawyers would want?! Yea, I read that about you recently as well!"

When I first got this app, it was a dream come true, being able to listen to any song whenever I wanted to (if I had WiFi) and the variety of the radio stations. But a few days ago, the app updated and I have no say in what I listen to unless you have premium and I'm forced to shuffle play but after 5 skips you can't skip anymore. Please fix this and convert back the original version of Spotify where you have the freedom to choose what you listen to and whenever you want to listen to it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you choose if you want the app or not."

Sound quality is amazing! My only wish is I can play music without premium, so when I dont have access (wifi is needed if you dont have premium) I just use my mp3 player when I dont have wifi. Otherwise its awesome I have had playlist with over 300 songs so defiantly a lot of song space in a playlist.  You can even watch the late night show with jimmy fallon so win win over all great app defiantly get it if your looking for music. Sorry for rambling on!"

Also, the people that came up with spotify don't think of their listeners. Not everyone is the same. There was a very offensive commercial advertising spotify that kept playing and I got tired of hearing it so now it is uninstalled.  Act professional people."

It only has"" link your account"" I guess the icon and premium connection is stuck on my Alexa app forever. Tried to cancel my account on Spotify website. Can't do that either.

59944,"Spotify",2016-08-24,5,"Best app available for music lover's   Absolutely one of the best apps I have downloaded. The music selection is immense. I took the free trial and plan to buy the monthly subscription. I am a big music fan. This gives me the ability to experience all genres."
59945,"Spotify",2014-09-11,1,"Oh, so I have to pay to listen to my own music I already own?   BEST SCAM EVER!!!!  At first I couldn't believe people would pay for this service.  Then I looked around at the examples of ineptitude around me. YES I CAN.  Where to begin...First, disclaimer:  I'm an audiophile.  I do not get paid or profit in any way, even indirectly from any of these companies.  I'm just a true music lover that happens to be logical also, and cannot stand by and watch people make a horrible mistake.  So enough said... now let's get to the details. Or if not, skip to the bottom line.1.  Algorithm.  Spotify is trying to do nothing else but copy the brilliant Music Genome Project (Pandora) algorithm, but fails miserably.  All algorithms have to learn first, that's understandable, the problem is that there is something wrong with this algorithm, or the pool where it has to choose from is just not very good. I picked Alternative at one point, and 2 songs later Spotify shoves a New Age song at me, couple of songs after, I'm listening to Punk Rock.  In short, Pandora's algorithm is certainly better, and that's an understatement.2. GUI.  Not horrible, but certainly not the best.  Takes a bit to figure out where all is, and it's not automatically intuitive and at the ready.  Takes you several clicks just to find where to skip the song being played. Note to developers: THIS SHOULD BE AT THE READY!!!!  If it's playing, you have to give the choice to get rid of it on the fly.  Minor tick on this one overall, but that skip should be nice and handy, which is a major flaw in my eyes. Nothing like being stuck or having to dig through a couple of menus just to get rid of a horrible song.3. Paying to play owned music.  This at first looked like a plus compared to Pandor, but in close analysis, it makes no sense to a logical person.  While superior to Pandora in the fact you can play your own music (if you pay a monthly fee), if you own your music, why do you have to pay to listen to it AGAIN? And pay monthly?????  Can someone make sense of this to me?  Why are people paying for this, again????  Ridiculous.  Developers:  The idea to mixing streamed music as part of payment, should go hand in hand with being able to play the customer's already owned music FOR FREE!!!  Otherwise, why even have this feature?  Customers could just buy Poweramp, which they only have to pay for it once, for less than your monthly fee, AND has superior and more thorough features than your service.  Let the people play their owned music for free.4. Equalizer.  Oh yeah, 5 bands. TOTALLY IMPRESSED.  Look up Poweramp.5. Cost.  So basically, the only reason to buy this service, is to listen to new music on the fly, unlimited, right? Oh wait, the algorithm is not that good.  Well, guess you will listen to music you don't like...A LOT.  Oh yeah, and to boot, you want people to pay for the same thing as given by Pandora, but pay TWICE AS MUCH per month???Did I mention this is a brilliant scam?HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you want to listen to new, streamed music monthly, get Pandora (for half the price).  If you want great sound quality and hands down the best music player in mobile, get Poweramp. Oh yeah, and you only have to pay once (for several devices, not just every device), and will cost you less than what you will pay in one month for Spotify."
59949,"Spotify",2015-10-25,1,"This app was amazing until....   This app was great. It has anything I could want to listen to, which is cool since I like pretty much everything. But now, since the new update doesn't allow you to pick your own songs, I can't listen to it anymore. I've tried using it, but it's frustrating trying to find a specific Misfits song or something, then suddenly, I get stuck on a band I didn't even want to listen to. Until Spotify let's me pick my own stuff again, I'm deleting it"

Missing albums for many of the artists that they do have (for many of the ones I follow and have in my playlists). The ads for their own company will blow out your eardrums. Don't know why they have to have them be so loud. It doesn't really change when you lower the volume on the device you have.The app cuts out shortly after I enter my browser or go to text. It forces me to remain on the app at all times. Can't even browse Facebook.Yeah, you should get it but be prepared for manual updates and a long list of problems."

60033,"Spotify",2014-10-02,5,"Replace Pandora?   I've only been on Spotify for a week now, but I think this may replace Pandora as my favorite music app.  Like Pandora, you create your own stations.  However, you can pick only the songs you want to hear right from the beginning.  It's not like you ""seed""the station with a song or artist, then watch it go into crazy directions.  Yes, it only shows a certain amount of skips, but if you create your own playlist with the songs you want, then it really isn't a big deal.  In addition, you do have to hear the occasional advertisement, but they are few and far between.The big difference to me is the cost of premium membership.  I believe Pandora charges about $30/year, while Spotify is $10/month.  That is a huge difference, however Spotify let's you not only listen without interruption, but you can skip to your heart's content, and listen to ALL your favorite songs.  AWESOME!Despite the advantages, I think I'll stick to the free version.  Just can't justify $120/year for music."
60034,"Spotify",2015-11-24,5,"Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music   I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love.  It has way more than other subscription services I've tried.  The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another.  I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device.  I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials  Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient.  I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly  works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs?  When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

60046,"Spotify",2016-11-14,5,"Spotify is the go-to music app   Spotify is the best go-to music app available.  I have had an account with Spotify for a few years now, and I have not been disappointed.  I have discovered many great songs by artists that would never have radio play because stations play the top 20 nonstop.  I have created so many playlists, and if you are a paid member you can have songs offline to listen when away from wifi and to not use data.  There are also already user created playlists you can save or listen to, and I honestly use one with Native American drums to fall asleep every night! It has helped with insomnia! I also have added a family account so my kids can have their own playlists,  which I can keep track of. At anytime I can add or remove songs from their lists as the primary account holder.  It is a good way to give them some music freedom, without it being explicit songs I would never know about.The app itself can be used free, but with some limitations. Give the paid membership a try just once, and you'll understand. Love, love, love Spotify!"

When you try to activate a premium feature, it just tells you that you can't activate it. It doesn't even tell you how to get premium, and I can't find the premium option anywhere. Unless you know how to get premium, do not get this app because it will be a waste of time."

This is an amazing app that just keeps getting better, well worth the price for the paid version, but there is still a free version as well, I believe.  I can plug my phone into my stereo, then sit in some other room of the house and control what plays from my Kindle.  A seemingly endless supply of music.  I have fun trying to stump the system by asking for obscure artists, I usually am surprised that it finds what I am looking for.  I'm not sure if there is a way to suggest additional artists or albums, but that would be a nice addition if there isn't."

60088,"Spotify",2015-11-22,1,"was awesome...   It was a good music service until they made it like mobile where  you have to shuffle rather than play any song you want.  Especially sucks when you listen to bands who's albums are like books: meant to be listened to from beginning to end, not out of order."
60089,"Spotify",2016-03-27,4,"Listen to the whole album!   This is a great music app! I love how you can listen to any song on an album and download songs (premium) to listen to without using data! Great app just one issue: It just randomly pauses and when I go to look at the app the pause button isn't hit and it won't resume playing unless I hit pause and play again. Great app just had that one issue. Definitely recommend over Pandora, Slacker, iHeartRadio, etc"
60094,"Spotify",2016-03-21,5,"very good   The Premium version is very good!"
60098,"Spotify",2014-08-04,2,"Its like free.   I tried to play a tune from the list and it wont let you. Instead it says SHUFFLE, meaning they mix up the songs you hear. If you go to a premium choice (which probably costs money) you can have the freedom to choose and select. These sights interrupt your listening to inject commercials and if you want to pay money they stop. Its like free....but at a cost.When cable companies first started competing with long established network stations for viewers their mantra was, ""we know you have to pay for cable, but we don't tie you down with endless commercials. Has anyone watched cable programming lately? Now you pay large sums for the cable and they inundate you with ads.Pandora is the same.....don't want to pay, we interrupt your play. It's all about the money and getting more."

60115,"Spotify",2016-06-02,5,"yass.   I love my music. And I love having it all around me at all times. And I feel like with Spotify, you can go on any device, log in and listen to all your favorite Playlists and Albums and Singers. And I swear I'm not trying to sound like a commercial or anything, I just find Spotify to be a very efficient way of listening to music, and without music I would be totally lost to the world. So, what I'm trying to say is, Spotify is a very easy and manageable way of listening to music, new or old, at all times. And, yes, it has commercials, but only one every 30 minutes and, apparently, with Spotify Premium, you can have music with NO commercials for 3 months for 99¢!!! I love Spotify."
60118,"Spotify",2015-03-30,5,"Spotify Premium makes this the best source for music   I would have dropped out of college, fell asleep while driving, and been in severe road-rage-induced car accidents were it not for Spotify's nearly constant stream of music for me. Thank you Spotify. You're the best. Keep up the good work!Spotify also has great customer service for when you have any issues. I have been using Spotify Premium for over 4 years now. I recently had to use the free version for just a day or two while working through a problem I was having with my premium account and I realize why someone might not like it. There are definitely a lot of ads and a lot less freedom with the free version, but I believe the premium is worth it. If your'e a student anywhere, it's only $5 a month, and that's a lot less than a new CD. I love that it instantly syncs across all my devices so my playlists are with me in my car, work, my personal laptop, and even my phone. It's just great."

I live in Tucson, AZ and have been Care-giving for my 81 y o Father for the past 9 years out of my home.  His health recently hit an all time low placing him into Home Hospice status.  My Sister (49 y o) who lives in Charlotte, NC contacted her two sons (18 & 22 y o - my Fathers Grandsons) requesting they put together a playlist for my Dad including his favorite recording artists including but not limited too Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker, & Jethro Tull. They new this was a job to be done best by SPOTIFY.The Playlist was quickly assembled by the Grandsons, they e-mailed me (55 y o) my new created User Name & Password, I followed simple provided download directions. The Playlist appeared upon my Log-in I pressed Scramble Play, and I had one very happy, sick but smiling Father for the following 3.5 hours. Since yesterday he has enjoyed the mixed playlist 7 additional times and can't wait for tomorrow morning to come!Thank You Spotify!!!!!!!"

I cannot praise you guys enough for such a user friendly program for all ages to enjoy. Thank you!!!"
60127,"Spotify",2014-06-21,4,"Pretty good overall   I like that there is a huge amount of music available, that seems to make Spotify more likely to have the specific types I am interested in.  I also like being able to search and find entire CDs of music and put them into an easily accessible list.  Kind of like having CDs on my computer.  I do wish that there was info on each CD or artist, or the lyrics, the way that Pandora does."

What is great so far is that the user can choose the music they want to hear!  Unlike other music apps. What I am not sure of yet is can I as a mom of a pre-teen set parental controls that only I will be able to remove. There are some racy lyrics out there that I don't want my children exposed to just yet... including language or suggestive themes.so an update is in the future. As of this writing only I have used it and at that not long enough to vet it.."

I LOVE THIS APP!!! :D also in. 16 so... If your a teen lookin for music and etc. This is soooooo for you!!! :3 :D"
60140,"Spotify",2016-07-10,5,"Loved it from the moment it first came out!   I probably should've known that is was too good to be true.  For those of you who joined spotify early enough you may recall how similar in appearance the desktop app was when compared to itunes, so similar in fact, that you could easily have mistaken it for itunes, except all the music was free!  Free has a cost though and 10$ a month for premium unlimited (when the equivalent will only buy you 10 songs from itunes, which btw has a limited number of downloads before you have to REBUY IT AGAIN) out weighs the competition pretty heavily.Perhaps in a wise move, the Spotify management did away with the Apple itunes-esque design, and replaced it with pretty much the current design that we have today.  Unfortunately, the new design took a few steps backwards from its original functionality, certain key features seem to be missing or lacking, and I personally found the old design to be more aesthetically pleasing if not simply easier to navigate.Pros:-Free with ads, or 10$ monthly membership which is 1000% worth it!-Remarkably large volume of artists and music selection to satisfy the pickiest audiophiles.-Local syncing allows you to easily add any music from your personal collection on your PC onto your phone via wifi almost seamlessly.Cons:-Programming team behind the app grows progressively ""dummer"" with each update, by which I mean they have a tendency for gutting out small quality-of-life features (like controlling title size in the desktop app).-Local syncing may require some ""massaging"" to get working at times, if you're not particularly tech savvy this can be a real dilemma.-Will eat through your phones internal storage in no time, however my provider (Virgin Mobile) offers unlimited music streaming and I get good enough coverage to never worry about buffering.Conclusion:I'm very impressed with the quality of service I get from my 10$/mo premium and can't imagine living without it (throwback to the Limewire days anyone?).  Some of the prior updates smoothed out the layout, but at the cost of functionality in some minor areas, but not enough for me to knock down a star.  Having the ability to quickly and easily sync local mp3s to my phone without the same inclusive barriers that I've come to expect from Apple products feels like a God send!  5 out of 5, I highly recommend it!"

60152,"Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"I like it.   It's a pretty good app.  The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed.  It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity (to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps), and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again.  But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just ""I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists"", but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites, I couldn't find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like ""Lady of Shallot"", which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."

60154,"Spotify",2017-01-18,5,"Helped me find new amazing music   Spotify is an amazing app if you are wanting to listen to music. You can set up your own playlists and organize them the way you please or listen to playlists Spotify has already created! They can give you song choices from songs you already listen to too, but! There's a tiny but. (haha) On most mobile devices, you can only listen to the music on shuffle, which is great when you don't know which song to choose or you just want to listen to it all, but it's not when there's one in particular that you want to hear. Other than that, amazing music app. So thankful I got it, it's helped me find some new amazing music that has become my favorite 😊"

The premium version is the best $10 a month I can possibly spend.  I wish I had a dollar for all the money I spent on cassettes and CDs back in the day, whew...

When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on  - if i stay on it a second too long.  THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before.  This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!!  The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love.  It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's.  i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or  solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately.  i am frustrated over that.Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)"

Now I wish to get another month, but I don't have a credit card and was trying to see if I didn't have to go to the store for a card again. Five stars if it would allow me to pay through Amazon.The free trial is alright. You can get a bunch of music and create playlists. An ad comes up about every half hour. Not too shabby."

You can find over 1,000,000 records/tracks and I'm not lying!You can also share your playlist and you can even save songs that you like by touching a song and then touch the plus sign.There is a lot of different music genres like Rap,Country,Deep Web,R&B, And Emo but emo sucks so dont listen to it or you will kill yourself but I highly Recommend this app.SPOTIFY IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN PANDORA!!"

It will always be there.  Same goes with any othe playlists I create.  I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal.  I think $9.99 a month is a little over priced, since I could get Prime with all that comes with it for under $100.  But  I will want to download eventually, so when I'm not so broke, I'll be investing in it."

The only learning curve is the many search and save options.....but that is why you will love it. The free version makes me wonder who would need to pay for more. I prefer streaming to downloading!"

I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far.

60253,"Spotify",2016-01-08,5,"Superior app   This app has changed how I use my Kindle Fire. I basically only download apps that are free and broadly used, and Spotify is simply the best of the best. Spotify lets you try a week of their premium version free without asking nosy and annoying questions. Use the app to discover new and old music, it is so much fun. Although their library is not necessarily universally inclusive, the music quality is quite excellent and the software is easy to navigate  I like to make my own playlists and also just to play specific artists' large backlogs on Shuffle. Highly recommended, this will probably be your most used app - yes, even the free version. I am so glad they made a version for Kindle Fire."

Downloads continue to randomly disappear, forcing people to have to download again and again (a process that takes ages if you have lots of tracks). Also, they are lousy at updating new music sections for less popular genres (e.g., Reggae). It has other functionality issues, too. All of them seem eminently fixable, yet they're never fixed."

You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)With Spotify!1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)!4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it!(You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner!  Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)"
60304,"Spotify",2016-12-28,5,"RECOMMENDED   This app is the best music app ever. If you get premium you can skip songs and listen without internet!!! This app is really recommend and you should try it. You could also log in into two devices and connect them and it's amazing. It's ok if you don't have premium cause everything will be free but you have a limit of skipping songs and you would need internet. There are over 1 million songs and it's AWESOME"

This is the greatest music station ever. You can build your own radio, 1000's of German albums and from over every country in the world.  If you classical fantastic. I also love 60's music form America. You will love this station. I promise it. 7 days are free, or you can pay 3.99 this is word it. It is a great company."

60323,"Spotify",2017-06-27,3,"Nice app ... paid version okay for Classical Music   I'm a classical music enthusiast and hate most music apps for their inability to treat multi-movment classical works in their entirety. At least the paid version of spotify let's me turn off ""shuffle"" so I can play whole albums in proper track sequence. Same for playlists I create.Information on the pieces is sadly without detail, generally not including all of composer, conductor, and performer."

He also has a kindle fire HD, and we played no money for his. It's a fantastic app, worth even five dollars, but it's an even better deal because it's completely FREE!!!!!!"

My Spotify updated, and now I have to listen to everything on shuffle. Now, I don't have premium, so when I skip lots of songs, there are lots of ads. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but it sucks. Oh, you want to listen to Girls & Boys (or any song)? Shuffle. Search for a song you need to add to your music? Shuffle! Now, aside from this minor difficulty, the app is the best thing. Great work Spotify!"

So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized.

60387,"Spotify",2015-02-01,5,"One of the best music players you can get for free   I use spotify all the time, especially when I'm studying. I always am happy with the music it suggests and I feel that it does a lot better job of guessing what kind of music I like to listen to than Pandora and other music apps. It kinda sucks that you have to get premium which is about twenty bucks a month to turn off ads and to download music off of the app, but that's about the same price other music apps charge and with spotify you get some extra perks for your money. Great app overall."

On normal class headphones it is good."
60439,"Spotify",2016-02-02,4,"pretty good   I love this app I use it everyday my only problem with it is that at first you can only shuffle you can't choose the song and it has to be online or you can't listen to it offline without buying Premium. I don't know if it happened to anyone else but after I had it for awhile it allowed me to choose the song I want to listen to but I am very happy with this fact. Other than the things I mentioned I loved this app"

Then I told him one day how much I enjoy it and he told me &#34;oh, I don't even use Pandora anymore, Spotify is much better.&#34; So I tried it and have to agree. My ONLY issue with this free application (I haven't upgraded yet) is that any station I listen to seems to repeat several songs...but overall, I really enjoy it."

It's a great place for finding those old songs that you haven't heard in years as well as the newest music out there. You can save your playlist to your computer to play while online. If you go with Premium you can take some of your music with you and play it offline on your portable devices. It's a great music site."

60446,"Spotify",2015-12-03,4,"Spotify is a very good free app   I'm using Free Spotify andI like it alot. It stays more true to the genre or artist you choose. This was a real problem with iheart, but in all fairness it's been awhile since I used that app. Pandora used to shut down all the time saying something about getting eaten by a bear. So you'd have to keep going back to the computer to let them know you were still listening."
60452,"Spotify",2017-04-24,5,"Amazing!   My dad got me premium, and I've been using it for over a year! Works great, took a while to get used to when I first switched from amazon prime, but other then that, it really works!"
60456,"Spotify",2017-09-01,4,"Wonderful!!   Spotify is a wonderful free music app that I enjoy very much. I can create my own playlists and also listen to others. Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. That's not a ridiculous asking price I'm just too cheap.  I thoroughly enjoy this app!"
60459,"Spotify",2017-06-24,5,"Love it... Can't wait to upgrade!   Nothing to smile about. The 9.99 price...per month.  Not worth it.

Why does the logo look like a... Nevermind."

60487,"Spotify",2017-01-16,5,"Spotify   For home use, Spotify is hands-down the best service out there. Not so much so on the go because of a lack of selectability of your artist's songs and albums.

If you do not like commercials the upgrade is the way to go and the cost is not prohibitive.

All your favorite songs, albums, and all music that Spotify is able to get their hands on for free. FORGET paying $1.99 per song. For mobile devices, as long ass you have WiFi you have Spotify without using data. And with premium you can be wiout WiFi and without the data loss. I personally that no its amazing."

60639,"Spotify",2016-12-22,5,"Used daily   I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"

Louder too than Prime.We got the trial subscription for $1/3 months and $7 / mo thereafter. worth it."
60670,"Spotify",2014-12-27,5,"A great app to use every day!   I downloaded this app about 6 months ago and I immediately bought the premium version. It has nearly every artist and song (minus Taylor swift) and the new songs are released here as well. If you go premium, you can add songs to a playlist and make it offline, which downloads the songs so you can listen to them when not connected to WiFi. Also if you're in college, you get a discount on going premium. Overall this is a great music app and definitely worth your time."

Or any phone or table or whatever. It should let us listen off of internet connection. I mean I got this app for me to listen to music. It should at least let me listen off internet connection. But in other words I highly recommend this music app!!!"

60739,"Spotify",2014-08-27,3,"Good - Could Be Great with a Little Work   Spotify is the music player of choice for my entire family. Tap into a vast amount of music with this app. We love for the Spotify platform.However:This app really needs to be revisited as tablets, phones, and non-traditional operating systems (i.e. Chromebooks and Linux) become more prevalent and users begin to use these devices as their primary access to the internet. There are features that are unavailable with this app which make playlist management cumbersome at best. It seems that if you are going to fully utilize the amazing Spotify service you need to have a Windows (or maybe Apple? - I am not an apple user) machine and a copy of the local software."
60744,"Spotify",2017-11-08,5,"Better than my own song library   This app works so well, I'll never pay for another song again."
60746,"Spotify",2015-01-01,4,"Great app but a couple of tweaks could go a long way   I love this app (and Spotify in general) but I guess the thing that continually drives me crazy is that there is no way to properly sort by album name (the album's tab sorts by artists and then by album). I know it sounds nitpicky, but it's one of things I come across all the time and just grates!"

60753,"Spotify",2016-02-16,5,"Awesome   This is an awesome app and I love it! I can use anywhere (when you have premium)  and yopu can search artists and artist radios. Yo can even listyen to 80s or 90s music on it! My first thoughts when I got Spotify were &#34;Whoa, how have I never heard of this before!!?&#34; You van also broadcast it onto other devices and sterile without an aux cord!"
60755,"Spotify",2016-04-03,4,"Use this daily   I wish you could organize your individual playlists in an order you want like you can on desktop. Whenever I create a new playlist, my main starred playlist (which I use most) gets pushed all the way to the bottom. :(Otherwise love this app. It makes my commute so much better and it is a good price."

But lately, when I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it gives me an ad within two songs. All the time. The ads have increased tremendously and I don't know what's changed.  I know I'm using the free app, but it's ridiculous that they tell me I'm getting 30 minutes of ad free music and then they play an ad after the next song or two"
60808,"Spotify",2016-05-30,4,"Nice, I guess.   This is one of my favorite apps. I love/need my music, and the fact that I can play it in the background is great. However, what's not fun is the fact that I got logged out in a different country, and can't log back in. I listen to music with this app every day, and this is a pretty big deal for me. I'm still in that country, and if you could fix this, I'd give it 5 stars."
60815,"Spotify",2017-03-19,5,"Freedom without restrictions   I love that Spotify suggests other music Artists to match the music genre chosen, and allows you to browse through the suggested Artists' music via Singles, Album, or Collaboration and place it in your own created Playlist or one already generated."

We subscribed to the family package but are rethinking our decision.  We do not like that we can not filter the  music on our kid's tablets.  We also have to be careful when playing music in the house.  I have checked online and there are years worth of complaints about this same thing.  Why hasn't Spotify fixed this?"

60857,"Spotify",2016-04-12,5,"BEST MUSIC APP EVER   Way better than Pandora. With Pandora, you just listen to ""stations"". However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to "" download"" the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."
60859,"Spotify",2015-11-30,5,"Hands down my favorite app   Spotify is definitely my most used app; I use it multiple times a day. I pay for premium which is worth every penny to me. It's super easy to search for any song (even the most obscure), curate amazing playlists, and  save songs you Shazam. The radio feature is way better than Pandora and their existing playlists in the Browse section are pretty decent. Also love that I can follow my friend's playlists."

I like that your music continues to play when you go into other apps and even when you turn off your device. The reason it is not 5 stars is because it stops playing randomly sometimes, and you can't play in an order you want. But other than that it is a great music app."
60889,"Spotify",2015-09-17,5,"obsessed!!   Absolutely looooooooove this app. I listen to it in the morning, in the car, at work, before I go go bed. And what I love is that I get to create my own playlists. I don't have to worry about skipping songs or totally feeling my playlist and then.....blah! Nope. Never my issue. I even have playlists for my kids (edited versions of radio hits too!). I'm always recommending this app to everyone and have forced a few of my friends to get it!! Love it!"
60890,"Spotify",2016-01-14,4,"Great   Good I like it because it has music any type you want and it still plays when you get out of the app like right now I'm listening to music from it while writing this."
60899,"Spotify",2015-02-22,5,"works seamlessly   Syncs to all devices easily. Intuitive design makes it easy to create playlists and organize your music.  I like their radio function better than pandora, less repetition of liked songs. Only unable to find a very few artists.  Coming from the school of record digging and hunting, this makes underground music almost TOO easy to find!  A whole new school and Spotify is the best way to listen to music in the modern world."

Great except for not being able to move songs up or down in play lists (or see play times) from android tablets.  Seems odd that these features work with my old windows 7 laptop but are not avaliable with a new tablet or phone?

Great variety os playlists, national or international, great sound quality, shows you what songs are in the playlist.The premium version is great also, letting you choose exactly what song you want to listen to, instead of going random on to playlist and waiting for it to show up. It also lets you mark some songs as ""available offline"", so you can listen to your favorite songs anytime at all."
60974,"Spotify",2017-08-29,4,"Good music service   I like the suggestions feature of Spotify, it has exposed me to music that otherwise I would have not ever listened to. However, their selection is not even close to include all genres and artists"

I would have to say that the downside to this app is that if you don't have the premium account, then you can't listen to what ever song you want. Also, you can't listen offline unless you have premium. Other than that, I would recommend this app Ito everyone"

I'd give it 5 stars, but only giving 4 because they don't always have the music you want.  Like, I'll go to add a particular song to my playlist, but Spotify doesn't have it.

Only one flaw with this on the kindle version vs. the app on my android tablet is that it will look like you have added a song/saved a song but it does not in fact save at all. I've had to go back and forth from my droid to kindle.This is basically exactly like google play and cost the same to go add free."

That being said, there are quite a few tools that enable to listen to and enjoying the music you want. It's a great tool, just hard to use."

61233,"Spotify",2017-10-13,5,"Great app!!!   The thing that impressed me the most about this was the ease of use.  I also liked O could put in the singer's name and hear only them.  You don't have to listen to music that you dont know, you just listen to the music you asked for."

Just ephing stops, whether it be in the middle of the song, going to another song, doesn't matter. It just stops. When I go to press play it does nothing. How do you expect me to buy premium if it just stops? I rather just waste the 300 or so hours ot'll take for me to download all of my personal music on to my phone then deal with this crappy, crap."

61306,"Spotify",2017-06-05,5,"Very nice app   Wide range of artists and easy to set up. The app asks which artists you like and creates playlists based on your answers. In my case the playlists are on target. I have the free version and the ads are low key and unobtrusive. I recommend it."

This is what we waited for people. At first this app only let you listen to the radio unless you bought the premium version, but now you get an almost unlimited music selection for free without as many adds (only about 1 or 2 every 5-6 songs) There is still some stuff that needs worked out, like navigation and display, but it is well worth it!"
61346,"Spotify",2017-03-16,5,"Cool   Its great free music online but it would be great if on specific days or months there would be free to listen to if off line and no adds but besides that its great"

Spotify is an awesome music app which allows you to do stuff pandora doesn't usually allow you to do. You can make your own playlist and if your using a kindle or a computer you can play any music you want as much as you want.Though the only downside is you can't download it for offline if your not a premium member you can get the best quality if your a premium."
61508,"Spotify",2015-10-23,4,"love this app   So far this has been the best way for me to listen to music. I like that the have the offline mode for premium members, it definitely saves my data when I'm on the go. The only downside that I've found is the lack of songs available for certain artist but that is to be expected."
61511,"Spotify",2015-01-06,4,"Good   It would be beneficial if the phone had done way to see the music that is local to the device so that it could be used in 3rd party alarm apps. It would also be nice if there was a way to auto play a playlist or resume the playlist/radio on asp open."
61513,"Spotify",2017-06-24,4,"Curate your daily soundtrack!   Great platform for curating a play list and discovering new artists!"
61514,"Spotify",2017-07-24,3,"ok, idk   This app is the same as Pandora. I think you can listen free without WiFi, but you need a premium account to do that .& I'm pretty sure that costs MONEY. SO I STILL LIKE IT But u won't get to enjoy it for free. That is the.ONLY reason I downloaded this app because I thought I could listen for the $free.99 (without WiFi).  it is a little tricky at first. It slow too."

61526,"Spotify",2016-08-11,3,"I love spotify but...   I love it but i live out in the country and i cant use it because i dont have internet. It sucks that you have to have wifi to use this amazing app"
61530,"Spotify",2015-03-17,1,"If it worked it would be great   Randomly stops working. Will tell me there is no internet connection when there absolutely is one. Often will say 'Track not available' for no reason, even though it is on a playlist or actually stored on the device, and I do have an internet connection anyway. Often songs will say it is playing but there is no sound. Some songs just won't play, ever, no matter what. Sometimes songs are missing from an album. Huh? The 50% of the time Spotify works the way it should I like it, but the other 50% of the time is beyond frustrating. I blame the Kindle's terrible proprietary software for the problem as much as the app itself, though.Return your Kindle asap, buy a real tablet, download the regular Android version of Spotify that will actually work."
61531,"Spotify",2017-04-08,5,"spodify is amazing!   Spodify is a really awesome app. It lets you pick from tons of music stations, and you can also make your own. And if you listen to it on your computer you can pick any song you want to listen to. I really recommend it to anyone who loves music!"

In the meantime I keep getting $9.99 for the last four months and I've nothing to show for it.. I don't listen to the station. I tried it couple of times and wasn't impress. I use Pandora. So I would be real careful about using this no support app. I have brought a radio station that isn't user friendly mostly heavy rock offer. That's all I know and they do withdraw funds whenever they feel like. What does a music app have that Special for ten dollars, nothing! BEWARE$$$$$"

61579,"Spotify",2014-11-30,5,"fantastic   I have tried lots of other music apps and none of them are as good as this one. It does what Pandora does plus you can look up other songs without limited skips. It is wonderful."

What I wonder is why can  easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money, but I do not like this feature.
