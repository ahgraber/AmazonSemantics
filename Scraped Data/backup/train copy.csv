2,"Amazon",2016-06-30,3,"In order for this to be of value you must use it daily or it's just not worth payhing a year in advance for it.   Lots of product but I just didn't use it enough to justify spending over a $100 dollars a year on this.  Plus they make you pay a year in advance and you can't pay monthly which sucks.  Maybe if they started charging monthly I'd sign up again.  The free 2 days shipping on products was goo thought.  But I never watched a movie or listened to a song on Amazon."

11,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Not bad considering its free!   Decent service. Love the fact that it's bundled w/ Prime. Makes Primes an even greater bargain! The service itself is.... useable... The music selection is not as vast as other services and the audio quality for some reason is only so-so. Love the playlists and the ability to download music for offlilne streamline those are must have for any music streaming services. Hopefully artists and content will increase with time. Impossible to give a bad review to free service to Prime subscribers but I wouldn't mind paying an extra few bucks a month if the issues noted above were addressed."

23,"Amazon",2016-12-02,5,"BETTER THAN ITUNES!   AMAZON MUSIC is so easy and is much better than ITUNES in many ways. The only downfall is that my CHRISTIAN artists do not do as much with Amazon Music and other than that...I downgraded my ITUNES account and am doing Amazon now. We are going to buy the Echo Dot and love the whole Alexa thing...better than Siri!"

53,"Amazon",2016-03-23,1,"BB no longer supported   I always gave great credit to Amazon for doing its part to make Android apps available for the BlackBerry OS. No longer. I have reason to own a BB10 OS device, which does have the ability to run Android apps, but only if the vendor allows the app to be downloaded, which in this case Amazon no longer allows. I'm dumping my Amazon Prime subscription and giving the money to Spotify."
57,"Amazon",2016-11-15,4,"Works for me!   Works well on my smart phone. Not comparing it to itunes or any other provider As a stand alone  product, I use it with Audio CDs purchased and I can download with prime in 5 seconds. I use it daily no measure of sound quality, etc.Simply works for me. Use phone, open Amazon player, hear my music. Grateful!"
62,"Amazon",2017-04-21,4,"Four Stars   love it"
66,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Best streaming music service I've found   It is lacking many features for sorting or searching for duplicates, etc.  But I'm loving having such a huge library included with my Prime account.  I look forward to continuing to develop the apps to have more features I'd like to see.  I've tried several other streaming services and have not been satisfied at all from constantly crashing my devices to not syncing between computer and devices.  Been using Prime Music for weeks now with no issues at all."

92,"Amazon",2016-04-07,5,"Works great now.   It used to work great until the OS update. I hope they fix it soon. The update makes the app useless."
95,"Amazon",2013-09-20,5,"Bye Bye iTunes   I'm loving using my SamsungS3 phone with Amazon MP3 app + RunDouble's C25K app.  It's great to be able to add new songs to my training play list without having to doc to my PC; keeps my training runs fresh.Finally time to retire my iPod Shuffle and the original C25K podcasts."
98,"Amazon",2017-05-03,5,"SO FAR SO GOOD,   AT A PRESENT TIME MY NUMBER ONE SUPPLIER."
103,"Amazon",2015-12-18,3,"Love the application   Love the application, though I grant only 3, because by mistake I deleted the mp3 folder for the music included with prime, and the application didn't give me the opportunity to download them again, so no off-line library at the moment because of that, the stations is awesome because it's like have a lot of radio stations without commercial breaks and dumb comments every now and then.. just music 24/7"
106,"Amazon",2014-07-03,1,"I know you are not listening, BUT   For all of us that have been using Amazon MP3 since the first Android devices came out, this is a major disappointment.  First you snub us with instant video, then you take away tablet support for music and replace it with a beta quality.  This after we have already spent significant money buying music from you.  Sure i can switch to a new service, but i really had no plans too before this, and really did not want to spend the time.  Its hard to understand what your issue is with Android, i am positive that you could develop whatever you want.  I wish you would have never showed up on Android, that way I could have built a library on another service to begin with.  Very dissapointed.  Will have to use the pre-installed version until i can switch my wife and i to something else.  Who would have guessed a pre-installed app would come in handy.  Good luck with your new fire products.  Looks like i will be buying stock in the first amazon alternative that comes along, cause this alienation of such a large customer base makes no business since whatsoever.  You are trying to crush Google, but pushing people to them.  You could have owned the entire android ecosystem pretty much with prime music and video and apps."
108,"Amazon",2017-03-15,3,"Three Stars   Liked it better before changes."
114,"Amazon",2014-08-29,1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, you know the rest.   Although, I must admit the number of albums seems quite astonishing, I'm not satisfied for a few reasons. First and foremost: their marketing and cheap gimmick tactics to increase member subscriptions. Signing up for a free trial membership is usually something I'm wary about, but I took the bait this time and low and behold, after one month of use, I was charged a YEAR subscription renewal fee! Most companies will just charge for the next month and that seems reasonable, but surely this is a ploy to increase revenues and artificially inflate membership while skirting customer satisfaction because at the end of the day they bank on folks like myself simply forgetting to cancel their 'free' trial membership. Numero dos: while the music I've listened to has been great, and I enjoy their offline access to albums, they do not have any of the simple user-friendly displays like some other music counterparts (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc. etc.). If you're listening on a web browser, it's constantly being opened into new tabs and nothing is intuitive. Also, with no filter to search prime music (when clicking on other music that might interest you) could lead to folks accidentally purchasing products they thought were free. Number three: after resigning to the fact that I purchased this membership, I tried to watch some programs on my tablet and low and behold! Does not work with most Android products. Or Chromecast (to my knowledge). Now that I've purchased the year subscription, I'll certainly give this a shot. But fool me once Amazon, shame on you. You have one year to win me back."
116,"Amazon",2014-08-02,1,"Uninstalled, because it is of no use to me anymore   Unlike others, I don't want to download all my music onto my phone. That would be impossible! I own a LOT of music, and when this app was Amazon MP3, I was easily convinced that I should upload all of my digital music to Amazon, and then I could play it wfrom my phone where ever I was (as long as I had a good internet connection, of course). Got a new phone, and I downloaded the new Amazon Music app. What it shows as 'Cloud'  music is only about 1% of the music I store on Amazon's cloud servers. I can't really review any other feature of the app, because my music is not accessible. I called Amazon, and was told they were working on it. A couple of days later there was an update, which did not fix this problem. Amazon can add all the features it wants, but if I cannot play the music I already own, the app is useless to me."
119,"Amazon",2016-04-28,5,"So very satisfied..   If you have prime, use this!  My musical tastes are vast.  If you sometimes vary far off the beaten path your needs will be met and expanded.So very satisfied... nothing is quite as good as being introduced to music you may like and having them hit the nail on the head.Just make sure you are on wifi when you hit a pocket of awesome tunes."
128,"Amazon",2017-05-29,5,"Music App is BOMBIN!   It's awesome to be able to take my music anywhere!!"
130,"Amazon",2016-09-25,5,"Great solid app with tons of features   Solid app for music streaming and downloading. The best part is that there are constant updated virtual stations and playlist that are spot on. One of my most used apps."
132,"Amazon",2015-09-05,5,"Blown away!   Huge 3dg and staind fan! From the second I listened to it I could hear bits and pieces of them but this is not those bands! This is much harder than 3dg and more composed then staind. I haven't bought an album in 5 years...this was worthy enough to buy and it's been on repeat since I got it! Incredible band and I'm stoked on their music! If you like hard rock with small amounts of metal and insanely good lyrics...buy this album!"
134,"Amazon",2017-04-29,4,"Nice Mix   Great its part of Prime"
135,"Amazon",2015-04-30,3,"COULD be a 5 star...   I loved this at first. I was excites thinking FINALLY something better than Pandora! But day one songs stopped half way through to load like there was a connection issue each time I left home. I was using 4G so I don't get that. since then, it's happening more and more frequently. Whether I'm home or not, on Wi-Fi or 4G. Still keeps stopping mid-song to either load or the app just crashes altogether. It has potential but I'm disappointed I had to go back to Pandora."
139,"Amazon",2017-04-30,5,"Best Music App Ever!!!   This is my favorite music app and I have it on my Fire TV, Fire Tablet and Android Phone. Recent updates to this app on my Android Phone had me wondering why some of my music was missing, particularly music that I purchased and songs selected for my various playlists. The Amazon Music App updates did not negatively affect my playlists on my Fire TV or Fire Tablet. I discovered that it was Google Play and not Amazon that changed my playlists and eliminated some of my favorite songs. I had to go into Google Play and uninstall and disable the Amazon Music app, so it could only be downloaded from the Amazon web site. There were many negative reviews of this app on the Google Play site and now I realize it is because of the changes that Google Play makes to the app on installation and updates. The Amazon Music app will not properly function when downloaded by Google Play. When I installed this app again from the Amazon web site, it was perfect in form and function. No stalling and stopping and no missing songs."
149,"Amazon",2016-01-15,5,"Amazon Music App is the Best In Its Class.   I rate Amazon Music app higher than its two top-rated competitors' apps -- Google Play Music and Audials.  Brilliantly designed user interface that is easy to use and navigate.  Immense library of music.  Also, Amazon Music app works great on Fire tablets and real Android devices, such as Samsung mobile devices.  Amazon nailed it dead-on with its music app.  Woot, Woot, Woot for Amazon!"
150,"Amazon",2017-01-01,4,"Can't remove only the duplicate songs.   Very cool, but there's no way to delete duplicate songs without having to delete all of the copies of the song instead of just the extra ones."
161,"Amazon",2016-01-21,5,"Great.   Have used it ""on the go"". Works great, choice is vast, service is clear and... well, I use it a lot."
174,"Amazon",2017-06-15,5,"Five Stars   Pretty awesome access to tons of music included with my Prime membership."
178,"Amazon",2016-10-17,1,"I used to use Amazon music with my Prime account ...   I used to use Amazon music with my Prime account. Now Amazon won't install on my phone, so I can't. Until it gets fixed I can't give it more than one star."
189,"Amazon",2016-01-17,5,"Animal need MORE MUUUUUSIC!   Gotta love the music! Kinda sad that songs I consider my favorites, that really shouldn't be rare or hard to find, are amiss from this app... oh well,  the pros must definitely outweigh the cons."
190,"Amazon",2014-12-08,4,"is not that bad   The Good: prime members get a lot of free music, buying song is easy, the quality is also very good, like the addition of the lyrics.The Bad: sometimes it crashes, I can't edit playlist without interrupting the music, and I saw that the app drains a lot of battery comparing with other music players. And is a little confusing at first when trying to organize your music.I still gave a 4 star cause of the free music for prime members. Is it wasn't for that I'll give it a 3."
191,"Amazon",2014-10-04,3,"Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads   Amazon Prime Music is a good services for digital downloads. The Lady Gaga Artpop album I bought was half the price of Google Play app. I also noticed that Google Play matched the price when I went back to compare their price. However, Amazon Prime gift cards in the stores start at $25. ""Whew"", "" Wow""! It's a high price to pay for one album if that's all you need. I don't have a credit card and am on a limited income. What happened to the days of the $10 iTunes card? Overall though it's quite good!"
194,"Amazon",2017-08-01,5,"Five Stars   Easy to use.  Great to have access just about everywhere."
195,"Amazon",2017-03-16,4,"It's okay   I enjoy it"
204,"Amazon",2017-03-20,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
205,"Amazon",2014-07-21,4,"Great, but want more access!   I love amazon Prime Music. The only reason why I give it four stars is because I can't access it on my other devices and also not with our Fire TV device."
210,"Amazon",2014-08-18,3,"Spotify is still a better deal.   I like what Amazon is planning on doing with Prime Music, however the selection is still scarce.  Secondly it feels like, with Prime Music, they (Amazon) still want you to purchase music.  If you like buying albums of a whole artist go you'll like this, but if you like to pick and choose go with Spotify instead.  Also, if you like finding obscure, less known or independent artists on Amazon you're going to run into problems.  Seriously, at  $10 dollars a month ( $5 for students first time) Spotify is a far superior product."
213,"Amazon",2014-09-07,2,"Another bad marketing choice by Amazon dumped over the head of its Prime members as a ""bonus""!?!   I'm a Spotify user, having used Rhapsody for years before that. I don't buy my music to listen to. Given that, let's just say that Amazon Prime's new music addition is really next to worthless. As most of us Prime members have come to realize, the number of products covered by the Prime membership increasingly smaller and is always in flux, at its best. In some cases, it's almost laughable. Now Amazon want to tell us they've added value to the membership by featuring these incidental cuts from a tiny minority of albums that one can hear for ""free."" Not to mention one needs their Amazon Music with Prime  Music app! This is largely a piece of trash. Try getting it off your device once you've installed it! Surprise, it's part and parcel of the increasingly restrictive OS of the Kindle Fire now (don't know about others). What's more, there's no way to opt out of its constantly being loaded into memory.Come on Amazon, isn't it time that you give your Prime customers some credit for choosing Prime? MUST we make _exclusive_ use of every product you offer us as members? It's becoming much more an indentured servitude than a perks membership. Even more, with every product you become more restrictive than before. Do you consider us mindless fools? Really? Gee thanks."
214,"Amazon",2014-07-12,4,"Updated review, using Chrome everything works!   This has not went well for me. Keep getting prompts to download current adobe flash player, already have it. Try to download music importer app, error #5020 'Not connected to net"" odd, since I am. Contacted amazon, waited a day to hear back, then they called me, no help. I waited all day for a call back, no help. She told me to contact my anti-virus company, I have AVG, and I have allowed adobe and importer to download. She said she would call back today, have not heard from them. It's a shame because of the amount of music available."
218,"Amazon",2015-07-09,5,"Amazon is Great!   Streaming works great with the echo of my own library. I don't have prime as a buyer but rather an affiliate because my daughter added me, but I would guess it would be as good a streaming experience as my own library which has the limit of 250 songs in the Amazon Cloud in it plus the ability to add the songs to your library. I haven't a single complaint when it comes to Amazon. They do business the way a business should be run."
219,"Amazon",2014-11-10,2,"Very disappointed, considering looking elsewhere for a cloud service/music player   Regularly crashes and gives errors, I've talked to tech support numerous times, each time it appears to be better for a couple days and goes back to being horribly glitchy and unwieldy.  Sometimes I'll play a song from my device, not even on the cloud, and it will take 10 minutes to load.  Other times, I'll open it and it will immediately crash about 50 times until I can finally start to use it.  I've had this for about a year and had to uninstall/reinstall it probably 30 times because of issues."
227,"Amazon",2017-05-01,5,"My Music   I love my music on my phone while work outside."
232,"Amazon",2015-06-05,3,"Clunky UI, buggy, and uninformative   CLUNKY! Yes, it does the trick, but sometimes I get confused as to where to look for things. Want to see albums by a certain artist? OK, you can do that, but Amazon will give you no release date information on that album. Let's say you're not all that familiar with an artist but want to download or buy their latest album. Pretty tricky to do unless you have Google handy, also!It's also buggy. Several times, I've been told that my Prime tracks have been 100% downloaded. Then, when I'm on the road with no available wifi, the tracks are not listed under my Offline tracks- only under my Cloud tracks! This has happened on more than a couple occasions.Also, when I'm listening to Amazon music and doing other things on my phone such as web browsing, Amazon music will just shut itself down in the background- and this is on a 2014 Moto X, not some ancient smartphone.The interface is just not friendly at all. If I wasn't already paying for Prime, I'd switch back to Spotify in a heartbeat (not that its UI is that much better, but its selection of subscription-based music definitely is)."
233,"Amazon",2014-08-25,3,"doesn't always work   I have used this app for a couple of years and had no problems with the app till the last upgrade a couple of months ago when the app refused to work on my galaxy s3 after a couple of calls with Amazon Tec support a solution came no closer. I have since upgrade my phone and low and behold all of the Amazon apps work once again. I find the lack of resolve on Amazon tec support rather troubling. All though I was promised to be kept in the loop I never was, not that it matters much anymore since I have a different phone"
236,"Amazon",2014-12-27,5,"Buy An Amazon Prime Membership!!  NOW!!   If you don't see an Amazon Prime Membership paying off, just for the free two day shipping alone, then Do It For The Music!! You will Never have a lack of music that you love, no matter what style, genre, or artist. It's All Here!!  And, that's not even mentioning what's available if you have Amazon Fire TV Boxes, or Amazon Fire TV Stick!! At $99.00 per year, that comes out to $8.25 per month!! You can finally say Goodbye to Cable TV, Satellite TV, etc........FOREVER!!!  I Did!!"
239,"Amazon",2016-10-02,4,"I like it. Wish there were more choices   I like it.  Wish there were more choices.  The selection is limited"
247,"Amazon",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars   very satisfied with this product"
248,"Amazon",2015-12-08,5,"Love the free music on my pc   Love the free music on my pc. Even got it to stream to my Ouya to listen on the surround sound in the living room"
252,"Amazon",2016-01-08,3,"Music buffers, and stalls   For some reason the music buffers even when not streaming from the cloud. Also, it doesn't transition quickly from song to song. There have been many times that I thought my Playlist had ended, but it was just silent due to switching to another song. There is a decent amount of free music. I'm not sure if the ability to use it ends when my Prime membership ends or not."
256,"Amazon",2016-01-09,3,"good, but could be better.   The search function could be more user friendly, and it would be awesome if you could organize your library by genre, so if you want to hear only a specific type of music, you  ould do that. I understand that there are playlists for this, but the amount of songs you can add to each list is limited to like 60. Its better suited to ppl who dont have as much music on it."
257,"Amazon",2016-09-28,4,"Wow!   Totally Great"
260,"Amazon",2017-07-23,4,"Four Stars   like it"
272,"Amazon",2017-11-03,2,"Only if you are dedicated to the Amazon ecosystem   Spotify is easier to use"
274,"Amazon",2015-12-04,5,"Love love love Amazon!   I absolutely love Amazon Prime and Amazon music and Amazon shopping and anything Amazon... Keep it up Amazon!"
276,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"Update sucks   This new update will not play music if no cell or Wi-Fi is available. My music is on my device and all I get is the rotating circle looking for service. However, I can play music through Google player, or the device's music player.I didn't even know about the lack of storage on my SD card. Every so often, I get a glitch and need to reset my phone. I should not have to re-download all my music. Before, I would pull my SD card, reset phone, and re-mount the SD card  continue listening to music.Not happy!"
278,"Amazon",2017-05-08,5,"Love my Amazon Music!   Amazon music is easy to use and I can find anything I want to listen to on it. I'm so much happier since I started my service. Since starting it I've dropped my Sirius account and Pandora. Strictly Amazon music for this girl from now on!"
279,"Amazon",2015-08-15,3,"I love the idea of one place like prime to do ...   I have Rhapsody now, so that is what I have to compare it to. I have to pay a subscription for both prime and rhapsody. The difference is, rhapsody is easier and I don't have to pay additional for a lot of the songs. The easier to use would be to much to write. I love the idea of one place like prime to do videos/music/food(way to expensive!)/Shopping but the price and ease needs to get better on prime."
296,"Amazon",2015-10-07,1,"USA issued Credit Card.... seriously?   Music Collection under prime could be better, nevertheless i am happy with it because i don't need my spotify subscription--edit--After enjoying the app for about a week it got disabled because i don't have a USA issued credit card... i wonder why my money and international credit card is good to pay for the prime subscription but not good enough to use/buy music with this app..."
297,"Amazon",2016-06-14,5,"Beats Pandora!!!   Beats Pandora! You can go back and listen to a song again, skip unlimited, no commercials/advertisements, and it doesn't stop playing with ""are you still listening?"""
300,"Amazon",2016-01-26,1,"I have yet to figure out what is free and ...   I have yet to figure out what is free and what isn't.  Got really scared off when I downloaded a playlist and it said 60+ songs bought?  Tried reaching out to Amazon but never received any reply.  I am admittedly not much of a tech person, and so far there haven't been any charges.  I deleted the playlist and went back to Pandora which is dummy proof."
304,"Amazon",2016-04-03,1,"One Star   Really? How about flip a switch And let this run on my Shield Tablet."
306,"Amazon",2015-08-31,1,"Disappointed   I am unable to download purchased music to my phone/tablet.  The only way to access is through the internet. I like to use my purchase music as ringtones and things. However, one can listen to the playlist from one's phone/tablet but not the other way.  They call it offline music. Tried to return for a refund but could not find the option.  I can purchase the album and download it that way."
308,"Amazon",2015-10-22,3,"Not impressed.   It's not horrible, but it doesn't have near the music selection that spotify does. It wants to charge you for so much."
309,"Amazon",2017-11-02,1,"One Star   I did not think I would have to give more money to hear the music when I want to."
316,"Amazon",2015-08-26,1,"Worst app and service ever there is never any good ...   Worst app and service ever there is never any good music to download without paying for it. I would be upset but its included in prime."
317,"Amazon",2017-07-19,3,"Three Stars   Does what it says on the tin."
318,"Amazon",2016-10-28,5,"Music for everyone😁!   I listen to a wide variety of music. Amazon has a lot.I absolutely love the fact that it's commercial free.I am overall happy with it.Unlike Slacker and iheart where you are limited in use Amazon music gives you the freedom to enjoy what you want to hear."
324,"Amazon",2016-08-24,3,"Only use it if you already have prime.   Service seriously lacking many popular songs and artists that are available on other services. The stations are not varied enough and they don't sufficiently adapt to your thumbs ups/downs. App is weak as well. It's worth using since I already have Prime, but I wouldn't pay extra for this."
325,"Amazon",2016-03-08,5,"Music Galore   I love this addition and listen almost daily.  Variety is marvelous!"
327,"Amazon",2014-12-31,4,"good- but annowing Prime option screen   my biggest problem with this app is that it continually puts me on a screen wanting me to choose PRIME music. WHY IS THERE NOT AN OPTION TO SAY NO??? I don't have the access to internet that it would need to run it. Some of us don't live in a city where it's everywhere. I live in a rural area and my satellite internet is so much data per month. That's it. So PLEASE give an option to opt out of that without continually being routed back to that screen."
331,"Amazon",2016-09-29,3,"Good but just top pop   It is a good addition to prime but the music is still just top pop of what they want you to hear. I would like more off beat choices"
332,"Amazon",2017-04-05,4,"Only USA   Huge number of songs and type of music"
339,"Amazon",2016-03-24,5,"Very impressive   I have tried many music players like this in the past, and this is by far one of the most impressive ones. It has an easy search function, and is smooth with no ads (if you are prime user I'm assuming). And it saves your recently listened to stations in one easy to find list. All in all I am quite impressed with this product."

Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get ""Exception #151"" and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!"

You have a selection of what you're looking for,  then you get immediate delivery via download,  house can burn your copy and then save the purchase unopened,  if you want. Plus no driving,  store lines or tax, if you're lucky enough to live someplace that doesn't make you pay it."

It has a wide selection but if I can't load the store half the time, how can I access the selection???"

401,"Amazon",2014-08-29,2,"Prime Music Service Review   Considering the cost of a Prime Membership it would be nice to see more mp3 downloads for ""offline"" listening.  It seems to me that having more songs streamed to Prime Members wouldn't cost Amazon all that much more money, especially since most of them are VERY old songs!!!  Also, a few more of the newer recordings, or, compilation albums would be nice."
404,"Amazon",2016-03-08,5,"Love Prime Music   It's one of the best features of Prime. The variety of music that comes as a part of the Prime Music subscription is fantastic. Not everything I want is free, but I haven't found anything yet that cannot be purchased. I listen to it all day at work, when I can, and then crank it up at home on weekends. I love Prime Music."
408,"Amazon",2015-08-14,2,"I *LOVE*Amazon Prime Music, BUT...   I was one of the early Prime subscribers, and generally am more than pleased by Amazon, their products and services, and usually have nothing bad to say about Amazon....However, that having been said, while I do enjoy Amazon Prime Music (APM) I am forced to uninstall it.  It is a HUGE, space-consuming app!  Let me elaborate:  I've had this smart phone for just barely over a year.  I don't download many apps and am very selective and careful about apps I do d/l.  APM is terrible about wasting space needlessly, in one of the folders within APM, I found numerous folders with names such as [500] and [47] and [200], etc.  Within EACH of these numerous folders, I found the EXACT same images of album covers, (many/most of which I never played, viewed, downloaded, etc. - most were from the &#34;Recommended for you&#34; suggestions ubiquitous on Amazon, and the other suggestions, etc.,made by Amazon)  Not only does APM d/l and store numerous copies of the same images & data, there's apparently no mechanism to go back and delete the old unnecessary (space-destroying!) data!  Even after using other apps to go through and delete all the duplicate images & data, the app STILL was taking OVER 1.96[GIGABYTES!] -let me make this perfectly clear here, that is nearly 2.0 Gigabytes, NOT Megabytes!!  WHY ON EARTH DOES AN APP THAT MERELY STREAMS & PLAYS MUSIC &#60;need&#62; TO BE THAT LARGE?!?!?!?!?  This is absolutely RIDICULOUS, I *HOPE* someone at Amazon is reading this and looking into this...With APM installed, I was constantly  receiving messages from my phone that space was critical and some functions may not work.  That was correct, I missed phone calls, could not receive texts, etc., and was unable to update my phone and/or other apps I had installed.  This includes my Android system OS, obviously, and virus/malware protection updates, ... and, just to be clear, this overwhelming space-consumption is WITHOUT ANY downloaded music files, and AFTER having used other apps to clean up all the duplicated and unnecessary files!!!  Completely unacceptable, thus it gone, uninstalled.  When Amazon goes through and rebuilds APM so that it only takes up a REASONABLE amount of space on our phones (which are NOT huge space-storage devices, to begin with!), I will reconsider downloading APM to my phone again!"
409,"Amazon",2017-07-18,3,"Could be more intuitive.   The interface is not as intuitive to use in my opinion.  I have one album downloaded, and I have to search for the album to play in its entirety."

412,"Amazon",2013-12-04,2,"Caused software issues   I had to uninstall this because it caused problems with other software on my computer.  Other programs wouldn't work right and when I uninstalled it, they began working correctly again.  So although it worked, I can't use it on my computer."
418,"Amazon",2011-08-27,5,"best mp3 player, and if it could play drm files it would be perfect   Having my favorite music with me is vital to my enjoyment of the day. It's easy with iphones, but iphones suck, so I really wanted an easy way to put my music on my Android. this app is the answer. not only is it an exceptionally well designed app, but it has very good variety and some extremely nice features that make it superior to itunes (in my opinion. however, being a classical music listener I would love to see a little variety (even though it is already large) in this genre. another problem I have (which is really more to do with Apple) with it is that it can't play files that are drm protected. granted this is a good way to eliminate competition on apples part, but it is exceptionally annoying. this is more or less a perfect app however, and I highly recommend it."
420,"Amazon",2014-12-28,4,"Good Value   Woeks a little quirky when selecting another album to play but it may just me me learning to use it. Good value with the Prime membership."

441,"Amazon",2015-08-06,5,"Perhaps the best   The music selection is outstanding and the access could not be any easier. Th esuggestions are almost always spot on or very close to what I enjoy and prefer. One more reason that I really enjoy my Prime Membership and plan on being a life long member."

455,"Amazon",2014-04-07,1,"Doesn't import everything over very accurately   Disappointed that it messed all my music up when it imported it over from i-tunes - it mixed a lot of the album covers up with the wrong albums and tracks and doesn't import all types of audio files.Also find it a little frustrating to navigate through.The idea is great, but I feel I have wasted my £21.00 yearly subscription and could have spent it better on another product."

When I read amazon was going to raise the prime cost I thought about dropping the service, the addition of the music has made me reconsider. There are so many benefits to prime now I will probably renew in October.  Did you know prime delivered, for free, a college textbook on Sunday via overnight service,  that my daughter needed on Monday. I liked prime for the price. Now I love it thanks to the music."
471,"Amazon",2017-05-02,4,"Needs desktop app   The only thing that this really needs is just a stand alone desktop app (like Spotify), would rather not fire up a web browser each and every time I want to use it."
472,"Amazon",2016-12-22,4,"Careful but good   Is a well organized app. I would like to give it a 5 star but I just noticed that I bought a song by accident.

481,"Amazon",2014-07-23,5,"Love it!   This loads perfectly on my phone and I can listen to the music even when I'm not at my desk or at home.  I enjoy being able to keep up with my music that I listen to in one place."
483,"Amazon",2016-06-15,3,"Its ok   It's ok. Doesn't have all the songs I like, like Spotify does but it's free with prime so I like it. I cancelled Spotify sometimes I wish I didn't."

My wife says that I am stuck in the 70's when it comes to music but I do like 50's and 60's rock and roll too. I have put almost 700 songs in my music library and I ain't done yet. Thanks to my iPhone and my tablet and my awesome Bluetooth speaker I can take my favorite music anywhere. Amazon Prime is worth the cost just for the music and the videos."

509,"Amazon",2011-11-08,5,"unexpectedly became my favorite MP3 player on Android   The main reason I like the Amazon MP3 player is that it has the best fast-forward/rewind controls for long tracks such as podcasts or audio books.  All the other player either skip too-large sections, or otherwise are not workable for long tracks.The ability to access tracks in my cloud is also nice."
515,"Amazon",2016-10-05,1,"Lost all my songs   I was enjoying it, until it wipe off my phone and now I can't download.  I lost all my songs that I purchased"
516,"Amazon",2016-06-15,5,"Not to bad..   Really like it. I just wish they had more music choices in Prime. I've had to buy alot of the songs I like because they weren't listed in Prime."
517,"Amazon",2016-10-31,4,"Good Deal at $3.99 a month for music on the Amazon Echo   Well worth the $3.99 a month for music on our Amazon Echo. I've asked Echo to play some songs I thought it wouldn't have and Amazon Music Unlimited has found every one of them. If you've got an Echo I'd say try it for this price it's a good deal!"
518,"Amazon",2014-07-17,1,"Why isn't there a non-prime version for older phones?   Well with the latest update this app is no longer compatible with my phone. It would be great if the old version were available so I could download and play the music I purchased without having to buy... yet another phone. I understand that the addition of prime music might necessitate an upgrade but locking me out of music I paid for is very disillusioning."
519,"Amazon",2014-06-19,5,"More music than you can listen to in a lifetime!   I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage, so I wasn't too worried about having enough music to listen to.  However, the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites.  I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out.  The catalog from some of the top labels are not available, but it is still an impressive collection!"
520,"Amazon",2017-01-27,5,"Thank Heaven for Amazon Prime and the Music App.   I love the Amazon Music app! I thoroughly enjoy all the music that is right at my fingertips whenever I want.  Makes time spent in the car much more tolerable, chills me out in the evening, etc.  Now I can't imagine being without it."
521,"Amazon",2017-04-15,5,"Five Stars   Love that it includes some free music with prime. I would rather listen and then buy."
522,"Amazon",2016-06-29,2,"it stinks!   I would rather it have gone to my play music app but I didn't have a choice. It took forever to figure out what happened to my downloads. Then I listened which went fine but once I got out, I couldn't find it again. There is no icon. Still haven't found it. I hate this program!"

For Android users there's no options to purchase music like iPhone/iTunes users can.  Get with the times man!"
557,"Amazon",2017-01-21,3,"So so   It works decently but pushes to much for unlimited. Difficult to get music set up when your  wife has primary email on a family account and you're the second email account. Unlike most amazon products it feels like a money grab."

576,"Amazon",2014-07-04,2,"used to like...not so much now   I have used this app for quite some time. It came installed on my phone as Amazon MP3. I was pleased with the selection and being able to download my purchases to my phone and syncing it with other play lists previously created. Now, with it being the prime music, I can no longer sync it. So now I have to use two different apps to listen to music...DISLIKE!!!Amazon- please go back to letting us download to our devices so we can use only 1 playlist!"
578,"Amazon",2015-03-31,2,"Very poorly designed   This app (on a Samsung G4) is very poorly designed.  I still can't figure out how to close the app after I start it.  There is an option (in the app) to clear the cache and this stops the player.  But...why isn't there an option to close.  Also (as others have mentioned) the songs are never actually downloaded.

I paid for the upgrade to storage space, but it is not allowing me to upload my music from home.  It worked for the bit that was on my laptop but it is just not an intuitive system at this point.

This is a perfectly simple player with big time added perks:It links to your cloud and almost all cd purchases you've ever made on Amazon.It's on Roku for easy connection to a home surround system.You can add your own non-Amazon purchased mp3s and download the files to your drive of choice for further use.The player can be loaded onto multiple devices that all access your material.To sum up, this is a highly flexible and functional player.  Recommend!"
634,"Amazon",2016-10-13,5,"Amazon prime music is worth it.   I love free music. I listen to Pandora, and amazon prime. I also like music videos, so I spend some time on youtube. Amazon prime has mixed music, reading music, dancing music, and music for any other occasion you can think of. Good app."
642,"Amazon",2016-05-11,2,"Drains my Phone Battery!!   I love Amazon Music and the fact that you can download the music for offline listening but the fact that it drains my battery kills me. I won't even have the app running in the background or anything and I'll come back to my phone in 2 hours and 50% of the battery is drained."
644,"Amazon",2017-06-26,4,"Works great   Works great! Keep making it better and keep adding more music"
653,"Amazon",2014-08-10,5,"Essential app to enjoy Prime Music and download free music to your devices   If you are a Prime member and enjoy music, you'll want to check out all the FREE Prime Music offerings, but you'll need this app to be able to have all the selections play accurately and to enable you to download selections to your devices.I love the Amazon Music with Prime Music application as it makes it easy to see your music at a glance; either by artist, album or playlist. You can also use the Search in the app to find other Prime Music you may have missed and easily add it to your Library.This app upgrades your paid music too, so you never lose anything you may have already purchased on Amazon. If you have the Amazon Cloud Player, this Amazon Music with Prime Music is essentially an upgrade to that player with the focus on Prime offerings."
655,"Amazon",2015-11-06,5,"Prime Over Pandora   Love Amazon music.  Prime music is awesome.  I have the ability to sample most music before I buy and Amazon Prime Playlists are free to listen to, giving me the ability to choose what music I want on the fly.  I also love the unlimited skip feature, which means that I never have to listen to a song that I don't care for."

665,"Amazon",2016-12-14,5,"Beautiful choices are made available to us   Beautiful choices are made available to us.  I listened to the original sound recording of Hamilton with words screened on my phone. To enhance the quality I listened through my Bose Bluetooth.  Incredible experience."
674,"Amazon",2015-02-19,3,"the quality that i get is very bad...   Pain in the but, skips songs so the qualilty is ify and i tried my high speed wifi or my 4G LTE. Makes me reconsider buying from amazon music vs itunes. Only downloaded it because I'm  a prime member and I got free music, well, you get what you ""pay for"". only pro was the music i could get but you cant download it to your itunes or any other program its strictly stuck with them."
676,"Amazon",2016-02-23,5,"I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures   I am such a huge fan of amazon prime music. I have used other programs in the past, but the selection is hard to beat. I love using the different study mixes as I prepare lectures. My favorite part is the lack of commercials and a price tag seeing as it is included with my prime membership!"
678,"Amazon",2016-05-15,3,"Nice but could be much better   It's a nice service, but the selection is limited. And it changes. You could put a song in your playlist today, and tomorrow the rights are pulled and you can no longer access that song or that album.  I also find the phone app really annoying and difficult to navigate."
683,"Amazon",2016-01-11,1,"Update your phone? Lose both your downloaded and cloud library songs.   My Samsung S6 did an update recently, and now most of my music library on here is gone. The downloaded ones, and the cloud ones. Yes, even the music I bought, not just bummed off of prime. My google play music has stayed the same during this update. Loved this app until that, not I just don't bother."
688,"Amazon",2017-06-07,3,"If you log out all your downloads go away!   While I am a huge fan of Amazon music unlimited, i learned something by accident that I believe people need to know about! If you somehow log off the app or get logged off, all of your downloaded music goes away and you're forced to re-download it all, and like a previous reviewer said, there is no ""download all"" option so you need to download them individually. Amazon needs to warn people about this policy, or change it!"
694,"Amazon",2015-10-07,4,"All in all ok   All in all I have nothing to complain about, those 2 apps for video cameras are not working right (city cam and ispy) and I might be taking them off. The city cam freezes my phone and ispy is not coming in as it should, I have ispy on my windows 8 phone and on that platform it works right,but on the android it is scrambled."
696,"Amazon",2016-06-10,1,"Stupid to give a cryptic error and have no support   Could not get it to work on my Samsung Note 5. Had it, added another amazon app, and this stopped working.

708,"Amazon",2014-03-22,1,"Used to love it now I hate it.   I have been using Amazon exclusively for all my music purchases for years and loved it. Unfortunately, a recent update to all Amazon apps requires them to be linked to one account. Now I have to choose whether to have access to my music and apps or to have access to my Kindle books which are on a separate account. Very disappointing, especially when you consider that Amazon does not all me to merge my two accounts into one. Guess I need to find a new music service."
713,"Amazon",2014-01-08,4,"What happened to ""Add to Now Playing""   This was always a full 5 star for me (I use it on my Asus/Google Nexus 7).  With the last update, suddenly you can no longer long tap on a song or artist and ""Add to Now Playing"".  Very annoying drop, and no real reason to lose it.  Please bring this back, Amazon.  Knocked off a point for losing this feature.  Not super thrilled with the new interface either, but change is change as far as aesthetics.  Bring back Add to Now Playing (like Add to Queue from Google Play Music)."
716,"Amazon",2015-05-17,5,"Love This!   I love this app. Love buying all the old songs! Glad I don't really have to buy MP3 just to listen & buy all the old songs!!"
720,"Amazon",2016-10-19,1,"One Star   Will not down load, last version wasn't broke,so why did you ""fix"" it ????"
723,"Amazon",2015-12-04,1,"Not user friendly AT ALL   Very complicated app to use, not user friendly. I use it anyway to get the free music included with prime, but it could be SO much better.-It's difficult to create and add music to playlists. Also it doesn't allow you to have the same song duplicate times on a playlist, so you can listen to it over and over again.(iTunes does, for example.)-Search function is crap. Many times I have  typed the name of a song, album, or artist into the search bar, and it can't find what I'm looking for. But if I click and scroll around to find it, it's RIGHT THERE!-&#34;Repeat&#34; button doesn't work. It skips to the next song instead of playing it again.-Downloading music is weird... I always have to go back to the prime music store to double check to see if it downloaded. Sometimes it just doesn't show up under my device's music.There's probably more issues than what I've mentioned. PLEASE redesign your app, Amazon. I buy a lot of things off Amazon.com and I also use audible. With the amount of money I spend here, I should be getting a better app. And so should everyone else over here."
726,"Amazon",2016-11-25,1,"New Amazon Music version totally mixed my music, titles, songs & covers   This new version has totally mixed my music covers, songs, titles and artist!  I've done everything the has been recommended and nothing fixes it and you can't roll back to previous version!  Unhappy with this App!"
729,"Amazon",2015-12-19,2,"Constant buffering   Songs regularly stop to buffer for no apparent reason.  No issues with other streaming sites or with Prime videos/movies.  Songs sound scratchy and just plain crappy.  Playlist options are great, love the music.  Same issue on laptop and mobile.  Sigh.. waiting for it to improve to leave IheartRadio."
732,"Amazon",2016-12-04,5,"Amazing musical experience!   I love being able to look for a song that I've heard on the radio and find it on Amazon Music. Then I can create a folder of all the songs that I'm enjoying on any given day and play them on Alexa! Life is good!"
734,"Amazon",2015-07-23,3,"I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies ...   This is my last year because it costs too much.  I love the music streaming but I don't like the movies and books prime memberships.  It doesn't suck but it isn't  good enough either.  Streaming newer movies should never cost more than Red Box rentals who don't charge a membership fee.  I'd give it 3.5 stars but no way it gets four stars."
736,"Amazon",2016-03-14,5,"Five Stars   Works better than I thought it would....."
741,"Amazon",2013-01-09,5,"Best music app in any market   I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number."
742,"Amazon",2016-10-20,5,"Music for my wars!   How do I love the.... there isn't enough room to count the ways! Your given the opportunity to like or dislike selections and music is played to your desires. Could it get any better..... don't think so! Thank you Amazon!"

I have uninstalled and rebooted it several times with no improvement. I have AT&T as my carrier and am not sure if they have slowed my data speed. I am NOT happy with Amazon Prime Music!"
768,"Amazon",2014-10-21,1,"Make this app compatible with the One Plus One.  Until then it's useless to me.   No longer compatible with my device so I can't give it anymore than one star.  Was awesome when it worked though."
770,"Amazon",2016-01-29,4,"Decent app, good service.   The only thing this needs is the ability to 'go back' and change a rating for a song.  IE: If I ""thumb down"" a track, it'll remove it from play.  So, if you accidentally hit the 'thumbs down,' you're potentially removing a song you don't mind or even like from being played indefinitely, with no way of retrieving it.I sent a message to Amazon in this regard and received a ""we'll send your concern on to the development team,"" but never received a follow-up.Otherwise, it works great!  Good selections, convenient to use the 'cloud' to play on different devices.My wife wishes we could share playlists/accounts.  And it'd be great if you had a ""family"" Prime where each member could access the added features of Amazon Prime Music, Instant Video, etc."

This used to be a serviceable option for those of us not in iPhones, but now with their new streaming music service Amazon seems to be rapidly abandoning the non-streaming portion part of their music service. They're making it hard to upload your own music and their phone app is draining my battery at an alarming rate even when I don't use it.  Time to start migrating to another service before their service crashes all together and you can't even get your music from it anymore."

815,"Amazon",2014-06-20,4,"Amazon Music - I like the idea but a little difficult to use   This takes a little time to figure out how to use on my cellphone. It was a little confusing.After I finally got the app to work (on my cell) I was listening to music on my PC and then tried to listen to the same stuff on my cell. I got a notice saying you can only listen to one at a time.For some reason I had a little trouble setting it all up, but I think I now have it.I like the idea that I can choose from a huge list of music and then transfer it to my phone. HOWEVER, I wish these were MP3's so I could put them on a CD. That would rate this as a 5."

This is great, my only question is why is every-time I Iisten there is a loud squelch in the speakers about 30 - 60 seconds into the first song?

But I don't see any good reason for Amazon Music to be running at all after a complete reboot, much less becoming the highest user of data and battery!!!A recent update seems to have calmed it down a bit, so I'm giving it another chance."
861,"Amazon",2015-05-12,4,"Good! One considerable bug, could use a few features.   I've really enjoyed exploring new music and being able to download it to my device, I don't think it has the volume button skip capability even the screen is off that I enjoy as part of Google Play, it also will just turn off occasionally forcing me to reopen the app which is annoying and is dangerous/should not be done when driving.

They don't have every song I want to listen to, but they have most and they certainly have a library that is extensive enough to make great playlists.  My son and I use the service all the time to listen to music in the car.  There are no commercials, you can skip as much as you want and listen to your playlists in the order you choose.  This is perfect for me and I am thrilled that Amazon offers this service as part of my Prime membership."

It also searches Amazon for information about each MP3 as they are being uploaded.  And I'm sure they covered every file type know.  Amazon again keeps you up to date with the latest tech.  It's ease of operation is quite simple.  If you want things more complicated here, look elsewhere.  It's perfect for everyone from 8 to 80.  Excellent product."

912,"Amazon",2017-05-11,1,"Very unhappy with ""Unlimited"" Music   Very disappointed in this ""Unlimited Music"" plan. I have been an Amazon Prime member for years and really liked ""Prime Music."" When The new plan came out my choices of free music seemed to be greatly reduced, now I have to buy everything I want to add, not to mention the dropping off of songs I have already saved unless I want to purchase them. So I decided to try the ""Unlimited Music"" plan. So far it seems the songs I want are not FREE but have to be purchased. So how can this be Unlimited Free Music? I have read I can pay 10$ a month or 120$ per year and find a new music source. With Amazon Prime I pay 100$ and an added 80$ for ??? Add that together with the fact that many of the items I have been purchasing through Prime are more expensive than from other sellers on the internet I think I am about done with Amazon. Wish it wasn't so."

The User Interface is very easy to get accustomed to and the best part is most albums and singles are cheaper than other music apps.

I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it ""clean""!!!

It's just as easy for my phone to automatically connect and start streaming.  It sounds so much better.  Choices, choices... Streaming stations, my library, or prime music that is usually available with my subscription!  It's all there, in one place.

Their app is user friendly and there is plenty to choose from. Once again, thank you Amazon for having a phenomenal alternative to other, more popular music apps."
1364,"Amazon",2016-04-03,5,"Well done app thats very well done, but really kicks in and caters best to those prime members with prime music   Simply amazing. Ive been a prime member for years but finally switched from a KF HDX to a samsung tab as the fire tablets after the 3rd gen HDX became low cost budget tablets more so then they were.The app though offers a lot for prime music members and is very user friendly. Works perfectly on any device. Its even slightly easier to navigate then the inherent music app on the kindle devices themselves, due to an update on those devices that makes it more difficult to switch from online to offline downloaded songs. Great app!P.s - I still have my hdx, but mainly use it for music, as the sound is still better on my 3rd gen hdx than my newest galaxy tab s2, even through headphones"
1365,"Amazon",2015-12-19,2,"Let me use my other music   When I download mixtapes and other s*** I can't buy in your music library simply because these are songs that aren't available in any music store mostly your app doesn't show them in the recently downloaded playlist anymore wth amazon???"
1366,"Amazon",2015-03-16,4,"Great music tool, lacks radio choice   Great selection, great quality, lacks ""radio station"" like ability.  So I can select a bunch of stuff to ""add to my selection"" but I can't (or can't find it) select a simple set of music (ie Genre) to play or stream like a radio.  However, I do love it...it's become my go to music source"

Ok Prime members and music lovers, you need this app. I'm late to the digital game, so when I bought my Lady Gaga CD I was surprised that Prime gave me the digital versions too. Then I added the Amazon music app to my Samung and BAMB, Gaga all the time!Easy to use, loads fast and great quality."

Most of the songs of ones we've heard before, on earlier albums, but done this way, each song is new,  alive, and almost unbearably painful and beautiful.  Anais is a musical treasure; we're so lucky to have her!"

Only downside, you better maintain your prime status otherwise makes I tunes not the only game in town anymore.  This isn't perfect, but it never annoys me like other players do. It just works, and plays music."

1494,"Amazon",2014-01-28,4,"Getting a little clunky   I may be wrong, but it seems one needs their propitiatory downloader and I've had occasional problems with getting it out of the cloud and into my computer. I am not chained to a smart phone, but use a desktop and a laptop computer .. and my Kindle. Nice to be able to access it, but I've been lost rather often when searching for where on my device Amazon decided to download the song."

1519,"Amazon",2015-06-26,3,"nice selections and features for Prime but poor performance.   Nice Prime music selection and nice pre-made playlist but the app is terribly slow. I like the lyrics part and the radio with unlimited skips as well as the radio stations. I like the option to be able to download playlist to use offline. But the player doesn't work when I turn off all my radios. How do I know it's really offline music then? After listening to music for a random period of time the music will just stop playing. I'll pause it and play it again for it to work for only another few minutes till I have to completely close and re-open the app. Not really sure what this BlackBerry/Amazon deal was but it sure was more in Amazon's favor then BlackBerry users. Amazon took over BlackBerry music and video services but brought slow faulty ported apps to in place of it all."
1526,"Amazon",2016-12-19,5,"Great, music included   Amazon prime is the best service for it's price. 100 bucks for free 2 day shipping, Amazon videoand music. My most used apps. Thank you."

1544,"Amazon",2014-09-19,1,"App fails even after tricky install.   Per a chat with Amazon Technical Support, I had to load the Amazon Store app so that I could use that app to load this one.  Then, it still wouldn't work.  They had me uninstall & reinstall, but same errors.

1561,"Amazon",2017-03-13,5,"Fair enough   So far so good. I wish I could every song that i like. However the variety is good enough."
1569,"Amazon",2015-02-06,2,"Great for prime music, horrible for your device.   It does provide access to the massive online selections, but it really does drain your device.  Always running and killing your performance/battery. Force stopping it is a temporary measure at best since it always pops back up.  Linked to the amazon store app, and altogether, they are a mess."
1574,"Amazon",2014-06-25,1,"Amazon cloud player sub standard forAmazon   After starting the player i listened to a few songs then opted to skip another. The player then was playing two songs simultaneously. I could not get it to stop. Every time I pressed play, i was listening to hall & oates at the same time it was playing simply red. I also couldn't find an exit or quit option. Never had that issue with Pandora."

1591,"Amazon",2014-01-13,5,"Amazon MP3   This is a must have if you want to download music on your Android device.  To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device.  It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want."

I have never had whatsoever any problems, or delays etc. with the services rendered.  Thank You Job Well Done Amazon.  It takes a great STAFF I am sure."
1594,"Amazon",2014-07-14,1,"Ugh.   This issue with the app only playing music from a specific destination folder on the internal card is also creating another problem, playing music you didn't purchase from Amazon. If a sizable portion of your (large) music library isn't from Amazon, this app is worse than useless, it actually makes your music listening experience worse."
1598,"Amazon",2017-03-17,5,"Five Stars   Great! So far I've had nothing but good experience with this product and the firestick."

I downloaded the app to my android tablet as well as android phone, but the music downloaded to my Kindle Fire does not sync with the other two. It is such a disappointment as I like to listen to music on my cell phone while I take a walk. If there is any way to sync the music with my android products, please let me know."
1603,"Amazon",2016-05-02,3,"Not so easy to manage and use it.   Not so into it, as it is not very easy to set your stations and have my ALEXA play it. It is rather confusing if compared to other music services.I am not happy with Amazon Prime."
1607,"Amazon",2013-05-19,4,"Pretty awesome   We've moved all of our music now to Amazon MP3, after trying it out for a couple of months. It works very well, and it's really nice to have our music available to different devices via the internet...and not to have the music taking up a lot of room on our computer. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't always recognize songs from obscure bands and sometimes gives us trouble uploading songs if it doesn't recognize it."

1661,"Amazon",2015-10-07,5,"worth it!   Tons of songs, albums and artists. Easy to navigate.....hardly uses any data on my mobile. Commercial free and I can skip songs as many times as I want. This app was worth paying for prime by itself, not to mention the other perks!"
1664,"Amazon",2016-12-23,3,"Not too bad...   Overall this app is competitive with Spotify and Play Music, and definitely blows Napster (Formerly Rhapsody) out of the proverbial water. It does have its pitfalls however. The biggest of which is the fact that MP3s you've already downloaded will be miscategorized. Also I've found that although the option does exist to download play lists the songs will not show up in the ""Downloaded"" section. Secondly, the music you purchase is not transferable across other platforms. Simply put, of I purchase a song outright I feel it is my right to download said song in a universal format such as .MP3. User interface is easy to navigate, and I have yet to come across an artist that is not in the ""Unlimited"" category. Anyway, I gave it a try for 1 week and have decided to switch back to Spotify premium. In my opinion the extra $2 per month is worth it."
1665,"Amazon",2016-06-27,5,"Many music genres to choose for your listening pleasure   I like the amount of genres selection."
1669,"Amazon",2014-04-19,5,"Love this app   I bought a Zune MP3 player years ago, and I hate how they demand that you pay $150 a year for the service.  I didn't remember to get online and order new songs every month, and wasted my money.I am SO happy with this app.  Now I can listen to my favorite music anytime, and I don't have to pay a ridiculous amount (or anything at all) to use this service."

1715,"Amazon",2014-12-24,5,"Best Music Selection   Prime Music is the best thing I am getting other than free shipping with my Prime memberships.

1754,"Amazon",2016-01-19,4,"Perks of Prime is very enjoyable. While driving.   Enjoying it as an extra form of entertainment while driving in my car or home."
1756,"Amazon",2015-07-09,4,"Good app.   Thousands of songs to download on your cloud and play anywhere. Multiple genres and all the functions of iTunes. Make your own playlists.so easy and best of all is free with your Prime membership. Makes the $90 a year a little easier to accept."
1762,"Amazon",2016-03-23,1,"disappointed...   Amazon sent the link but it won't download to my Windows Phone (get a message that says the link is not working). Any tips would be appreciated... I really want this app on my phone."
1763,"Amazon",2016-06-02,5,"Five Stars   A great extra to being a prime member!"
1764,"Amazon",2015-08-05,1,"not good. At the current rate   This service is... not good.At the current rate, it will never compete with pandora, spotify, iheart, or any other music service. Not much of the music I want to hear, without buying it specifically through amazon. I'll pass."
1769,"Amazon",2015-02-24,1,"Constantly broke   I was really excited about getting more music through Amazon because i have prime. But all I'm getting is a bunch of disappointment. This useless app sends me a crash notice about every 2 hours and constantly froze when i did try and use it. Looks like ill keep using apple."
1771,"Amazon",2014-06-25,5,"Very Awesome App   This is one of the best amazon apps out there. You have the option of storing music in the cloud or on your phone. And now with prime, you can get many free albums or songs for free. Such an amazing addition to an amazing online shopping website. Music doesn't skip or buffer when stored in the cloud. Sound quality is amazing."
1776,"Amazon",2017-09-07,5,"Five Stars   Awesome!!"
1782,"Amazon",2014-11-09,1,"Frustrating   Not only is the app itself difficult to navigate and completely the opposite of intuitive, now it has started crashing as soon as it opens. I switched from Slacker and started paying for a Prime membership to avoid the lags and crashing issues with Slacker, so I'm extremely irritated with this."
1783,"Amazon",2015-08-10,5,"Amazon Prime is good thank you very much and i like it   Amazon Prime is good thank you very much and i like it. So keep the good work.Tank you, Yamil.Have a nice night."
1785,"Amazon",2014-03-25,5,"Great App   Is nice that i can download any MP3 purchase directly to my Android Tablet, instead of having to hookup the USB cable and transfer it that way.  Makes it easier to just move it to the Tablet when I purchase it, instead of forgetting to do so until I start looking for the track to listen to, and then realize i didn't move it over yet.  Nice App."
1787,"Amazon",2016-08-28,5,"Excellent service   This is a great add-on service for us. Driving down the road, wanting to hear some old album? OPpen Amazon music and stream via BT to your car!"
1789,"Amazon",2015-04-10,2,"If you really LOVE music, this is not for you   Prime would be great if the encrypted files would download to the card instead. My phone stays constantly full and I have to delete music to add any more. I already buy so much music that I wanted prime so I could check out what I haven't heard but what a hassle"
1791,"Amazon",2014-06-22,5,"love this new music option   great streaming option for desktops. I have not tried the mobile phone streaming app yet, but if it works as slickly as the desktop streaming this will be a nice option.Only thing I don't like is there is a pause between songs. Might be nice if it matched up so one song blended into the next for sound continuity."
1795,"Amazon",2016-02-04,5,"good  music with Amazon   This is another good thing about Amazon Prime being able todownload music with much included with prime membership, lwith the plus being you can download and listen offline  at no extra cost."
1799,"Amazon",2013-05-29,2,"Was good once...now this app is TERRIBLE!   This app used to work great about 3 updates back, but now it is terrible! Shuffle just plays the same set of songs over and over despite adding new music to the library. If you skip a song, the app thinks you are still on the old song and plays the previous track from cache as the track you just skipped to. The interface is so so. I'm looking for a different app to play my music from. This one just sucks."
1802,"Amazon",2017-04-09,5,"Five Stars   Loving all the music"
1804,"Amazon",2017-09-06,5,"Fantastic service!   Any genre I'm in the mood for, any time. Fantastic service!"

1817,"Amazon",2014-01-22,2,"A store first - player as an afterthought   This used to be my main MP3 player on Android.  It was never great, but it worked.  Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player.  The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player.  You can't bypass this anymore.  There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet.  Uninstalled."
1818,"Amazon",2016-06-03,5,"The Best   PERFECT ANY SONG I WANT IT'S THERE"

BUT today it logged me out and when I logged back in my offline playlists were deleted. Bug they have to fix."
1828,"Amazon",2017-03-20,5,"Must have for music fans   Will never be without music again! Love it!!"

1834,"Amazon",2017-11-11,3,"Three Stars   Crashes on my pc quite a bit. Some things saved to my music is unavailable unless bought over time."
1837,"Amazon",2015-07-24,2,"Its ok...   It's ok if you are looking for something specific and they have the title. Would be nice to look for genre choices so I can hear something new or not discovered. I have Google music which is much better for music in my humble opinion.."
1843,"Amazon",2015-04-13,5,"Great music   Love it."
1845,"Amazon",2016-07-08,1,"One Star   It sux. Does not work!"
1850,"Amazon",2016-03-29,1,"WILL NOT UPDATE   It is musically wonderful, but it's an almost useless app considering it will NOT update, & will NOT stop notifying me to update. Has crashed my HTC twice upon RE-downloading."
1855,"Amazon",2016-03-02,2,"Meh   Kind of clunky menu. Wishing it was easier to navigate. I guess I'm comparing to Pandora more than anything. Be more like Pandora Amazon Music! I love not having commercials though."
1858,"Amazon",2017-06-09,5,"Awesome!!!!   Best app to use for music when you have the subscription"

1875,"Amazon",2013-01-06,5,"works   If this app came on your phone only your carrier can decide if you can remove it or not. Sprint did not preload this app on my phone. I chose to download and use it. I found I could move the app to the SD card on my phone. It works just fine there. I play music stored on my SD card far more than the stuff on my cloud drive. I like this app. I don't like reviews that rate apps down for issues caused by choices made by carriers."
1878,"Amazon",2015-05-12,5,"Better than Pandora   Better than Pandora (I'm with Pandora since they started) because you can listen to any song you want, fast forward, go back while the song is playing, repeat a song that you like (as many times as you want) and you can even make your own playlists."
1880,"Amazon",2016-04-10,1,"What a crappy app!   All I can do is see that I have purchased the app and cannot download to my android device! No directions are given and it is not an automatic download! What a crappy app!"
1882,"Amazon",2016-09-04,5,"I love the free prime music   I love the free prime music,  really makes my $ 100 a year more worthwhile.  If they started charging me I would really lower my rating."

1887,"Amazon",2014-07-31,1,"Bad update deleted all my playlists on device   Lousy app.  Buggy, freezes, and now has deleted my playlists on my device.  I still have the songs, but have to rebuild playlists.  Can we even import playlists from Cloud to device?  Last I tried that was a no-go.  I'm a major Amazon fan, have Prime, and buy most everything through Amazon.  This app is lousy."
1891,"Amazon",2016-03-27,4,"Skips first 10 seconds of songs   Love it.  This has replaced both Pandora and Spotify on my phone and tablet.  Only negative... Lately it has decided to start every newly selected song 10 seconds into song."

I'm having a very difficult, most times impossible,  time downloading the songs, so I can listen when out of range of wifi.

1895,"Amazon",2017-01-24,3,"Spotify is the best music app by far.   Amazon music doesn't have a large variety of music. The app freezes a lot and the Jazz selection is very thin."
1896,"Amazon",2017-01-23,3,"Could be better.   Short on new music. Used to be able to download to my PC now it won't and I have to listen through my browser."

1914,"Amazon",2015-09-02,5,"I really like amazon's prime music   I really like amazon's prime music. If I could add one thing, it would be the option to have prime create stations based on an artist. I could enter an artist name and prime could custom create a station of similar music."

1926,"Amazon",2016-01-28,5,"Love streaming music with prime   Love streaming music with prime. It's like having Pandora with no commercials. The bonus feature is when streaming music stations, you can save any song you like directly to your cloud."

1929,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"Not terrible   It has a pretty decent collection of music and the variety is great. I particularity like the stations that allow you to explore music you are interested in with unlimited skips and ad free. It has definitely become an everyday app"

1959,"Amazon",2014-12-16,5,"Better than itunes!   I honestly don't know why anyone would go with itunes when this is available. I love this service. I use it instead of Pandora or itunes. It has a history of every single CD I have ever purchased in the history of buying from Amazon. It was automatically downloaded for free."
1965,"Amazon",2015-05-18,3,"I liked the idea of this app   I liked the idea of this app....but something feels kinda unstable about it. It always crashes and suddenly closes when I try to use it on my Samsung Android phone. It is quite annoying to be listening to music and it suddenly stops mid song."

1970,"Amazon",2016-03-28,1,"Will Not Uninstall   In addition to other bugs, I cannot remove this and now it keeps trying to update, but that fails. Amazon chose poorly when the hired the developers for this. Shameful."
1977,"Amazon",2015-04-12,1,"update   Amazon what did you do this new update is horrible. You took functions away and made it hard to navigate. If it's not broke don't fix it! I can't fast forward my music anymore and trying to find recent downloads is next to impossible. Plus the bugs."
1978,"Amazon",2015-10-12,5,"Good one!   Workd great. If I look my kindle battery or don't want to carry it along with the other 325 pounds of stuff in my purse.  Have a back-up, plus can play what I want to listen to while I'm driving.  Thank you!"

1986,"Amazon",2016-06-30,5,"Nice ++ to Amazon Prime.   this is a great way to listen to music you like without having to purchase it separately.  But easily you can purchase albums or singles from it."
1990,"Amazon",2017-05-31,3,"Meh... it's okay. Maybe I'm hoping for too much.   It's functionality is nice. I like that I can choose ""Offline Music"" and just listen to my own songs rather than streaming randomly from some online stream. However, in my experience thus far, the sound processing and regeneration through my bluetooth connection (to my car stereo) is lacking. The full range of the music doesn't seem to be getting through -- almost as if it thinks I'm playing to headphones and so it's cutting back on the bass a bit. I've found some (not many!) music players that will allow me to pause the music from my stereo. Maybe its my stereo's fault, but I can't do that with the Amazon Music App. It also doesn't show the time tracking of the track that's playing, where some players seem to be able to do that just fine. It would also be nice if they'd get on board with the ""Google Assistant"" programming and make it so I can tell ""OK Google"" to run certain commands within the app."
1992,"Amazon",2016-02-16,4,"Very good if you have prime   It's got a good amount of popular songs, and bands on here. It not near Spotify variety, but for casual listening if you alredy have Prime it's definitely an app worth getting."
1993,"Amazon",2017-02-02,5,"Five Stars   Good selection of music with great quality, all included with my Prime subscription, what's not to like?"
1996,"Amazon",2016-06-16,5,"Five Stars   Very good music site"
2000,"Amazon",2016-03-02,4,"Almost There   This is almost perfect, just add a way to search prime music by genre, and a way to share a suggested album or song with prime friends and family. Then you'll have a 5 star"

2043,"Amazon",2011-10-13,5,"Good app, but needs on-device playlist backup   This is an excellent music player, and does well whether it is feeding from the cloud or from your local device. It could use the ability to backup an on-device playlist to the cloud, and download a cloud playlist to the phone or tablet, resolving it to music already on the device. It's a real problem when you  create a playlist of songs, and if the device goes through a major reset of some kind that clears the media database, then the playlist is lost forever and needs to be recreated."

So I have my music on 2 devices plus my kiddo's tablet :0) I've got access set up for everyone to use. It's easy too use and making play list for all makes it easy for all too use. It's free so how could anyone say no? And, there is lots of great deals on music. :0) how do I put it on our laptop?? lol"
2057,"Amazon",2015-04-10,4,"Good player when it works. Works well with Prime.   The upside of this app is that you can find virtually any song you suddenly have an urge to hear, and with Prime you can do it at no extra cost.The UI has gotten much better over the last year. It looks the same but it's much more responsive."

2112,"Amazon",2014-11-03,5,"Favorite way to download music   Favorite place to download music the app is simple to find and download music. Have no problems with moving music to my SD card never had any problem and no need to download a app to move the music just got into you folders and move it. The only place I use to get music now."
2119,"Amazon",2013-01-29,3,"Nice but could be more   I have moved all my music to Amazon Cloud Player, as Google Music was limiting and iTunes Match was a joke for me.  Really l ike the service.  But Amazon has invested so much, seems like they would invest in a more robust app for their music.  But it is a simple easy to use app.  Play back is good, but not excellent, has so much potential."

I wanted to pull them down from the cloud onto my phone but kept putting it off.  The app makes it too easy to keep procrastinating.  You can download or stream and shop for more music and buy with 1-click. The app functions fine on my HTC Incredible 2, no bugs so far.  Recommend it without hesitation."
2131,"Amazon",2015-02-06,5,"Good app for carrying tunes   Very easy to use.  I didn't realize music I had bought this past year on DVD was in the cloud on my list of music.  Now I have tunes I like on my laptop and phone.  Frivolous -- maybe, but I can't carry my stereo with me and I never liked my MP3 player."

2133,"Amazon",2014-06-22,4,"Awesome !   When I was told about this opportunity, it didn't faze me until I was shown the range of music to choose from.

2171,"Amazon",2017-08-29,2,"Amazon Music, not part of Prime??😱   Hate that this app is not part of the Prime subscription & it has its own separate monthly fee."
2173,"Amazon",2014-06-12,5,"What is not to like with this Genius Idea on behalf of Amazon ?   Apple look out. I love this app and find no use for my iPod anymore why would I ? I still believe in buying CD's, I like to read the liner notes and have a tangible item, not just be forced to download it from iTunes. My whole iTunes library is all of my CD's apple iCloud won't let me back up my CD's only music I buy from them and I refuse to conform or be forced by Apple to do so it is so wrong and a big business mistake for them. I believe and support buying cd's not digital downloads.Finally a very smart solution. A genius move on Amazon's part I downloaded this app, upgraded for $24.99 a year for 250,000 songs and another application that moved my music from iTunes in minutes. I have 3 - samsung note 3 and a galaxy 5, a kindle and a samsung tab it uploaded all my cd's from iTunes in minutes (I have comcast). I put my phone in a holster, in the car and play through the built in blue tooth or can just listen anywhere I go.Another thing Amazon does is when you buy a cd from them they automatically upload it. I am glad to see they are helping to keep music cd's alive and not just offer some digital download, all though they offer both digital and hard copies of cd's I think they are just so ahead of the game and if people were educated caught on, this would topple iPod sales. You don't even need to have one anymore this app makes it all seem like it was a big waste of money and the only game in town, now it collects dust in the drawer.  My anger at iCloud not allowing my cd's drove me away. Don't get me wrong I work on a MAC but for music Amazon is the MAC DADDY.Kudos to Amazon such a fine genius job.So sick of Apple and every time the computer crashed I lost all my cd's in iTunes because iCloud would not allow me to save my own cd's and had to start all over again.Amazon has is and always will be extremely advanced. Dropbox, iCloud have nothing on this app.It is clunky once and a while and slow but for the most part streams seamlessly. Also great on my Kindle HDX and all my other devices way to go Amazon !"
2174,"Amazon",2015-09-13,5,"Love this app!!!   Easiest music application I've ever downloaded. You can download songs, albums or play stations with your favorite artists! I wish there was newer music in here but the choices available are really good!"

2187,"Amazon",2014-12-17,5,"Nice!   Another great benefit of being an Amazon Prime member, usd99 annually. With this app, I can get my Prime music on my android tablet. (Edit=>) For security purposes, later versions of android were modified to prevent apps from writing easily to the add-on SD card. But each app can create ONE folder on the add-on card to write to. Amazon Music apparently hasn't chosen to do so.But that's not a problem since you can connect your android tablet/phone to your PC using a USB cord (you can use the one for charging). With your Windows PC and android device on (signed on to both), both the internal and external storage for your device will appear either as folders, or as new drives. This allows you to read, write, move all your files from one storage area to another or to/from your PC.  I think you should change your device time to lock to give you enough time to accomplish your business when you are moving files around using this method. Change it back when you are done.Meanwhile, there is an app named ""Amazon MP3 Mover"" that will move any amazon mp3 music you buy to the add-on SD card, to the app's assigned folder.[On copying my music from my PC to a folder [Music] I created on my add-on card, error messages would periodically appear. Some were that there was no license for music that required a license. Some were that the format was not recognized. Just hit ""skip"".]"

2593,"Amazon",2015-02-20,4,"Good, but could perform better   I appreciate the Prime music, but streaming the songs can be very spotty, and skip. If I resort to downloading the songs, then I have no issues. Other than that, it's a simple app that could use some performance improvements."

I can navigate all the albums, artists, songs, etc., but when I tap play, I get an error.  Every. Single. Time.The app has NEVER worked properly, unless I only want to navigate through all the songs and never actually listen to anything.  In that regard, it's great.I contacted Amazon Customer Service who basically had me clear the app cache and data about 6 times and then removed all of my other devices from my account, to no avail.  It's been 2 weeks and nothing has changed.I'm sorry to say:  for an otherwise outstanding company, they failed me on this one.UPDATE - I got a new phone and I don't have any of the above issues."

I never thought I'd ever need to give such a negative review to anything Amazon sells much less one of their products but this latest ""upgrade"" of Amazon Music has been a major disappointment to this user/ customer. My major complaint is the inability to upload songs from my laptop to Amazon Music. I've tried numerous times and all I get is the screen with the new logo on it and nothing else. The screen just stares back at me mockingly smirking."

3399,"Amazon",2014-07-09,3,"Where is the Fire TV version of the app???   I like this app for the most part.I have used the PC version for Windows, the iPad app, and the Android app for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Over all it performs well enough, but i do have a few gripes about it.First complaint is where is the version for the Fire TV? I'm using the app on an Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft device, but Amazon hasn't got a version yet for their own device?? I keep hearing soon, but soon is never soon enough!My next complaint is with editing songs/albums you have uploaded to the cloud. As with the Amazon MP3 app that this app replaced there is no way to edit album art. I have over 15,000 songs uploaded to the Amazon Cloud Player and a number of them don't have the correct album cover art. Some have no album art at all even though all my songs/albums have a high quality image embedded in the MP3 file itself. If the mobile apps can't do this so be it, but you should at least be able to copy/paste your own album art on a PC or Mac similar to Google Play Music , iTunes, etc.I also cant seem to stream any music via 3G/4G without constant buffering, so i have to make sure I remember to download music via Wi-Fi before leaving the house. I don't believe this is a limitation of the app, but has more to do with my cell carrier (Sprint) in my area. I also can't stream from Spotify either so it's more of a network issue.I also don't like the fact that you have to add anything you want to play for the Prime Music selection to your library before you can play it. I use services like Spotify, Slacker, and Amazon Music to discover bands as well as play music I already know, so I don't want to add music to my library that I might not even like. We should be able to play the music and then add to our personal library if it turns out you like it.Otherwise I think its a good app with much potential. The GUI is nice enough and easy to use. I expect Amazon, with their deep pockets, to sign more music labels and make more music available for Prime members in the future, but the selection isn't bad considering Prime Music just launched about 3 weeks ago. Still has a ways to go to reach Spotify's catalog of songs/artists/albums."

This is awesome!I'm downloading whole albums of Blues, Jazz, and whatever else I want for free.

3952,"Amazon",2014-06-16,3,"It's alright.  A nice added bonus to Prime members.  But...   Don't expect it to be like Spotify, Slacker or Pandora.  Maybe I haven't the found the feature, but it doesn't seem like this will play songs based on something you're currently listening to.  There are already preexisting playlists, and you can create your own.  But the nice thing about these other apps is that it allows you to discover new artists or less commercially successful songs.  I don't know if not adding this feature was on purpose, putting them pretty much in direct competition with the sites/apps mentioned above.  I would have been a great feature, and I'd give it four or five stars then."

3983,"Amazon",2016-06-17,2,"They broke the shuffle feature   Under normal circumstances this app deserves a good solid 4 stars. With the newest version however, I have to downgrade my assessment and take away 2 of those stars because what should be a standard feature of any music player no longer works. The newest version breaks the shuffle feature almost completely- especially if you have amassed a library with thousands of songs.In the old version, when you toggled the shuffle feature, your songs would be played in a somewhat random fashion- as should be expected. In this new version, when you toggle the shuffle feature, a contiguous block of up to 500 songs is automatically selected, and it is only from within that block of songs that there is any randomization. I don't find this acceptable in the slightest.I like the new ""Play Queue"" feature, however when I enable the shuffle feature, I expect a play queue to be built that is completely random and could possibly include any of the songs in my library, not just a contiguous chunk of 500 songs."

5035,"Amazon",2016-08-17,1,"Zero morality settings, ZIP   This app has a LONG way to go.  But it's all you can use with Prime music.  Searching for music comes up with lame knock-off remixes, and bands instead of the original artists.  That is SO LAME. Also, there is NO EASY WAY to setup preferences to NEVER EVER find and/or playback explicit lyrics!  Completely hazardous to family values.  I would say that most people do NOT want to hear music that sings F_CK and B_ITCHES and MOTHERF_CKER all the time.  Do NOT listen to ""RnB"" music on Amazon unless you like hearing the F word 1000 times per work day."

7916,"Amazon",2015-06-04,3,"WHY IS THE RESPONSE TIME ON THE ECHO APP SO MUCH FASTER?   I have the same problems with response that people have noted-I have a massive collection in my music library(134K songs and I exect to max it out-I overbought CD's over the years).I like the interface, but when I go to search for an artist (even with a name like Todd Rundgren) the search takes several minutes. I assumed this was due to the amount of songs I have uploaded, but the same search on the Amazon Echo app takes a second or two. My response time on my iPad is even worse, but the Echo app for iPad is instant.Not sure what the issue is, but if Amazon were able to make searches go quicker, this would be a five star rating. When people ask how satisfied I am with streaming through Amazon, I feel obligated to mention the painfully slow search time."

Not possible.The ""upgraded"" player is terrible!  It locks up my Asus tablet, cannot find my downloaded music - even the music I've purchased from Amazon and will not play my playlists.Geez, Amazon!

9647,"Amazon",2014-11-03,1,"Like others have said   Like others have said, I too consider this the absolute worst application I have ever used.  Why, Amazon, have you made this so difficult?  I have spent 25 years in IT, and believe me when I say, this is the most frustrating and non-intuitive application I have ever used.  The only way I have found to use this is to download it to my computer first and then copy and paste the songs/albums to my Android device!!  Really??  In this day and age??  Did you not test this before dumping this on us??  I have other problems with this thing, too, but I just don't have the time to go into it, and besides, I am not here to be your beta tester and right now, this is worse than beta software."

9701,"Amazon",2015-06-08,5,"Five Stars   Good"
9710,"Amazon",2014-06-18,1,"Zero stars -useless for mobile purposes, purchases still go to internal memory, deleted all play lists on my device.   The layout is not  user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine, but I feel like I've lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version: it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising (listening whilst in motion).You now have to stop, go to additional screens (with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards!), & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions (get playlist on device, shuffle, repeat song, etc.).Unacceptable from both a safety (car) &/or usability standpoint (exercise).When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile (eg: hear a song in a store that you like)-  it STILL loads it to the internal memory.  (!!!)My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math, but it's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions.(This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is).Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH....SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad; yeah, I (now know that I) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists (not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create, port, etc.).Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime.(I don't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi).When I'm on a road trip- it's my bandwidth that's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs, and I don't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I'm at home, fine.  But it simply doesn't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home, with selections, playlists, etc. already set up.What do I gain here by using this app?Whatever I do gain- it's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I won't be using their app (won't be running across products to buy)."

10405,"Amazon",2013-02-13,1,"HATE this app   HATE is not a strong enough word to describe how I feel about Amazon MP3 cloudplayer app. The only way to get it to download is to go into settings, deselect auto download, select it again, and then wait 5 minutes to see if anything is happening on your phone. The app itself doesn't indicate that any download is happening or eminent. I hate everything associated with Cloud. Compare the Audible App, which works in a completely obvious way. You press a button to download, it starts the download and gives you a progress bar. What the hell could be more simple? But that's too much to expect from the Amazon MP3 app. This thing blows. I absolutely HATE it, & it makes me HATE Amazon."

10472,"Amazon",2016-06-09,5,"Impressed!   Prime music impressed a friend and myself while listening to one of the playlists. We were both pleasantly surprised to hear many ""album cuts"" of songs that did not make Top 40 radio. The song repeat rate is much lower than a competing service I had subscribed to. It's easy to create custom playlists and add music to your library. I was skeptical of the Prime Music offering when Amazon introduced it but have come to realize it is not just a side venture; rather it is a extensive offering of music and artists."

10865,"Amazon",2011-04-19,5,"Great App, a couple changes suggested   I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player.  I've put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3.  Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.Great updates."

If I don't want to sync to my music on my toys I can still hear them all thru cloud. I like buying singles alot better than the whole album cause sometimes I only want one song.. Downloading is fast. Another great amazon product. I love amazon! I never shop anywhere else cause it has everything and at wonderful prices. Just recently joined Amazon Prime and since I do alot of shopping with Amazon the money I have saved as already paid for my yearly membership. Come on people 2 day shipping at no cost! What could be better. Should also say that if you lose your music you can always go to your amazon music and download it for free!"
10917,"Amazon",2016-07-15,4,"Very Satisfied   I love how it works and the ease of use, however it doesn't have the variety I would like to see. I am pleased with the service overall and my husband recently became a prime member just for prime music. I love that I can use it on any computer/tablet that I can log into my Amazon account on without having to download anything. There is a smartphone/tablet app that I use because it takes me to straight to prime music without going in though my account. I have had other music programs in the past that I couldn't use at work because they required me to download a program to use on my work computer. That is not the case here and I really like that."
10919,"Amazon",2014-07-05,1,"Frustrating!   Love Amazon.  Absolutely love the new Prime Music.  But why oh why can I not access music in my digital music library from my HTC phone like I used to before this new app took over?  I shelled out $30 for the larger storage space and was enjoying it constantly until one day a bunch of my music was gone.  Even worse, songs I've since imported into my cloud library and songs I've purchased from Amazon on my pc are not accessible on my HTC via the new app.  Until this is fixed, Amazon has lost my digital download business.  So sad."

10947,"Amazon",2015-02-25,1,"This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left ...   Where's the metal? It's all mainstream. I am constantly let down by Pandora and other so called music apps. I am a metal head who can truly recognize talent in any music I hear. This app is nothing but an extension of the over pampered, over rated, computer synthesized, failure of music today. This is why I enjoy metal. It's one of the few mediums left today that still has true heart. Sadly, even many of the hearts of this genera is selling out faster than American Idol can ruin the youth who watch and silently dream of this pop music crap."
10950,"Amazon",2013-02-14,5,"Auto-Rip Rocks!   I'm an old-timer - 47 years old. I grew up buying records and still like to hold something physical in my hands, so, I'm still buying CD's. They all get ripped and it's still incredible to me that these days we can walk around with thousands of songs in our pockets. When Amazon let me know that they now have all my CD purchases already ripped for me, well, that really is icing on the cake! Sound quality is fantastic and I'm enjoying this new feature immensely! Thanks, Amazon!"
10952,"Amazon",2016-05-16,4,"Love amazon music!   Haven't used this app as much on my tablet as I do on my work computer, but so far I love it. I love that when I click the thumbs down button, it automatically goes to the next song. Though it has played the song again when I'm on a different ""station"" on occasion. Is really like it if amazon could fix that. The only other issue I have so far,  is trying to close the app entirely from full screen mode. Other than that, I'm really liking this whole service and app!"
10955,"Amazon",2014-02-18,2,"not what i was expecting   To be honest i downloaded this app in hopes of getting free mp3`s after it was suggested from Shazam another music locater app. But sincei noticed that i would have to pay for sounds that i know i can get free even if there is a virus risk, i closed it and never bothered to open it or uninstall it. In search of a mobile app that i wouldnt have to pay for music, if there is anyone with info to provide me with please feel free.Unfair- it may be unfair that i rated it with only two stars but as i was disappointed the ratings showed."
10956,"Amazon",2011-08-24,1,"A piece of garbage   App installation and buying experience is ok.What is infuriating is that the app closes randomly. You put the android in your pocket, it closes. Put your phone on your desk, closes. Music stops, and you have to restart the app completely. App takes 15 seconds to load, even on my Samsung Galaxy S 9000. Song has to be restarted from beginning (interruption point was not saved)All this on our 2 phones (different models) so hardware problems are to be excluded.Really disappointed."
10959,"Amazon",2014-06-15,1,"poor   Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play.  I get ""exception 119"" or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of ""free"" (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play....."
10961,"Amazon",2016-06-18,5,"Fantastic App   I can't get enough of Amazon prime music.  The numerous different stations are fantastic and the variety is great. It is my go-to app.  The ability to download so many artistes is a plus . I love having the music playing in the background when I go to sleep. I just need amazon to make an app compatible for Windows phone."
10962,"Amazon",2014-10-31,4,"Great extra with the prime membership   Great extra with the prime membership.  I would give it five stars but it lacks the content that a beats music or spotify have.  I would gladly pay a little extra on my prime membership to have access to the amount of content I now get with beats music.  It would make my life easier not to have an additional music service that I have to pay for monthly.  I already pay for netflix, hulu plus, beats music and wwe network monthly, to get rid of beats and replace it with a vamped up prime music service would be ideal."
10966,"Amazon",2014-06-16,2,"Can't use it   I suppose it may be OK, but since I am an ""Invited Guest"" of a Prime member (my wife), I can't use it on my smartphone or Kindle Fire (my wife has neither so there's zero chance of having more than one device using it at a time).  I checked with Amazon and that's just the way it is.  Tough luck, I guess.  I'll continue using my subscriptions to Spotify and Panora."
10970,"Amazon",2017-06-13,5,"Fantastic little program!   Love this player when I am not on a computer.  I can listen to music anytime I want with headphone or ear plugs!"
10978,"Amazon",2017-03-30,5,"Five Stars   I love my Amazon Music.  It is great that Amazon offers so many different things with Prime."
10985,"Amazon",2015-07-18,5,"I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money   Use it for dinner parties, for everything! I listened to an album that I wanted to buy and realized it sucked, so it saved me extra money!"
10989,"Amazon",2013-02-07,5,"Fantastic App!!!   I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it.  All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service.  You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone.  It's great!"
10990,"Amazon",2017-09-17,5,"Five Stars   I love the instant rip and available music with my prime subscription."
10992,"Amazon",2011-06-30,1,"This program is not just bad its damaging.   I installed this App last night thinking oh neat free MP3 of the day, since its instillation my tablet has been unuseable. I will be needing to send it to the factory to get it running again as the amazon apps crash taking the entire device with it. I will not only not be reinstalling it when my Tablet is repaired I will not be installing any amazon software again."
10999,"Amazon",2014-10-22,4,"Four Stars   Amazing selection. Thanks Amazon Prime for ALL the goodies you offer members."
11000,"Amazon",2017-03-23,1,"If you don't want to pay, you're only allowed to look   So what exactly does having a prime membership get you in this app? Amazon keeps telling me I can listen to ""free music"" with a prime membership but it seems one needs another membership on top of that to actually play anything. Really disappointed at what this app turned out to be"
11005,"Amazon",2013-02-10,5,"The BEST   I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can't sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere.IT IS AWESOME....DownLOAD it now...why are you still reading this..go download."
11010,"Amazon",2013-02-12,1,"Music only on internal storage?   This app only allows you to download your music to internal storage which is limited and valuable. No ability to save to external SD card by 2013 is a massive failure by a massive company."
11011,"Amazon",2017-10-08,5,"Good music   Good app easy to use.good music."
11015,"Amazon",2017-06-21,5,"Five Stars   Amazing, far better than pandora."
11017,"Amazon",2017-04-29,5,"Five Stars   you got music any time any where"
11018,"Amazon",2014-10-09,4,"Worthwhile for Prime Members at Least   As an Android user and an Amazon Prime member, I got this app to take advantage of the Prime Music Amazon now offers for free for their Prime subscribers.  It is functional and the music selection has improved vastly since it started up this summer.  If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber and have an Android device you might as well take advantage of this."
11020,"Amazon",2016-10-24,1,"Get google music instead   clunky and not as good as Google Music"
11021,"Amazon",2017-06-19,5,"Great app!!   Unlike other music apps we have tried Amazon music does not have ads or commercials and I love that."
11027,"Amazon",2015-03-19,5,"... had this app since it came out and I love it. However   I've had this app since it came out and I love it. However, last night I downloaded Android 5.1 to my phone, now Amazon music player crashes whenever I hit play on any Prime Music. Please fix!! My morning commute is not the same!!UPDATE 3/23/15: got the 5.1 fix installed, happy days are here again! Changing to 5 stars, thanks Amazon!"
11028,"Amazon",2014-10-24,1,"OnePlus & Ouya compatibility   Hugely unstable on OnePlus One (and apparently other OPO devices) for several subsequent releases. Unusably flaky on an Ouya. Amazon kindly flags the app as uninstallable on the OnePlus in the Google Play store, but still enables access to the app on both devices through their own. Left hand, meet right hand. Or better yet: Just fix it."
11032,"Amazon",2013-02-13,4,"Amazon MP3 to the rescue   There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train."
11036,"Amazon",2013-02-25,5,"Great APP   It took two neices and three freinds to convience me to get this app to help me work my new tablet and they were right. This is a great app to find other great apps. I am not sure I would ever be able to work the computer but now I have all types of helpful and fun apps on my tablet, thanks to Amazon and my family."
11037,"Amazon",2014-10-23,1,"No longer works on the OnePlus One!!!   This app used to work fine on my OnePlus One, but now it crashes all the time.  Please fix ASAP so that I can enjoy it once again.I believe there might be a compatibility issue with the latest CM 38R update?"
11038,"Amazon",2013-03-09,1,"kept refreshing and bumping me off the net   No problems before I downloaded this app. After downloading Net would disconnect every 2 -3 minutes. UNINSTALLED after 20 minutes. No problems now And then I tried to install the cloud player.... can't find the widget... and it is also unstable on the site. I try to play something and it will just stop playing."
11042,"Amazon",2011-05-12,1,"bugged, broken or just bad design?   Can't even install it because my default language isn't english. oh wait my phones default language is english. fail.i've never had this issue before with any other app. why not just take this setting out and let us select what language we would like to install the app in."
11043,"Amazon",2015-03-22,5,"Five Stars   Outstanding hands down"
11046,"Amazon",2013-02-20,5,"Works great!   This is my go-to app for all music now.  Once you go Amazon, you can't go back... or something like that.  Great product....easy to use... have some issuesa saving mp3s to my SD card on my phone.....so I just save them like normal, then use a file manager app to move them where I actually want them :p"
11049,"Amazon",2017-03-17,1,"This is a reminder...   On how spoiled I was when I had my Google play music subscription. Amazon music just cannot compete with the real deal. Google Play also gets Youtube Red that alone is worth the price."
11056,"Amazon",2013-02-18,5,"Fun.......   What a fun little AP !!I have it on all of my electronics.  SO far no glitches. It was difficult for my tablet to get itself onboard but once it was........... super!  It was a tablet issue not the AP issue.  TRY IT!!!!"
11058,"Amazon",2014-10-28,3,"Not for me, even though free.   Not bad, but too commercial - oriented toward selling tracks & albums.  Just no way I'm gonna pay a buck or so for digital music downloads. Also not user-friendly for me. I give three stars rather than two because it's free (for Prime members).Going back to Rhapsody."
11061,"Amazon",2014-10-19,2,"Not bad, but could be a lot better.   A bit dissapointed with Amazon music, especially with the fact that not all music is available to prime members, even if it was all included, it still wouldnt be that good, They are missing a lot of amazing artists, Bands and Producers. Its a good start though I guess."
11063,"Amazon",2017-03-31,1,"One Star   This sucks!!! Getting no where trying to get this on my I phone !!!!"
11069,"Amazon",2013-04-13,4,"Simple but Helpful   It's a nice app, but there's not a ton to do with it, which is fine because you're just listening to music. One handy feature is the ability to listen to music stored on the device itself without having to use a separate app. All in all, nothing bad to say."
11072,"Amazon",2012-12-07,1,"Amazon MP3   again we got this for my son to be able to get music on his android phone.  we have yet to be able to get it to work.  even though I have added his device to my account,  downloaded the app on the device.  it still says he is not authorized to use it."
11083,"Amazon",2015-11-13,1,"needs work   This app needs a lot of work . It keeps adding a new device everytime I reset my Android  device.It sucks"
11093,"Amazon",2014-10-23,5,"Great addition to amazon prime   Really great collection of music and it's organization only thing that I'd change is adding a feature close to Pandoras music mix to give you a saved playlist of music close and varying from the original added song or artist."
11098,"Amazon",2015-06-29,4,"the best damn music app on the Internet   I got to say I appreciate Amazon for taking care of my music when I changed phones as delete all the stuff off of one phone two go together they kept my stuff at least one song see the tower you have a blessed day"

11108,"Amazon",2011-06-07,1,"crashes when playing from cloud drive   cant play music stored on cloud drive without crashing.  so what's the point of storing your music in the cloud if you cant play it? 1 star until it's fixed"
11110,"Amazon",2011-05-17,4,"Keeps my SD space free.   Not the greatest looking mp3 player around, but good enough.  Functions well, though network hiccups are common.  Fits a need till Google Music goes public."
11113,"Amazon",2017-06-24,5,"Five Stars   Love it. Can't find a radio station worth listening to anymore."
11120,"Amazon",2014-06-17,5,"So far..............loving it!   I like it. I was able to download some oldies in English and also some oldies in Spanish. I like the feature. I do not like songs that are not from the original author.I use it and love it."

11124,"Amazon",2014-10-28,5,"Easy lintening   Its great. I can pull up several bands that I had not heard in years to listen too. I have lots of CD's but the time it take to switch a dis is more than twice the time to switch on prime"
11131,"Amazon",2015-03-18,5,"Pandora can suck it   A vast library of music that you can listen to all day long, commercial-free that you pick. Not some goofy algorithm that picks songs for you with advertisements every other song."
11138,"Amazon",2013-02-19,5,"If you like to download music...........   then this is also a MUST HAVE app.  Incredible variety, of music, good prices, and Amazon quality.  Have a new smart phone or tablet?  I would say this is a MUST HAVE standard app."

I had to redownload and resort the ""lost"" songs. Now it's done it again. It started by no longer reading the artist and album info, just the song title. Then it stopped reading the files altogether. Other music apps read and played the files fine. I see the song files on the card but the app won't play them. This time, my cloud too has only an odd assortment of purchased and already owned songs so i can't even redownload and there's no option to get the app to re-scan what's on the SD card, where the app itself put the files.

We have Amazon prime. We had the free upgraded cloud storage because of Amazon music purchases. But the cloud player really isn't worth the new $25/year, and the free 250-song limit is not going to cut it for us. So, we deleted our music from the cloud and are moving to google music.The Amazon mp3 app itself was ok, but never great. Leaving it is not a hard decision. Initially, I had imported all our music from iTunes. It copied the playlists, but nit the folder hierarchy, so dozens of organized playlists became a massive mess. Streaming worked ok, but obviously was heavily dependent ion the network connection. So I ended up copying my most-listened-to music to my sd card, and the built-in music player works very well."

11712,"Amazon",2016-09-16,5,"Getting better with age   I've been using Amazon Music for quite a while now and I have to say that I have seen constant improvements with every update. This is a perk that is not to be treated as an extra for your prime membership but a highlight of it.  One special note is that you are allowed up to 10 devices but if you call Amazon and explain that you no longer have some of those devices they are more than accommodating.  The selection of music has become very impressive and adding music to your library is easy and intuitive. I like the premade playlists  that they offer and even if I do not add that particular playlist to my library I have the option to add any individual song in that playlist to my library.  Amazon music works very well on all my devices and computers.  It is truly a great value added service."

The attempted setup of a library for music required that I pay for another subscription. Definitely not worth another $99. Cannot say how the service works. Unhappy"
11715,"Amazon",2016-05-11,1,"An Audiophile's Nightmare   As someone who has used quite a lot of different apps with musical capabilities, for work as a musician and personal use, I can say with confidence that this is the worst app for listening to music it has ever been my misfortune to be forced to use. Force closes for no reason, terrible organization, storage and RAM hog, causes phone to freeze to the point that I have to sometimes take the battery out to restart it, and the load time for songs in my offline library is ridiculously long. Seeing as this is the only way to listen to songs with my mobile device through Amazon Prime, I guess I'm stuck with this crappy app. Otherwise I am going to use the slightly less glitchy Google play music.  Seeing as I am paying for this mangled service, and assume some of my payment is going to app development, I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this particular of service from Amazon. Good music selection, but difficult to listen to and enjoy if the app doesn't work."
11716,"Amazon",2016-05-20,1,"Could use some editing   I can't move it to my SD card. Most mobile devices have pretty limited primary storage, and mobile service  providers tend to wantonly lay waste to what limited storage there is with useless apps that cannot be removed. It's pretty inconsiderate of an app developer to force an app to stay on the main device storage unless the user roots the phone, which can have serious consequences when coupled with certain service providers. I really do like the app, but it's a serious space hog and there just isn't enough room on a Samsung Galaxy S5 for apps that can't be moved to the SD card. If you update it, and check the box in Android Studio that allows the user to move it to the SD card, I'll be more than happy to use it."
11719,"Amazon",2017-06-08,4,"Amazon Music   Use this app almost daily.  Love that we can create our own stations to listen to.  Totally like there are no commercials to listen to.  But there are 2 complaints I have though.  If you put a song in twice by mistake it won't let you delete one of them unless it deletes both from the app.  There needs to be a way to just delete a copy.  Also when I travel I may be listening to directions and turn it off .  As soon as I restart my car starts it comes on /  even if I don't turn it on.  And if I turn it off and make a phone call it will automatically cone back on.  There is just a glitch were it comes on without turning it on that could be fixed.  But I love the music and so do my grandchildren.  We all have our favorite stations.  Highly recommend this Amazon App!"
11727,"Amazon",2017-11-11,2,"If you want the best app ever, and have the $$ for it, find something else.  ""Prime music "" is actually so so.   The Amazon music app is okay.  I use it almost everyday.  I'm content with the selection provided-occassionaly frustrated by an album I can't listen to.There have been a few errors with the program I've experienced.  But, the most egregious is the load time for me to access my music.  Somedays I'll hop in my car, excited to listen to some tunes.  I click on the app.  And I wait a moment.  Then some more moments...and it's still loading.So, a little frustrated, I'll start driving.  It couldn't take that long could it?Sometimes it'll come up after maybe 5 minutes or so.  Other times- 15 minutes down the road-  The screen still hasn't popped up.Usually.  After reaching my destination, I'll close all screens on my phone log then reopen the program and everything is cool.I do not know about programing, though I know I have a higher end phone, so I can't say 100% who's at fault here- but from the looks of it- others have the same problem with this app.Anyhow.  I'll likely keep using it.  I've been roped in with prime- this is basically free- only a few bucks a month- and I can listen to albums after whatever procedures I've come across.It's not convenient.  I don't like it.  But it'll do."
11730,"Amazon",2014-04-02,1,"Streaming works great. Downloading doesn't work at all.   I've been buying music and streaming it via Cloud Player for a couple of years now. Now I finally decided to try to download all of it (so I can put it in the car), and wow, what a mistake.I have just 974 tracks totaling about 6GB. Using the Mac version of Amazon's MP3 downloader, I'm now starting the fourth attempt with no hope of success in sight. The first two attempts ended with the downloader simply crashing partway through. Absolutely pathetic that such a simple piece of software, which shouldn't even be necessary in the first place, wouldn't be able to do its job. It's not smart enough to simply pick up where it left off, either, so you need to delete everything before trying again otherwise you'll end up with multiple copies of any files unfortunate enough to be part of the first, failed download.On the third attempt it managed to download all 974 files without crashing. Celebrations were premature, however, as it turns out a random 50% of the files were stored with cut off names. For example, a file name that should have been ""01. Track Name.mp3"" would end up just being called ""01. Track N"", with half the name and the .mp3 extension just missing. Again, the only thing I can do is delete the entire 6GB download and start again, crossing my fingers really hard this time. Thank goodness I'm not paying for bandwidth.It's difficult to imagine that someone could have fouled up a piece of software so simple by accident. The only plausible explanation is that Amazon is deliberately shipping this broken program in the hopes of discouraging people from downloading the music they purchase, hoping they'll give up and resort to streaming it forever instead. Considering that the music is sold to us with the promise that it can be easily downloaded, this is nothing less than a blatant bait and switch scheme."
11732,"Amazon",2014-06-19,2,"I feel prime just made things worse for this app   I like Amazons cloud and being able to upload (for free) your own music and download it on any device. While it wasnt my go to music app, because it was limited, it still did what it did very well.With the addition of free music for prime members how ever it feels that the weakness of the app's design has appeared. Prime members get a mix of; bad, ok, excellent choices of free music to choose from. Im a progressive house/trance fan so my selection is super limited. Im not one for modern day pop music.I know millions of people are okay hearing a song for the 30th time on the radio and for some reason add it to their playlist for more future listening. But I dont like that type of music. So I must depend on browsing for music. Prime music makes it really hard because the music I KNOW I want to hear isnt free so I wish Prime can introduce me to music I may want to hear that is available to prime members. Currently the only way to introduce listeners to new music is by listening to other peoples play list. Which so far I have found nothing I fully enjoy. And it seems you cant manipulate the playlist that easily. The user interface makes it difficult to add/delete music. Is the music I downloaded on my phone via a playlist totally tied to just that playlist or is it in my music library?*In addition I found that even searching for music even with knowing an artist makes finding prime music a pain. While typing in an artist on my PC (which by the way you can only sample songs when using amazon.com but you can search, meanwhile amazons music program lets you play a full song added to your library but you can search for songs outside of your library) I found that not all the songs for prime were listed when typing in the artists name. I had to type in the song individually to get that result.All in all it is a smooth start for Prime. Very little bugs.Pros:Not laggy and no bugs yetFree MusicGreat launch for PrimePop music for the masses.Cons:Hodge podge of song selections makes finding music you want to listen to more annoying.Music discovery is dependent on other peoples playlist. No I dont want to listen to Nicky Romero, Pitbull, and Armin all at once. Please add an intelligent radio program so to help you find music that fits your tasteUI is bit difficult and getting to the songs you want to listen to a bit tedious. Too much clickingadd/delete songs from playlists is confusing"

But as with all Amazon products, interact and select the suggestions as well as various a ratios station's and samples. Amazon-Amazing analytical tools as well as their buyers and Brand merchants  will  soon learn your likes and open new worlds."
11735,"Amazon",2017-07-30,4,"Pretty good!   Nice app. Easy to use, no ads. Good value if you are a prime member. Streaming, off line, individual songs, stations, thumbs up/thumbs down. It has per-existing play lists or you can create your own.Minuses? Not many. I wish it would remember the station I was listening to and return to it after I turn it off and then turn it back on again.Ali Julia review"

Why did they break my Amazon Music app??? i had playlists set up and I didn't have to have an inet connection to listen...now they are gone and I'm not able to find any of my music playlists or music I had downloaded!! Dug out my old sandisk and using that again.  Bad move Amazon!  I won't use iTunes so now I'm in search of a different provider.  great job - you just lost a customer."
11740,"Amazon",2015-09-27,1,"Barely functional   This application is terrible in almost every way. All I want is a quick way to take all of my music online and off and create playlists. Uploading my existing music is a dicey proposition with the Amazon Music Importer app, but even after I've got that done there's no way to get this app to respect my folder structure, so when browsing by (say) Artist I've got tons of single song artists because the metadata gives equal priority to guests and primary artists.Searching isn't terrible, except that when I change tabs and want to get back to going down my list at, say, ""m"" there's no way to do so other than scrolling down. Type 'm' and I'm moved to a different search tab. This isn't rocket science, the conventional way of navigating a list by typing the first letter has worked perfectly for ages and what you're this app is doing isn't better.Really though everything would be forgiven if it were a slick and fast app once I got in there. Problem is it's laggy and freezes up with barely a touch. There's a good app in here somewhere but I cringe every time I'm forced to use it when (say) interacting with my Echo."
11742,"Amazon",2016-08-12,5,"Great music app!   Many Prime songs and albums to choose from. You can build your own playlist and listen to it off-line (airplane mode to save battery life) if you download. You are not required to purchase music to build a playlist although I purchase my favorites to listen to on my mp3 player or memory stick while camping.However since my LG-G3 updated last night (08-11-16), the app is missing and will not install from Google Play Store or the Amazon site. Thankfully, I still have it on my tablet."
11746,"Amazon",2015-09-08,1,"garbage   This app is difficult to use and fails often. I have never used an app that made it this difficult to play music. It stops after every song so I have to go into the app and hit play whenever a song ends, there are weird noises sometimes when using this as app, and it isn't user friendly in any way. This app is garbage, it was coded by running thousands of rats over a computer keyboard. I would rather use a cheese grater to remove my toes then use this app any more."
11748,"Amazon",2016-11-06,1,"Poor experience with the amazon music software (5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400) for Windows   Today, i've updated the Windows Version of the Amazon Music Software to Rel. 5.0.4.1562.5.0.4.400. Because the in software upgrade option didn't work (the update didn't finish / it took forever), I had to remove it manually via Control Center, downloaded the new version and installed it manually. After first start the login screen locked quite crappy, pictures missing, poor contrast, poor dialog layout. However, i've managed to login.In the new software within the thumbnail view, about 60% of the pictures are missing (hate that). If i click some artist and change back to the my music overview the software constantly changes from thumbnail view to list view (really hate that). If i click to prelisten a track in the shop, i'm always getting a message ""a problem has occured"" while everything seems to be working as expected, always have to close this error message before i can select the next track (very very annoying). In the programm settings, i've deselected Auto. Music Import several times now, but Auto Music Import from folder always reactivates itself automagically (why is this option there, if i'm not supposed to change it?). The whole new software feels very laggy in contrast to the old software, although i've got the fastest PC hardware money can buy these days.While i like the Prime service in general (especially free shipment and video) and while i like the prime music idea and having a backup copy of all my music tracks in amazon's cloud, this piece of crappy low budget software makes me reconsider my cloud music backup strategy. And it makes me hate amazon, at least for the next few days. The android app is not much better. I'm going to uninstall both and stick with Spotify and large Micro SD cards in my DAC and my phone.I hope the people at amazon start using their software themselves, try it out!!! Really hoping that amazon music software is going to be fixed soon. At least to a level that doesn't piss the user off, within the fist 10 minutes of use! Hate it, when service providers waste my time!"

I uninstalled, the app, and my battery usage returned to normal.  So I installed a new battery in my phone and re-installed this app.  Again, battery power took a nosedive. And again, I uninstalled it.  I really would like to use this app, but it is doing something in the background that drains the battery."

11768,"Amazon",2016-05-26,1,"App Designed By Someone Who Has Never Used A Music App Before   I really want to love this app.  I really do.  Having legally free music is appealing and having good recommendations made has certainly increased the library of music I'm playing.But this app is absolute garbage.  It was designed by someone that never has used a music app before.  Maybe it's my phone?  I have some spare cell phones, I'll try this on to see if I experience the same issues and update my review.For reference, I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (t-mobile variation) and I'll be testing it on my Nexus 5 (old model) and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus (T-mobile variation) and a Samsung Galaxy S3 if it powers up.So here are the huge glaring issues with this app and service:1)  You can only upload 250 songs to the cloud.  That's pitiful.  Amazon is the damn king for cloud computing.  I refuse to believe they can't easily and at low cost up that number.  Google play music (which I was using before) let's you upload 50,000 songs.  A 250 limit severely restricts us and I refuse to rebuy my music catalog from amazon mp3.2)  If you add more music to your playlists from your computer, and you hit download on your app instead of it just downloading the new tracks you added onto the same playlist (ie Favorites) it creates a new playlist (Favorites 01) it doesn't redownload everything, but it's a nuisance.  In a year what will I be at?  Favorites 69?3) Why can't think app sync with the music app on my Amazon Fire Tv?  With google play music I can connect to google play on my chromecast and play my music on my surround system, I want to do that on here as well so I don't have to constantly skip tracks I've already heard recently.4)  This is the by far the biggest frustrating issue for me.....and related to # 3.  This app has never once played a playlist all the way through.  And it is INFURIATING.  What's the point of having a 800 song playlist if it keeps restarting!?!  I listen to music on the way to work and I'll get to track 8 of 800 and when I drive home in the afternoon I should be able to resume on track 9 of 800.  But it doesn't.  It. Keeps. Restarting.  So I spend most of time skipping tracks, because ""i just heard that this morning, heard that yesterday.""  Google Play Music never once had this issue.I want to hear a playlist all the way through.  I want to get home, sync the app to amazon fire tv and listen to music as I wash dishes, then go to the gym and continue my playlist.  And I want to not have the playlist keep starting over again every time I open the app.I switched from Google Play Music because of the allure of all that free prime music, and it has introduced me to some really great stuff I'd never heard before.  But the app is currently a broken mess."
11775,"Amazon",2017-06-05,1,"After the love has gone.....gotta find another player.   I've been using Amazon Music for a few years, and enjoyed downloading purchases to my android phone so I can play my own music in my car.  Now, however, I can't get through a single song through the car without an error message (exception 180) that stops the player cold.  The error messages suggest I ""try again,"" but the same thing happens over and over again to the point that I am completely UNABLE to play any of the music I've PAID FOR from my device.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  Now, I have to find a music player that doesn't hand up, and I figure, since Amazon music won't play on any other player, that I've tossed literally hundreds of dollars down the crapper.  And, from what I'm seeing on these message boards, Amazon customer service hasn't even bothered to address this issue with the customers who present it.  What a big FAT disappointment, Amazon."
11776,"Amazon",2017-09-28,3,"Nice, but a few usability issues   It delivers good sound but I have noticed that searching for stations from the app is much less user friendly than the webpage version.  Also, every time you touch something, it starts playing and then gets added to your Recent list.  I cannot remove the lullabies station from that list, which uselessly takes up precious real estate.  The other thing that is making me debate uninstalling is that it keeps starting on its own.  After I have shut it down, by pressing the X, it keeps starting itself up again.  After 5 or 6 closes, it stays closed."

I had switched from Spotify to Amazon music because Amazon had a few songs that Spotify doesn't and the music sounds a bit better from the Amazon app in my opinion.  I am giving this app a one star rating for two reasons below and after submitting this review will be unsubscribing from Amazon music.1) This app constantly restarts in the background and drains the battery on my phone.  I have had to install a separate app just to put it into hibernation2) A bug seems to have been introduced recently where despite there being 70 songs in my playlist, the app insists on repeating the same song endlessly.  Selecting skip only returns to the songs beginning.  The only way to get a new song is to manually select it.  Not something I feel inclined to do- especially since I only used this app during workouts."
11790,"Amazon",2015-12-25,5,"The latest release of the best 50 Beatles hits is terrible because the sound engineers ...   I am revising my assessment in the light of developments. My original harsh assessment was an accurate reflection of my displeasure of the reproduction of the newly released Best 50 Beatles'  Songs. Playing them back via an Amazon  Fire TV module to a Sony TV the tracks were a mixture of passable although degraded with respect to CD quality,  but in others the voice track was entirely missing or so weak that it was hardly audible against the instrument background. My original reflex was to blame the sound engineers for sloppy control.  I would now like to retract this negative assessment as I have found the cause although I don't understand the detailed mechanism yet. So I am writing this just in case others come across something similar. Let me add this only occurred on these Beatles tracks so I was fixated that it was the new tracks that were at fault.  Well it appears they were not. In the early morning of post Xmas I reexamined the audio settings of my TV.  Not those with altering the frequency response but ones connected to the speaker system. On changing my system to a dual system set to stereo voila the full tracks were reproduced. How this change can affect the selection of tracks within an individual tune I fail to understand. However I submit these details so that anybody else that is having such problems might investigate their own possibilities.  I have also revised my star  rating accordingly."
11794,"Amazon",2016-11-10,4,"What happened????!!!! (Updated)   Updated 11/16/16 - I updated all of the drivers on my Dell laptop and now this app is working. I was having issues with my laptop waking up when I moved it to and from the docking station. Updating my drivers fixed that problem and appears to have fixed the issues with this app too. I also un/reinstalled it several times. Upon opening it for the first time this time, I didn't dismiss the banner for signing up for Amazon Music. I don't know if that is why it's working or if it truly is the driver update. I wanted to add this though in case it will help anyone else. :)**********************I used to love this app. My work won't let us have iTunes and now that it's been updated, it barely works at all. It freezes then fast shuffles through my playlist without actually playing any of the music. I have uninstalled/reinstalled three times to no avail. Also, it's messing with other programs on my computer now. I thought maybe it was something that happened to my playlist but I can't play anything. Opening/closing doesn't help, creating a new playlist (if I can get it to work long enough) doesn't work. Streaming from Prime doesn't work. It's causing me to waste a lot more time at work than I really have but I can't work without my music! This is all stuff I've purchased too so it's not like I am trying to get something for free or streaming pirated music or anything like that. I buy all of my music from Amazon. This is soooooooooo disappointing. Help! Isn't anyone reading these reviews that can fix it?"

I'm sure it is the fault of something else though, which explains the new player I downloaded played around 20 songs without missing a beat! Gee, I wonder where I should create my playlists? But Amazon Music does play music. It appears that the bulk of their programming efforts are in support of cloud access - I'm guessing, as I only stream music when on my wifi, and even then only occasionally. But that's okay Amazon, I found a new friend in music!"

I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! This is horrible. I am going to look for a different place to purchase music, I can no longer deal with trying to use this nasty, horrible, uncooperative, freezing, non-working software. Amazon you are forcing customers to use this instead of allowing them to choose how/where they want to download their music to/with. By forcing this nasty non-working software down the throats of your customers, you are losing customers. I refuse to purchase anymore music here. I can’t spend hours trying to resolve the problems with the nonworking downloads, the freezing, the crashing. It’s the end of my business purchasing music here, and I buy a LOT of music. I will also be canceling my subscriptions and other related services. It is hands down the worst software I have ever, ever, ever encountered. Again, Amazon, you should be TOTALLY ashamed of this product and what you are doing to customers. I have been with amazon for many, many years, I think since the beginning actually. Too bad... I am DONE!!!"
11801,"Amazon",2017-07-18,5,"Good mix of music   I did not know this was a feature of Amazon Prime! Pleasantly surprised to discover this amazing option. I love classic country from the 60's through the 80's and there is a great selection available! One thing I find slightly annoying about Prime is that you pay a premium for the service. Then Amazon gives you what appears to be a partial service with an ""upgrade"" available for another few dollars a month in subscription services. Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the Prime product, but the ""upsale"" attempts are annoying and make me feel as though I've been played by Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but this is not the way I would market the service."

11809,"Amazon",2014-06-29,1,"Again, Amazon willfully leaves committed customers in the cold   I want to start with this: my dad has nominally enjoyed the use of his Kindle Fire.  But I am continuously stunned by how Amazon continues to pour cold water on the already sputtering flames in their app store.  So many apps sit years without any possibility of a new update in sight.  Sure, those 3rd parties aren't pummeling me for data on every aspect of my life... But that's probably because Amazon doesn't want to share.Regardless of that fact, I cannot fathom why, on the heels of their announcement regarding their new Fire Phone plus all of the rest of their attempts to draw consumers into their ecosystem, they would not have a proper update for their Kindle Fire customers.  Not only does their weak app store show how they're catering only for the elderly-monied-suburban-dumb-phone-devotees, it also demonstrates how once they have those dollars they will make zero effort to be a useful platform."
11810,"Amazon",2014-08-02,1,"Downloading Purchases Is Slow and Painful   I'd been satisfied using the old Amazon MP3 app for some time on my Galaxy S3 and was recently steered into this new ""upgrade"". I don't have Prime so I'm not at all interested in the new Prime features. In practice, I like to download my Amazon MP3 purchases to my phone's micro-SD card so I can play them anywhere without needing to use a network though this has always been a bit more involved than necessary since the old and new app have no option for selecting a different download storage device than my phone's ever shrinking built-in memory.I have to say the latest version - Amazon Music with Prime Music  V4.0.4 - is quite disappointing. When I open the app to download new songs, it immediately displays a message that it is loading cloud songs before I even do anything. It is not clear why the app needs to load cloud songs or why this is taking so long because I have automatic downloads turned off in the app. Whatever the app is doing, it appears to slow the responsiveness dramatically. I then open my Amazon MP3 Library Recently Added list and tap the download icon. It can take a good 10 seconds or more before the app responds and begins downloading. Downloading appears to be much slower than in the old (non-Prime) version over WiFi. And downloading is extremely unreliable -- about one third of my new MP3 fail to download for an unspecified reason. After the list download ends, the app displays a red X next to the Recently Added list which can be pressed to retry downloading. This NEVER seems to work so I often have to scroll through the list of new songs manually, find each failed download and retry each song individually. This works for some songs but, for others, I have to cancel the download and then start a new download for it. During all of this, the app is excessively slow so it takes a while to determine if the app is going to actually retry downloading any particular song. And sometimes the slow response causes the app to switch modes and PLAY the song instead of popping up the retry menu for the song. There's no way to select a group of songs and then retry downloading, each song must be retried individually. After I eventually get all my songs downloaded to the phone, then I have to manually move them to the micro-SD card. Suffice it to say that this entire process is slow, painful and extremely frustrating. It is actually would be much easier and faster to remove the micro-SD from my phone and use my laptop to download my new Amazon MP3s directly to it. The only bright point in all this is that the app now seems to know which songs its already downloaded to my phone (the old version of the app would download songs and albums again and again and rename the files each time so it wasn't easy weed out the duplicates).Frankly, buying MP3s from Amazon and getting them on my phone has become much too time consuming and frustrating.UPDATE:Even worse than before. I'm lucky if I can get ONE purchased song to download to my phoneDownload Failed. Error: 1000THIS APP IS COMPLETELY BROKEN"

Hubs and I were both on our electronic devices with the Heavy Metal playlist going, and a Poison song came on and both of us thought it sounded just a little bit...off. Then this morning as we tidied the house with the 80s station on, ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard came on. Only it was definitely NOT Def Leppard. I was/am big Lepps fan (today they're more of a guilty pleasure, ha ha ha) and I know the album Hysteria backwards and forwards. The song I was listening to may have been written by Def Leppard, but this version was definitely not performed by Def Leppard. The vocal harmonies were too slow, and completely unbalanced, where they used to be tight and perfect, no one voice could be heard over the others.

First, create your own playlist. It's kinda good, the prime catalog is lacking, and I have yet to discover the magic bean that will allow me to add my local music on my PC to playlists on my phone (same account) that I can achieve VIA google music. Add to that I added 500 songs to my prime playlist.. It repeats the same 20 songs, I don't even hear some artists I've added.Then came the ""stations"" these in theory are great, Pandora killer I thought.. But holy crap are the stations HORRIBLE. lets try punk rock. I hear the same 13-18 songs repeated. Half of which aren't really in the genre. Lets switch to the stations titled ""Van Halen"" One van halen song, then you'd expect a high energy classic rock song, nope.. Lets toss on something a lot slower by abba, stevie knicks or Fleetwood mac. Yeah, they're in the same class.Long song? No problem.. We'll cut it off before it ends...Add to that the app likes to stop playing, then start again, then stop again.. When writing this review I turned on the van halen station, connected to 4G, it would play one song and stop. Connected to work wifi, still played one song and stopped. Finally rebooted my phone, Plays one song and stops.. Not the best app in the pool at this time. Absolutely doesn't enhance my prime membership yet. Keep trying amazon.."

11833,"Amazon",2015-02-28,1,"Why can't I organize my music like other music apps???   This does not meet my expectations.  I expect an app like this to allow me to organize my music and it does not.  In some cases I have to scroll thru all my albums one-by-one to find what I'm looking for.  Now if I want to pull up albums by genre I 'm out of luck.  It appears that in many cases Amazon randomly selects a genre that is not ever close.  If I want to listen to classic rock I can pull up by artist which is in reality the performer.  If I want to listen to classical I am again out of luck.  This app does not let you pull up by composer.  Clearly Amazon does not want classical listeners using this app.  I can try a search but that only helps if the composer's name is in the title.  I have tried creating playlists, not to listen to but to categorize my albums.  Once I pull up the playlist and decide what I want to listen to.  I then go look up the name of the album and pull it that way.This is all such a shame because my Kindle for PC allows me to create all the categories I want and to beautifully organize all my books.  Why can't this app? Who was the programmer on this? Clearly they were one of the few programmers on this planet that doesn't have a musical background.  Another solution would be to use one of the external music apps like Tag Scanner which is the ultimate in organizing your music and plays it too.  However all those prime albums you listen to, you would have to go buy so you can download them to your PC so an external app could play them.Amazon could easily reduce their customer's frustration by allowing us to categorize our albums like we can our Kindle books.  The code wouldn't be that difficult.  Just hi-jack some of the code from Kindle for PC and perform a little neurosurgery on Amazon Music.and you're good.

So far, it doesn't exist, because the greedy bozos at Apple and Amazon are just not up to the task."

So I copied a few of my discs to the hard drive and uploaded them. All the tracks said duplicate. Yet still not in the cloud. Even more frustrating they all show up on cell phone app. Even more frustrating than that, cant download from cell phone. Amazon all I can say is grrrrrrrrr."
11854,"Amazon",2015-10-01,2,"Passable...maybe.   Crashes a LOT!App is slow, search is sluggish and inconsistent. I can search for an artist and it will return suggestions but no albums by that artist, but when searching for a similar artist the first shows up as a suggestion?! Sometimes searches return NO results but when I search again a few minutes later it finds results.The app sometimes switches between Cloud and Prime without warning. Music stutters too much compared to other players. I can stream HD in YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix just fine but I can't listen to a song from Amazon without it skipping.The selection is limited.Sound quality is poor. I hear a lot of the connotation artifacts, that under water sound.At least it works okay enough to audition a few tracks before it crashes. It will help me make some purchasing decisions, though I doubt they will be made through this app."
11864,"Amazon",2017-11-08,1,"Been patient, but this app is worthless.   Amazon music app developers: get your sh*t together. I've TRIED to use this app on a galaxy S7 for going on two years. I like that I can theoretically access music as part of my Prime membership instead of paying for a separate subscription. However, this app hardly ever does what it claims to be capable of. Music skips when I have a full wireless signal. I download music, but it just loads perpetually when I'm offline. Today I tried again and got a message that my downloaded music had expired and needed to be refreshed. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN I TAP ""REFRESH MY MUSIC."" Reinstalled the app, made no difference. This is such a joke of a product. Seems like really lazy development -- you're not making any extra off it, so why bother doing it right, right?"
11867,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Amazon Music Unlimited Review   Amazon Music has a good catalog of information available.  However, the apps are missing many features that should be standard at this time.1. The experience between web, desktop, and mobile apps are inconsistent.  The feature sets are not the same across all the platforms.  Play queue being an example.  The play queue is available in the Android app but not in the web player.2. Last.FM support - The application does not support scrobbling.  I'm forced to use 3rd party applications in addition to the Amazon Music app to scrobble to Last.FM.3. Social Content / Historical Content - Amazon Music does not provide any information about the artist.  Other music services take advantage of social feeds, Wikipedia, Last.FM, and other sources to provide information about the artists and/or albums.  This feature is a major omission if you like to explore new music.4. Play Queue - Not consistently present in all versions of the application.  This is a significant omission for the web edition of the application.  This omission makes the user create tons of playlist for various moods / events.5. Favorites / Starring - I have no method to quickly identify favorite tracks.  The ability to thumbs up / down  or star tracks is sorely missed.6. Video Content - None7. Integration with BandsinTown or other concert tracking platforms.  If I find a new band...I would like to know when they are going to be in my area.8. Performance - Overall performance of the application / service, regardless of platform, is slow.  It is by far the most unresponsive application I have utilized for music sharing.  This is unbelievable as Amazon has built its reputation on its cloud computing capabilities.9. Similar Artist - Amazon Music seems to be tailored for people that either want a Radio experience or know exactly what they want to listen to...  Show me similar artist, records, songs.  Let me get lost in the rabbit hole!10.  Uploads - The ability to upload your own music is a nice feature.  However, I have found that the application performs even slower when personal music is uploaded to the catalog.11.  Android Screen controls.  The application is currently getting moved to the background on my android.  There are no screen controls available when the phone is locked (all competitors have this functionality).Overall the service is adequate.  There is a good selection of songs and the family plan is the best that is currently available on the market.  I signed my family up for a year.  They all hate it!  We will give the service a fair shake over the year.  If performance and some other features are still lacking at the end of the year we will switch services again.  I expected better from Amazon.  Okay is not good enough."
11869,"Amazon",2015-08-21,5,"Yup it'll keep me being Prime   Always something to listen to, new releases are released shortly after their debut, and the sound quality is very good for streaming with no buffering over LTE and wifi.  The overall addition of this service makes it a much better value than n**flix. I don't watch movies every day but I will listen to music on my commute, Amazon got this right."

I've used several others and this is by far at the bottom, which surprised me coming from Amazon. The way you upload a big library like I have to the cloud is atrocious. I have been trying for days to get my approximately 120GB's (and that isn't even that big of a library), up for days. On top of that, they should have an option to point to your music folder and keep track of your personal library and sync your library with your cloud, so its always up to date.Amazon, get it together."
11874,"Amazon",2017-02-20,3,"Great quality and selection, poor sorting and searching tools   First off, the sound quality and selection is fantastic. I would rate that alone at 5/5. If you listen to a large variety of music on a regular basis, the service is great.BUT, finding music, is a chore. Artists are easy enough to find, but actually getting to an album you want is tricky. The majority of my listening is full albums. From the album selector for a band, there is NO distinguishing between singles, EPs, or full albums, nor is there any note of year (year is visible once the album has been selected, but I've already seen several where the year was blatantly wrong, or listed the year of the re-issue, which is technically correct, but generally misleading). This is a NIGHTMARE for bands with several albums, especially artists who name the album after a title track, release the album, a clean version of the album, a limited edition of the album, the title track as an EP, and again as a single. It's common for me to ""view all"" albums, and it's 3+ indistinguishable links, all with the same album art and name.I've also had technical issues stemming from album selection. For example, from the ""my recommendations"" screen, I can click to an album, and I can add the album to my music, but from the band's page, that album is NOT in their list (specific example below). Furthermore, a band's list of albums is not its own screen, it's a kind of popup, so when I select an album, if it's not the one I want, and I hit back, I am returned to the band's main page. Not their list of albums, forcing me to repeat this cycle.For reference, the album I can listen to, but not find on the band's page is ""The Nexus"" by Amaranthe. I think the confusion there is that ""The Nexus"" is also a single, and there are two entries for said single in the band's album list, and I think one of them should be a link to the full album, but is not."

Look amazon, you demand all sorts of permissions in order to be on my phone.  You can remove prime music at any time from my phone. You can keep it protected.  You don't need to hog my internal memory.  I guess you are only for top end phone users.  I can't afford you.Listen from the cloud you say?  Unless I keep this app open on the front page, and don't let the phone display go dark, the music stops.  I get about 15 seconds of music, then have to restart it.So, I uninstalled the app, and guess what?  It took the music I BOUGHT from amazon off my phone.  Music that I use other apps to play since those apps don't stop every 15 seconds.  Amazon, I love you.  But I hate your music app."

Who on earth would change settings on their phone to open it up to all? I've yet to log on to my computer to finish downloading it into my Amazon Cloud, and haven't even been able to hear it yet.

11881,"Amazon",2016-11-08,3,"I turned blue when the app did... but Amazon listens   I used to LOVE Amazon's Music App, but with the recent change they eliminated a lot of features that I used and turned the app into something that is to me completely useless.CONS0) It's just slow, and laggy, and freezes all the time. While I'm uploading or it decides to download something (completely outside of my control) it can not be used.EDIT***Since the time of my originally posting this review amazon has introduced several updates that have incremementally begun to address my problem and I am so thankful for that. I had started using another music player but it is so much easier to have the program that i use to download my music also play it and it's great to see that a company as big as Amazon can listen to complaints and improve on products. I STILL want it to be a lot easier to remove music from my computer directly from the ap but they added the ""see file on computer"" option back again so if I really want to I guess I can use that. Thanks Amazon.1) On the new app they have this extensive list/filtering system which is mostly redundant and yet so complicated I hardly ever know what subset of my music I am listening to. Is it my OFFLINE music, on the CLOUD, filtered by download date... or is it the ALBUMS section with ALL MUSIC, yet only purchased songs ordered by upload date? There is NOTHING smart about this set-up and it only serves to obscure the next point2) I CAN'T STOP IT FROM DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING! I like to try out new albums/songs and support artists.. So I buy the album and keep it on the cloud and download my favorite songs for easy listening even without internet (yaknow if I wind up in the stone ages or something..) Maybe somewhere along the line I accidentally hit dl everything, although I don't believe that I did- but even so I can not find any setting that would be able to help me change that! furthermore they took away the ability to click on a song and find it on my computer which I could have potentially used to delete unwanted songs from my computer. AND NOW WHENEVER I TRY TO DELETE A SONG INSTEAD OF GIVING ME THE OPTION TO DELETE IT FROM THE COMPUTER OR THE CLOUD IT ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT THE CLOUD.3) It's now more difficult than ever to donload or upload songs when I want to... having me drag and drop songs onto the words, upload or download is totally unintuitive especially since I usually like to deal in multiple songs.. which leads me to the INABILITY TO HIGHLIGHT MULTIPLE SONGS. That is a completely necessary/useful option that I don't understand the logic behind taking out.4) When I click ""make a playlist"" from this song- nothing happens... I probably just do not understand what I was supposed to do maybe? But  I am fairly computer literate and a programmer myself so if I can not understand it I assume that most are quite perplexed.PROSThe color scheme is nicer... the icon looks good?I originally was going to give this app a 2 star rating becuse I think the aesthetics really were an upgrade... but honestly there is such a downgrade in functionality this app is terrible now.. If there were any other way to easily download and listen to my music that I buy from Amazon I would be there right now.."
11884,"Amazon",2016-07-07,1,"Inadequate music selection   I was thrilled to see this app which will complement my prime membership. However, there is not enough prime music available. The app is mostly for selling music. I'd buy Spotify instead. I hope Amazon will improve the selection."
11888,"Amazon",2014-07-01,1,"Amazon Music sucks.   This app is clunkier than Windows Vista. Heavy, unmanageable, buggy, and virtually unusable are the strong points. At least Amazon MP3 was intuitive and relatively usable. The first thing this piece of trash does is hit you over the head with a pop up ad for Amazon Prime. For all the money I spend at Amazon, I don't need the hard sell. You already get most of my money. Until now. Much of my purchased music did not transition from old to new. When I called MP3 customer service, I was advised to re-install the app. After the third time and significant language barriers, I gave up. Amazon sensed a problem when I hung up after being on hold for the 4th time. I received a call back asking if there was a problem. I said no, I was getting established with I-Tunes at the moment. Amazon sent an immediate email giving me a $7.98 credit to be used at their music store. Wow. What's next Amazon? World peace? Fire this non-beta testing software developer, give us a usable app, and I'll come back wagging my tail. Final thought: Amazon, you have impressed me since your name hit the streets. The fact that you're shoving this drek at us tells me you've lost your way. Disappointed? More than you know. Wow."

Good quality and everything. Then a new update came out and now I cannot add any music to my library because they are all now premium subscription. Now they are trying to make me pay extra to listen to music that was originally free!? And I have so many songs that if I don't upgrade to this new premium standard I have to either A: one by one download every song through a new app. Or B: Be forced to upgrade to keep my music. I thought amazon was awesome before and now they are getting greedy and I guess my money for prime is now not enough. Very disappointed"

Only gave this 2stars because my finger slipped when i tried to give it 1.Buggy and inconsistent, stupid, unreliable, needlessly complicated, totally unnecessary BS!!! I understand that all websites have a mission to make everything proprietary, but proprietary apps should WORK CORRECTLY!!! Remember the good old days when you could just buy an mp3 from amazon and they would just let you download it and enjoy it? Then came the mandatory cloud player, now the mandatory app. Every time i upggrade to a new device amazon makes it harder and harder to download my music library tomy harddrive. This app works less well every time ihave to use it. On my thirdvattempt to download my music to new tablet and half the mp3s simply cant download correctly, even though they downloaded just fine to my previous tablet 6 wks ago. Tried it on several different networks to be sure its not just screwing up due to bad wifi; network is fine. Never paying another dime to amazon for music as long as i live. Enough is enough with this crap."

It's always towards the top of the list for battery usage even if I haven't touched it all day."
11909,"Amazon",2014-11-02,4,"Great idea but still (in 2014) limited   Great idea but still (in 2014) limited: does not work in Windows phones (no app), tries to show the cover shot of the selection with often hilarious results (minor issue), and limits playlist size, which annoys me because I have classical, jazz and blues in one big file but can separate them in playlists. Loading ""songs"" is tricky (don't like calling a concerto a song), seems to work better with Windows Media Player references than with iTunes references (on a Windows computer), and most nearly dependably if simply directed to the drive folder containing the music files. I still think it is the most economical way to make a cloud protection copy of a large library, having first tried Apple's cloud."
11910,"Amazon",2016-08-28,1,"Total garbage   This app is horrible the interface is clunky and hard to use, for instance the song options in the music library are right under the slidy bar so you scroll down find the song your looking for got to bring up the options and it sends you wizzing off to some other corner of the library because you clicked the scroll bar! Total garbage save your self the frustration and just avoid this whole s***show."
11912,"Amazon",2016-05-19,1,"Does this have a point?   I have just subscribed to this assuming I can replace Spotify/Napster/Apple Music to stream music with. Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem to have a great deal of music. When using any of the other apps I've mentioned, I can type in anything that pops into my head, and the chances are pretty high that they'll have it. This thing doesn't even have entire catalogues of certain artists. Joan As Police Woman, for example. It has one Radiohead song. One! I mean, are they adding stuff all the time? Is this as good as it's going to get?! If this is it, I can't help wondering what its point is."

If you want to compete with Spotify etc. you need to at least meet if not exceed their functionality. Get a good User Experience person to take a hard look versus the competition. Its hard to stop the app from running all the time. There is no simple QUIT option in the menu. It sticks itself in your notifications dropdown but clicking X there does not quit the app. Sometimes it feels like an annoying mosquito app. I love Prime and might consider upgraded music option and cancel spotify, but not with this APP experience. Please get some focus here and fix the User Experience here on this app."
11915,"Amazon",2013-12-12,1,"Needs an OFF button, too.   I've only used this app a few times.  The sound is good and it's handy, but each time I've used it when I'm done listening and want to move on, I can't seem to find a way to turn this app OFF!  None of the usual ways seem to work, and the controls only seem to give the option to pause not stop.  Very hard to find a way to close the app.  I've ended up restarting my phone just to get it shut off a couple of times.  So although it's a convenient way to play the music I bought but forgot to download, I probably won't use it anymore."

11918,"Amazon",2014-12-06,4,"I think prime is overrated   The problem with amazon prime instant video and amazon prime music is that amazon removes media out of the clear blue.  One minute your movie and music are there.  The next minute they are gone.  without warning.  At least with netflix, there is a heads up of what movies will be no longer offered as part of their service.  Overall I think the amazon prime service is a ripoff considering what it offers.  The 2 day shipping is great but that part isn't always executed to perfection, especially when it comes to 3rd party sellers (marketplace).  You would have to buy a lot of product to really get your hundred dollars worth.  The media selection part of prime  (music and movies)  is barely good enough."

Putting on the app then having ppl witness as I go back to start up a seperate visualizer kinda...  undermines the app's quality....IF you ALREADY have Amazon prime because you like 2-day shipping and knowing your getting a great deal without sacrificing peace of mind....  then there literally is ZERO reason to forgo free access to thousands of (downloadable) songs available on Prime Music.....Unless, of course, you're from some bizarro universe, in the multiverse, where in 2016, people still pay for music you can access on for free w/ pandora, spotify, etc.Meant as a call to action rather than an insult, if u have Prime, do yourself a favor and check out prime music..... maybe also try moving away from your ""aol.com"" email address, if u still have one? Digital literacy is no longer luxury, but necesity. It includes trying out new things because you may find you like said new things.Last but not least, to those of you who are complaining about the app downloading ur ENTIRE library to ur device...  its time to tinker with ur in-app settings, because this app is rather light and agile for the range of functionality it has (and will def be the best once they add a visualuzer to the app, providing seamless engagement opportunities across user devices)"

Today I noticed Alexa was integrated with the app. This has been a feature I've desired for awhile now, however, you have to tap the Alexa icon in the Amazon Music app to activate the voice commands. I know it was probably no small feat to integrate Alexa into the app so I'm even considering my three stars a bit harsh. For the sake of experience I'm giving this three stars because of the Alexa integration. Hopefully this critizisam encourages even more innovation. The experience would be even more perfection if when the app was open I could use voice commands with Alexa when my phone was locked or unlocked without having to touch any GUI. It would make my experience with the app even more delightful if I could do that while walking my dogs or jogging. Hands free Alexa while mobile...now that would be amazing! 🙃"

So heres the deal, it by itself does not function on a phone at all, because thats the only place it works inside your Internal Memory.  It's like they adapted a less sophisticated software to rush it to the market and went with it.  They fixed the problem by making you discover through phone failure by reading reviews or by another means that they recognized the problem and really want to just sell you another app and download Amazon Apps.  You will need to download their Amazon MP3 Mover in order to move songs to your SD Card.  But it doesn't always work.  It leaves off artist names and titles often so it has a lot of bugs.  While the Amazon Player will not see the titles that it moves, the Android Music player will, so go figure.  I really liked Amazon Music Player until I realized what it does not do.

11979,"Amazon",2016-02-21,2,"Well worth the cost if you are not paying to primarily use Prime Music service or expecting the app to work everytime.   I've been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now and also used Spotify for my music service.  Last fall I canceled my Spotify subscription thinking Amazon's Prime Music service had to be at least decent enough considering I was already paying for it.  Well, I'm wrong.  My husband has already declared ""it sucks!"". But I don't listen as often and I have more ""mainstream"" tastes in music so I figured it should be good enough for me, but no.  Here is a short list of why I don't like it; The avaiable music is nowhere near other top music services. The app is horrible.  So much so that, even though it's essentially free since I pay for the shipping and video more than anything, I'd rather just listen to music I have already purchased than use the slow, difficult to use app.  The app is quirky and constantly loses connection or repeatedly needs updated for a new version, or just plain won't recognize stuff I added to my playlists via the cloud.  Plus, it seems like a lot of the songs that I want to listen to are ""re-recorded""versions by the artists that sound like a cover version of the song.  I've not run across this with Spotify or Google Play.  What's the deal with this scam?In short, if you are not a regular music listener this might be fine for you or if you just want to listen to the occassional song (good luck if you can find it on Prime Music) .  But if you like to be able to create playlists to be able to listen to on your phone while at work or working out, or want to listen while doing housework find something else."
11980,"Amazon",2015-05-25,1,"DO NOT WANT.   I just bought an album and went to download and while before I could just initialize the download directly into my computer files, NOW it is forcing me to download the Amazon Music App in order to access my songs. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong spot, but the options I once had before are gone. I don't care about whatever features are in this app, I don't need or want them. This takes up space in my hard drive and it's not like iTunes, Xbox Music (which is terrible by the way), or Windows Media Player aren't enough for me. I swear I am deleting this app as soon as it lets me pull my music out of it. To tell you the truth, this is such a pain in the butt that I probably won't download music from here anymore. 0 stars if I could!"
11984,"Amazon",2016-03-18,1,"Amazon misleads you to get you in the door, and then will not let you leave. Amazon Music = Hotel California   I have been a subscriber for years, and always fought through the hassles and headaches, but now I have hit my limit. Amazon Music says it can handle 250,000 songs, which is great for large libraries, so I uploaded tens of thousands of songs I had ripped and purchased over the years. Every CD I owned, every digital song I purchased, all of them of the last 40 years. This process took forever, but I thought it would be a great way to keep everything organized, and it worked for a while. Now the app does not work if you have more than 40,000 songs, so I am trying to get a local copy of MY music for home listening, and here is where the problem gets RIDICULOUS.In order for me to get a copy of MY music I need to download the Amazon Music app, but the app does not work if you have a library larger than 40,000 songs. So I go to the website, and it is restricted to 200 songs at a time, and there is no stacking. In short it simply does not work for large files. So it will take me about a month to get all the songs, and this is with pretty constant attention. What I find amazing is importing was easy, but 200 songs per download means Amazon is flat out creating a barrier for customers to leave the service, and I find this unacceptable. I spend over $5,000 per month with Amazon and have for several years. I am an Amazon fan to say the least, and this is the first time Amazon has disappointed me in such a large way."

12003,"Amazon",2013-02-14,2,"No ability to save to external SD card   I hate to downrate the app to two stars.  Overall, the app is a nice player.  Unfortunately, the app forces you to save to the phones (Galaxy3)internal SD card which in my phone does not have sufficient room for my music.  The app needs a way to select from the various SD stores in the phone.  At this time you have two options, root the phone and remap the phones internal SD storage location or copy the music files to the external SD (which breaks playlists).If Amazon were to fix that one problem I would re-rate the app to 5 stars."
12007,"Amazon",2016-11-23,1,"Amazon Music is Terrible   It is a terribly complicated way to upload and categorize music.  If you upload your own music it uses the Artists name as the main indentifier and if there are multiple artists it creates an album for each of them instead of seeing the album as a whole.  You can edit but the app is not user friendly in that it requires multiple steps each time you edit an album.  Unlike iTunes you cannot edit the entire album information all at one time.  It requires you to do that song by song.  Terrible.  I am not a fan of iTunes but I find it more user friendly then Amazon music."
12009,"Amazon",2015-10-19,3,"and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be   As far as the apps for Prime Music, the latest Windows version, latest Android/Chrome versions, and now MacOS version all all improved but still not as full-featured and easy to use as they should be.  There is no music enhancement such as any kind of editor or EQ. I'd like to see a sophisticated sound normalization and EQ option if possible.  The Prime Music uploading app (admittedly a separate app that goes with this one and should actually be rolled into this one)  does seem in immediate need of a major refresh as it seems long-winded and clunky to use.  It should be much more user-friendly plainly speaking.  As for the Prime Music Service itself, well because it's free as a Prime member I'm happy for anything that adds value that I'd actually use and benefit from.  That said, Prime Music has a long way to go to be an actual music service anyone would want enough to pay for.  Yep, if you're paying your going to want Spotify, Tidal, or Pandora.  With these services you don't request to listen to Badfinger and get some nameless cover band ""re-recording"" the song which even if you were four or five cocktails in would sound ridiculous compared to the real song.  This is a real serious fault of Prime Music and I'm shocked it's even within acceptable legal limits, i.e. the song says it's ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger but it sounds like an attempt (and often a poor one) to sound like Badfinger...So, how can these songs be represented as THE song by THE band???  Here's the bottom line:  If Amazon Prime Music is going to be anything other than a free music service (which Amazon hopes keeps Prime customers re-upping due to value)  Amazon is going to have to really get access to a VERY LARGE music catalog and do away with the ""bait and switch"" SOUNDS BAD RE-RECORDINGS.  And speaking of sound, the fidelity of actual sources are sometimes noticeably not the best (it's likely the source and not the streaming quality itself), I think Amazon needs to raise the fidelity a noticeable notch too.I've been critical because I do like the fact I can create a playlist of mostly free songs in the cloud.  They can be ones Amazon offers as part of Prime as well as my purchases and uploads.  This is the best part and I like it.  If Amazon will put some of it's muscle and money behind this service it will be not only for current Prime members but will bring an avalanche of new Prime customers."
12012,"Amazon",2015-08-12,4,"Good service, but...   I love this service. It could use some tweaking as far as getting to know my tastes, but I think maybe I need to use it more. The only reason it's not 5 star is because they don't have a whole lot of new using available to listen to for Prime memebers. Otherwise in an are where I have internet, the service works seamlessly and the sound is pretty good."
12017,"Amazon",2016-07-08,5,"Good User Interface, and quickly growing selection.   I really like Amazon Music.  I've been using it for about 6 months and it's finally starting to become a viable replacement for Spotify and Pandora and whatnot. It doesn't have quite the music selection as its competitors, but it has enough to keep me happy.At first there were some design flaws that made things a bit confusing, but they've been constantly making small adjustments that have made the whole experience very simple to use.Also, I'm really happy they've been adding more classic Prog Rock, like Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Yes and some of the newer stuff like Between the Buried and Me, Opeth, The Mars Volta.  Can't wait to see more of that and other Prog Rock.The selection keeps getting better every week.One thing I'd really like to see is a higher bit rate option.  I think it'd be a really nice feature, although the music does sound pretty decent as is.Also gapless playback, if possible. With alot of prog, songs weren't designed to have a pause between songs; they just keep playing."
12019,"Amazon",2017-10-05,5,"Amazon Music, is another shining example of the rich features afforded the members of Amazon Prime.

I was pleasantly surprised at all the well thought out features and the wide selection of music from all genres . I have an MP3 player and I plan to load it with music from my play lists in Amazon Music. For us Baby Boomers, we can listen to and enjoy all the legendary mucic of our time."

I just love Amazon! I used to be an eBay customer but Prime offers so many benefits that the competition can't compare.

It is extremely frustrating and I would not consider this app or service when deciding to purchase Amazon Prime, because it is so unreliable.If this was a free service, I would expect some issues occasionally.  I expect so much better from Amazon.  Maybe Wal-Mart or one of the other competitors that Amazon used to dominate will jump in and make an app that just simply works."

So every time I'm done with an album, I have to completely close and re-open the program. This is extremely frustrating, especially when listening to complilations because....2) Compilations are not grouped under one album. Every single song lists the exact same album name, yet Amazon MP3 creates a separate album for every artist. So you can't just click on an comp and let it play. You have to go back and choose a new song every time, which is maddening when you consider problem #1 above. I'm guessing Amazon would respond that there's something in the metadata that doesn't flag it as a comp, but come on. If I'm in album view, just combine the albums with the same name."

Having purchased a samsung Tab Pro 10.1 I was hppy to find my old friend Amazon Music available for Android. Iinstalled it, and once i figured how to download my favorite albums Iwas in hog heaven, until my tablet suddenly stopped being able to download anything.The idiot app was stashing all downloaded music in device storage, so my puny 16Gb of device storage ws all gone while my 64Gb of SD memory was sitting gloriously empty except for some pictures from the camera and some tunes I'd burned via USB from my PC, which went to sd memory as God intended. This behavior continued despite me moving the app to SD. Happily, bringing up the app's on-device list allowed me to easiy delet about 3Gb of music I didn't really need, so I was able to download a bit more stuff I really DID want with some room left over for apps and whatnot.Since the app cleverly hides the downloads from the outside world, I am unable to transfer the music to a less horrendously unreasonable location. GRRR! Since I spent a very long career as a software developer for a top flight skunk works, poory designed software makes me VERY angry, VERY angry INDEED! If it wasn't for this rabidly user hostile feechur, I'd have cheerfully given this this a 5 rating! I'll be transferring 20 gig or so of tunes from my PC to the SD chip - thank heaven Amazon Music is able to see and use such files.One other small quibble: unlike the PC version, there's no volume control in the app - you have to tweak the system volume. A small thing, but inconvenient."

I am disappointed because the app won't allow me to save music on external memory (micro sd card) - which limits/kills the Amazon Prime perk of downloading for offline listening!While you can transfer/put your own music from your PC to the external memory card, anything that comes through the Amazon Music app will only be stored in the main memory. In my case, my 8GB phone (Moto G LTE) will run out of space quite quickly.Athough my android Android 4.4.3 KitKat shows the move app option, it does not work!I am seriously looking into a different ecosystem which has an app that allows me to store music on the external micro SD (32 GB).

This aspect of personal music storage is a huge selling point for Amazon Prime Music versus online streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Commercial free music is great, but I want to use the music that I already have.

This is my second time since its original release.  But it just lacks common sense features that other streaming services provide.Pro: One very nice feature that stands out above the others is Amazon’s x-ray.  Lyrics display during a song.Con: Amazon Prime is hard to use.  Everything is centered on either an Artist or a Play-List.  Where others like Pandora, Spotify, and etc have something called a Station.  A station is similar genre music.Search for an Artist in Amazon, you get a list of Singles and Albums for that Artist.  Now what?  Play one song and search again?  I personally never want to listen to more than one song of a given Artist.  I want Random.You can make your own Play Lists.  But that is just too completed to listen to random music of a genre.  You can select a preexisting Play List.  There are some nice preexisting lists.

12162,"Amazon",2014-07-21,1,"Eats data like it tastes good.   I've been using one version or another of the Amazon Music Player app for the past three or so years.  I've generally been happy with it, found it fairly easy to navigate, and I'm not super tech savvy.  My biggest complaint was the need to change any of the .wma files on my computer to mp3 in order to import them to the cloud library simply because it's a pain in the rear (apparently my files couldn't be matched in the Amazon catalog...odd since some songs from an album would be matched and import while others from the same album wouldn't).  My second biggest complaint was that every time an update would come out, it would change the interface on my phone and I'd have to re-learn where everything was again.  But overall, manageable and fine.Then my phone recently updated to 4.0.4.Which has sucked.  I spent the extra money to import non-Amazon music, greatly expanded my library, and looked forward to the ease of use to which I had become accustomed.  I've found that since updating, my data use dedicated to this app has skyrocketed for no discernible reason.  I'm not a big data consumer.  My average data use over the past year or so doesn't usually exceed 200-250 mb in a month.  I'm on Wi-Fi more often than not (at home and at work, so I'm usually only streaming 3g/4g in the car).  Yesterday, I received an alert from my service provider that I'm close to exceeding my monthly data cap...this app has used over 700 mb of data.In 4 days.When I'm not using the app, I close it.  It restarts itself.  I close it again.  It restarts again.  And it apparently runs in the background ALL THE TIME despite my efforts to turn it off.  Top it off with an obscene amount of buffer time I've never had before, and I'm not just disappointed with the app.  I'm pretty well disgusted with it.  If I'm in my car, I can't fast-forward through a song without minutes worth of dead air because it's still buffering.  It sometimes even happens on Wi-Fi.I've now used my settings so that it will only stream on Wi-Fi.  Which renders it useless for long car trips...a purpose for which I've used it for some time with no prior issues.Given that I paid actual money to be able to use this with more of my personal library, I won't likely abandon it right off the bat.  I'll take the time to find something I like better, transfer my library (again), and move on.  In the meantime, I'm peeved because I need to manage what little data I have left carefully for the rest of the month and trust that this app won't just ignore my settings and keep running itself and eating my data.Sad for an app I've previously enjoyed and recommended to others.  That won't be happening again."

The thing that upsets me the most is their android widget. It's useless and bad never been updated.

Prime music allows me to an almost unlimited choice of music without having to pay for every single song or album. If you like to listen to different music genres and don't want to pay a bunch of money to have it then give Prime music a try."

When clicking thumbs down, I wish it gave the option to  permanently exclude the artist from my station.  I don't like Nickleback and I keep pressing thumbs down only to have another Nickleback song play later on.  2.)  When creating Playlists, I wish it the had the capability of slecting songs from your cloud library AND your offline library for the same playlist.  3.) My favorite station  never stays up top and sometimes I have to search for the station I was listening to an hour ago.  Can we ""favorite"" stations and create a list?  4.) When listening to stations, I often will hear the same songs over and over within an hour or two but yet songs I hit the tumbs up for could take days until I hear them again.  That's just baffling!"

I get it; they're giving me a free app, that's their call. But the app struggles to find the MP3s that are already on my phone, and the music files I download from Amazon are in a proprietary format that other players can't recognize. Also, I have no control over the location of that music. Overall, it feels like this app is trying to control my experience in a way that other music players don't. If you really only get your music from Amazon Prime, then this is a great option. If you have a large collection of MP3s from multiple sources, then this app is more trouble than it's worth."

See where I work they won't allow us access to the cloud so having songs on my S3 is important to have my music on my device.  Amazons update has lost 500 songs that I can't play.When I contacted Amazon they said clearcache. When that didn't work they said to refresh the cloud.  When that didn't work they said uninstall and reinstall.  Now they want me to call them and troubleshoot the app problem with them.Um excuse me but it id your app that has the problem, not me.

I have also noticed, the sound quality on Amazon music is way better and louder then when I listen in the Apple app. The bottom line: Ditching Apple iTunes like a bad habit, switching everything over to Amazon, and I may even add a cloud subscription so I can upload all of the stuff I have purchased from iTunes over the year to have it in one place. Please, please, keep it good and continue adding more music, and don't feel the need to copy Apple. Apple let its success got to its head and is on the decline, this is a breath of fresh air."

I can't seem to get it to make a post to my Facebook account to show what I'm listening to (not a huge loss there).  Navigation can be frustrating on a device.  The web interface is a bit better.  Give me an option to see my cloud music and also separate my owned music from my Prime favorites.  That would help me a bit.  Also, how about letting me pick a genre and just start playing songs in random order.  Kinda like a radio.  I'd love to be able to thumb up/down a song in that mix to skip that type of music.** Updated on 11-14-2014The Android app has gotten very good (a new phone also helped).

You can select to display the music in the Cloud, previously downloaded to the device, or access the Amazon ""Store"". The app also allows downloading your Cloud stored MP3 files to your device but, as other reviewers have noted, it does not allow you to select where they are stored (i.e. to your SD card). The download location shortcoming is not a significant issue for me since I don't have a lot of music files, but this would be an issue for someone like my daughter who has hundreds of files.The ease of use and access to the Cloud stored files makes this a good choice for my needs.Recommended!CFH"

I deleted some songs off my phone and wanted to re-download them, only to find out that the option isn't available because on the app it lists it as already being downloaded. Not only that but the partner program on the computer has to have the most needlessly complicated way of uploading music to your Amazon music library, and that's if it even works. Literally worked fine the day prior, and now the program is barely running, and when it finally does run when I try and drag the songs I wanted to upload into my library, it says no songs were added."

It is far too complicated to go backwards and ""like"" a song and often ends up in repeating a song over or restarting the song I was listening to.  Pandora is much simpler to use.  I also am disappointed in my ""cloud"" albums.  I've bought MANY a CD from Amazon before streaming became the ""thing"" and VERY few albums are actually available to listen to.  I originally thought the idea that my music that I've purchased over the years being available to be all the time without having to load up space on my phone or always carry my iPod around was a great idea, now with such limited choices, I'm no longer impressed.  My other REAL ISSUE with this app is its own incompatibility with Amazon Fire Stick.  Why in the world would amazon make an App that isn't compatible with one of its own devices?"

Before you can listen to songs you must ""add"" them to your library which then forces you to go to another screen to listen to them.  What if you just want to listen once?The mobile app doesn't allow you to search by Artist.  SERIOUSLY?They need to drop the shopping cart idea and take a good look at Google music.  I don't want to jump through hoops to listen to music, It should just work with little effort.  This is coming from someone who works in IT; sure I can figure all this out but I shouldn't have to.

Really have trouble believing that this use case wasn't brought up in the process of developing the android app as storing music and other media on the SD Card is very common.  I can guess that storing stuff on the SD Card (world readable, 777 all that) is likely at odds with whatever deals they struck to 'protect' the music (I'm guessing files are not DRM'd, but rather they are relying on some File System level protection on the internal storage ... kinda mixed feelings there).  All the same, I hope Amazon gets that this model/method won't last, not at least for Android deployments.Also, I find the new 'prime' interface rather complex for what should be a pretty straightforward app. Oft times, I just want to see What's on my phone and make a playlist from that ... and it can be rather difficult."
12307,"Amazon",2015-06-02,1,"0 Stars should be an option   It interrupts at intervals of 10 seconds to a couple minutes to load a song, meaning it sometimes takes 10 minutes to play a 3 minute song. This is on a T3 connection at 2:30 p.m. CST, so no peak times or slow connections can explain this away, so the streaming function is worthless. Add that to the fact it is very hard to even find your music and that the user must be very careful to not be tricked into buying songs even though Amazon advertises it as ""Free"" music.

A solid Cloud service, great value - especially now that annual price for Unlimited storage is under $60!  The caution I have is that - with large music libraries, up and downloads take significant time - even on very high speed connections (I have Verizon FIOS 50MBS bidirectional and Gigabit WiFi).It is best to clean all your files and ensure correct MP3 tags are in place BEFORE you upload - otherwise, the service automatically modifies tags while upgrading the music file quality.  I found this especially true for audio books in MP3 format - in particular.This is an outstanding value and it makes your music available to any of your Windows, Android, iPad or similar devices.  thanks !!!"

12430,"Amazon",2016-03-04,4,"Almost 5 Star! More Clean Options Please   I really enjoy the use of the app & service. M only reason for not rating 5 stars is that I have not seen much ""clean"" hip hop nor are there a lot of ""clean"" hip hop stations.I share a lot of 90's music with my kids (and they like it more than a lot of contemporary stuff) but I like to do so with radio/clean edits. Cursing isn't allowed in our home and although I'm sure they hear/see others doing it, we have that as a standard in the house.My music collection theory is:Variety - YES! • Foul Language - NO!"

I have a smart phone without a data plan, so I have music saved to the memory on my phone; accessible when I am not in wifi range.  It worked wonderfully as my ""ipod"" until Prime Music launched.  My phone updated the app, and a massive amount of music was suddenly available for my listening pleasure.  Great in concept!  But, the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience.  Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago, it now takes MINUTES for a song to play.  I give up on it working, put it back in my pocket, and a few minutes later hear the song take off.  Skipping ahead?  Nope.  Pausing?  Yeah, that works well still.  Why does the new version affect songs that are stored to my device?  I don't understand it."

It's hard to find recently added music. I also think amazon has made it more difficult to easily add music to itunes. Often duplicate files download, and I can't seem to keep that from happening. I am not a novice digital music buyer or user. I've been buying my music from amazon for about 10 years. Every time they update a music app, it's buggy and bulky."

12439,"Amazon",2012-04-25,2,"I want to like it... but   I have to say the program on my Droid 2 is sluggish and locks up occasionally.  Its also a major power drain listening to music on the cloud... so if you want to listen to it on the train to work understand that your phone will die quickly.  Convenience of being on the cloud vs. an ipod that won't drain your phone battery (and stay charged for much longer.)  I don't see the point?  You could load the music onto your phone.. but many of us have more music that storage on our phones...Playlists:  Welcome back to 1989 when you have to manually figure out and organize your playlists and upload them to the cloud (instead of making a mix CD or tape).  No automatic playlists based on a song you like.  You have to manually add each song to the list to make a playlist.  I use Itunes and MediaMonkey (with some apps installed) to help create auto playlists.  Or I make the playlists manually on one of those programs and then upload them to the cloud.  What a hassle.  There should be some sort of technology that can make auto lists.  Not all auto playlists are good I know but Amazon has nothing but the most basic playlist creator (on the browser-based cloud player).  I keep going back to Google Music because of the ease of making lists and not having to go to Amazon and have to listen to old playlists or entire albums....  I haven't dared try to make a playlist on the app due to it locking up when I scroll through my large library.  I don't know if it's even possible.Uploading songs:  Google has a small program that stays open and looks for new music on your PC and uploads them automatically to the cloud.  Amazon you have to remember to sync your music and playlists.  There is an option to only select a few folders but honestly I end up rescanning my entire Itunes music library to make sure I don't miss anything.  And my hair is quickly going grey every time I forget and close the browser when the compare part of the upload process is going on and you have to start from scratch (yes, it scans your entire library and the library online to figure out what to upload to the cloud prior to even uploading anything.  It's a chore and takes a long time.)  Never mind the fact that there are hundreds of dupe songs uploaded everytime I sync.Genres:  I'm a nut about tagging my music.  I will tag my music separating the tag with a "";"" for each tag.  Amazon doesn't recognize this and now I have 736 different Genres.  Useless.Pluses:  You can buy music on Amazon and it's there ready to stream on the app immediately.  If you get your music from other sources you have to wait until you get home, download the music to your hard drive then start the whole manual upload to Amazon to get it there...Large storage space to allow me to upload everything (and I mean a lot) in my music library."

Amazon can keep the money I spent before on music. I am sticking with my Google Play Music subscription."

So far, for the value, as a student account getting this for $5 a month, its  good value, along with the TV/Video/Shipping etc...HOWEVER, I am thoroughly unimpressed with the overall quality of the music streamed from the cloud. There is NO EQ that I can find, and not control over bit quality for those wanting less or more quality. It shows duplicates in the lists. It showed Joe Satriani under Steve Vai's artist filter. There is a fair amount of choice. There is no way to share or auto post ""What I am listening to""  to FB, or Google+ or Twitter. There are no skins or way to get a smaller compact player. The one option is not much of an option and still too big, and lacking basic info. There is potential here, but as it stands I can get my music by other means once I am no longer in school."
12449,"Amazon",2013-02-01,5,"A great app that I use every day   I cheered when Amazon started selling MP3 music a few years ago. It was time for Apple's iTunes to get some serious competition, and Amazon's MP3 store has done that.

12477,"Amazon",2017-02-26,1,"Terrible service don't waste your money.   Sucks on my Android phone, even at home on a fast wifi connection it is constantly stopping to spool download music.  Useless on the road with a good 4G connection, it will never finish a song without stopping.  Don't pay for the $7.99 subscription as the library of music has shrunk.  The desktop app is just as bad with a limited selection of mostly very old stuff and albums that never made the top 25 of the music charts."

I have three tablets and two phones linked to my Amazon account, and this app is incompatible with all of them (one is even a kindle!) Seriously!? Great 'benefit' of my prime subscription that I can't even use the thing. Sure, I could use the PC app and listen at my computer, but I rarely listen at my computer. Most of music listening is done while working outside or driving. I'm usually against the all caps screaming in reviews but... AMAZON FIX YOUR APP, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!Though, from the sounds of all the other reviews, I'm better off not having it on my devices to begin with. Guess I dodged a bullet? Seriously reconsidering my prime subscription now."

12484,"Amazon",2015-05-21,1,"Like being back in the 90's   Amazon is a great company. Except for this monstrosity. I think that it really is the worst piece of software I have used in the last 10 years. Vile. Makes me want to find the name of the people who coded it and do bad things. Sorry to shout people- AMAZON, JUST LET US DOWNLOAD OUR MUSIC WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT YOUR STUPID ADVERTISING. IT'S NOT WORKING. Whew! I'm using iTunes more when I remember just how terrible this thing is. Go ahead, try it. You will see."
12486,"Amazon",2014-08-07,4,"great additional benefit to prime membership   As a free added benefit to prime membership, I have absolutely no complaints. Missing quite a few artists as I expected, but not too bad. There is currently no landscape mode, as far as I can tell. And being able to create your own playlist is a missing feature that I must have. But, as a benefit that I did not expect from Amazon, I have no complaints.  If I didn't have Prime, I would probably skip this."

Maybe one or two of my playlists will appear in the ""Recent Playlists"" section.. and that seems iffy at best.Also, even when the lists appear... it seems that AM is pulling the music from online, not the downloaded music I have.  This is annoying as hell as i get skips, etc that there should be no reason for.The recommended stuff lists are of no use to me... but there is no way to kill it.I think once my free preview of the service is done... i'm letting it go."

I'm running amazon mp3 on a nexus S. this app is great. cloud player works very well and sounds excellent. only issue I've had is with some buffering which seems to take forever but mobile reception is always a bit of a gamble. if I'm in a 3g area with full bars Cloud Player just works.I wish I could upload directly from my phone but that's my only gripe with the app. all the people complaining about how it doesn't work with their phone need to really assess the criteria that they buy phones with. get stock Android whenever possible."
12498,"Amazon",2013-05-20,1,"data usage was bad   I only used it to download 6 songs and 1 album. Then I played two tracks and the data usage was over 500 MB. The other app Google(?) registered very little. I guess this app would be okay when used at home or at a public wifi but I'm usually on the road. I'm an avid fan of Amazon (4 kindle purchases, Amazon Prime and the bulk of my online purchases come via Amazon) but  of this app? Not so much."
12500,"Amazon",2015-06-17,1,"Horrible application interface and annoying when playing music   I have many years experience in writing software and this app has a horrible GUI interface. The app has been programmed to interrupt every 10 minutes to retrieve and update the music library information on the device. it stops playing while updating. A totally dumb way to do this.it should update the library upon initialization and a control provided for the user to manually retrieve an update.  Amazon Prime Music would be a 5 star system if this application worked without annoying the listener. In my opinion the customer is wasting time adding prime music to their  device. Cannot listen to it uninterrupted."
12502,"Amazon",2017-06-12,5,"Easy-Peasy!   What a great app; free music and streamlined, easy-to-use menus are quick to navigate, and get you what you need."

12509,"Amazon",2017-01-05,4,"Free music - Great Selection   I really enjoy using Amazon music and it offers free music that I would otherwise have to pay for. Great to be a Prime member. Application is a bit confusing but not too hard to get used to."
12511,"Amazon",2014-06-23,5,"Love, love, love this!!   I've enjoyed Amazon Prime benefits for years and when Prime Music was added, I was thrilled!

12513,"Amazon",2015-03-18,1,"Screwed   So today I bought an album that I already owned while listening to it. Then contacting support who simply said that you can't return digital music. I told them I already have the album, along with 20,000 other songs. So on each one I can pick up my phone and accidentally buy it if I'm not careful. Also, no way to turn off one-click ordering? So I'm deleting and moving my music. I seriously spend so much money on Amazon, being blatantly screwed really makes me want to take ALL of my business elsewhere. It is almost like I'm sad that they can't just be better and have common sense. Can't they add a ""ARE YOU SURE"" button..."
12516,"Amazon",2016-06-04,1,"Was a decent app.   All of a sudden I can only play 500 songs on shuffle. I have 4100+ songs that I normally shuffle.I listen to my music in my vehicle and at work.It was shuffling fine on my old phone, but the new phone running Android Marshmallow  seems to have a different version of the app."

Great selection of music and I really like being able to download pre made playlists.My issue is that the app itself does not play well with other apps. If you have this playing with navigation running it will not mute or reduce the volume like other music apps do. Also external controls for skipping to the next track or pausing the music do not work. This app can only function as a stand alone and is useless if anything else is running."
12523,"Amazon",2015-02-02,5,"Music, music, everywhere!   I am really thrilled with Amazon Music. I started with the app for PC so I could enjoy my Amazon Prime Music benefits on my computer, but then added Amazon Music to my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire. I am really sold on this, and here's why:Being a Prime member, I can add a wide variety of music to my cloud storage for free, which is exactly what I did. Hundreds of songs - FREE! Not only that, but I also organized all of the music on my computer and set up playlists, which I realize is something that other software can do, but no other software gives you all of the advantages of Amazon Music with Prime Music.I've purchased quite a bit of music from Amazon over the years and all of the music was available within Amazon Music. How convenient! I now no longer have to cart around CDs when I travel - I just fire up the Amazon Prime app and can access the music I've purchased, plus all of the free Prime Music I can handle. There is a wide enough variety there to satisfy even my eclectic tastes.If you have existing audio on your devices, you can add it to the app and organize it into playlists as well. The one thing I've not been able to do, however, is combine both locally-stored music with music stored in the cloud. I'm not sure it's possible to do so. Even with that drawback, however, I find this app immensely useful.I noticed some other people are complaining about how difficult/clunky it is to use. To be honest, I thought it was really straightforward and easy to use. One complaint that I saw says you can't use your newly-purchased music unless you download everything again... I bought some new music yesterday and I downloaded just the new music. It was very simple to figure out and download. Perhaps the complainers had an older version of the app?If you are a Prime member and love music, I think you'll like this app. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
12527,"Amazon",2012-09-30,2,"Not ver functional   The app plays music fine and is easy to purchase music with, but it is not very good other than that.Be warned that you cannot set the app to download music to an SD card, you have to use the internal memory.

12540,"Amazon",2011-04-15,4,"Before You Scream, Click on AmazonCloudplayer Logo!   I have a new Droid X, & I have been kind of cranky because, one, I'm not that familiar with the phone, & two, trying to figure out this app was just making me nuts. After 3 or 4 days, I was much more familiar with the phone. I discovered, by accident, that some things opened under my finger that I didn't think were ""touch"" spots. Who knew?Once I figured that out, I started touching more of the icons and words in the Amazon MP3 Cloudplayer window, which opened things I didn't expect  to open. There's no *PING* light bulb over my head, by any means. But it was a valuable experience.I can't say that it's terribly intuitive; it's not. It just takes messing around with this app to get more familiar with it - the more you use it, the more things you discover.In fact, right now I am listening to a song by Billy Joel. But when I was trying to show my daughter how this player system works, it wouldn't do exactly what I wanted, the way I thought it would. Poo.After years of iTunes, it's just going to be a matter of learning a new system. I just hope Cloudplayer is more reliable about maintaining the catalogue of songs I've purchased through this app - so I can download them again in case of catastrophe. iTunes really completely failed to do that, despite their reassurances all your purchased music could be retrieved. I just hope Amazon's Cloudplayer system actually works in that respect. Hopefully I'll never have to find out.Now, I'm going to figure out how to get music from my MacBook Pro's iTunes to migrate to my Droid X, and into Cloudplayer. (If you hear screaming, it's just me, but I'll tap something that looks suspicious, & maybe that will do the trick. At least that's my evil plan...)"

That's just wrong & bad business! But I'll lose music if I try to merge the 2 accounts into 1 account. If the 2nd prime account had not been mistakenly allowed to happen  (yep - no warning!!!), I'd say this is a win-win & great. But instead I have to switch from account to account to access various music! That's what ""Customer Service"" told me to do because there was no solution. With Today's Technology - I don't think so, unless a software was made & not fixed.....I love being an Amazon Prime Member, but not having 2 accounts & loosing prime & possibly bought music too if I merge my accounts.Trust me I tell folks that it's better to be an Amazon Prime Member than to belong to Costco & such for countless reasons. This isn't 1 of those reasons.So get this app, but make it attached to an already existing account or build your account through this.The Subscribe And Save is Wonderful!!! Then there's prime prices & prime movies, videos, music & more. I highly recommend this, but with caution."
12548,"Amazon",2011-09-23,3,"Eh. It has promise.   Love the idea. I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is ""cool"", but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:1) Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I'm playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity isn't an issue.2) Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I've seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very ""tinny"" sounding. It's not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.3) Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. ""Random"" should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.4) Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere."

The idea was that I'd have all of my music available no matter where I went as long as I had wifi or a cell phone connection. The problems began right away whenever I tried to access my cloud using this app. Often it would take 20 or 30 minutes just to bring up a song and the app would crash multiple times. It was terrible! I called cust service and was told by the rep there that they have the same problem. Their solution? Download the music to my device because the app was unreliable. This totally defeats why I got the cloud subscription and downloaded this app. It sounds like a great app but like most things with Amazon they rush them out and their performance is not stellar. Unfortunate."
12556,"Amazon",2014-06-14,1,"Not so much...   Not enough to make me renew my Prime membership...I wish it was because I live where there is poor reception.  The downloaded songs are not all at the same volume so it is no better than the old Napster.  It needs a wifi connection so forget using it away from a connection like in the yard or at the beach.  The selection of ""free"" prime music is limited...and I like old stuff.Seems like everything I want to watch on Prime costs money and the free shipping is not really free since Prime items cost more...the timely delivery is the only benefit.  So....why would I buy Amazon's streaming device to pay to watch video ?  There are better alternatives for music and video service."

That would be fine, I guess, but then you have to wait around forever (or bang the app over the head by restarting it--sometimes more than once) until it dawns on the app that you have new music to grab.  Just let us download from the web page, already, please?  Frustrating."
12570,"Amazon",2012-05-15,4,"faq   Hi, my name is Gantulga from Mongolia. I bought my kindle in last week from Thailand. I'm so excited that I was able to hold kindle as one of the first people in Mongolia. But there issues which worry me that I haven't been could download cloud player, because of I live in Mongolia. Also I couldn't buy any book by my creditcard, there always signal appears me that ""your billing method is non-US"". How long it will continue that I can't use my kindle fully and losing so many great opportunities like can't download my favourite artist's song or can't buy my favourite books etc even i use Kindle Fire. I hope that you(Amazong) will resolve these issues for not only me, other many foreign customers who have stuck on the same problem as me.Thank you"

I see comments on this function going back for years and you still haven't added it? Are you figuring we'll all just stream? Do we all look like we've got unlimited data plans?

Given the initial bugs with their service, it took me a lot of work and time, but I eventually got my music on Cloud Player. After a few months, Amazon changes it to 5 GB. After another few months, Amazon states that there will be a 250 song limit but that limit wouldn't count previously uploaded mp3s.  Fast forward to last week: I tried playing some of the songs that I uploaded when Cloud Player was first announced, and I found that all of my uploaded songs were gone. The only songs that remained were the music that I purchased from Amazon over the past few months. Today I find out that your previously uploaded songs don't count towards the Cloud Player limit because Amazon moved all of my uploads into Cloud Drive where I can't access those songs from Cloud Player which makes it useless. Like many other people I'm not willing to pay $25.00 just because Amazon is being dishonest due to poor planning. In the future they shouldn't promise to offer services forever that are not financially sustainable, just to gain a temporary edge over competitors like Google.I can honestly say that I've been a loyal Amazon customer over the years. However if this is a start of a new trend with Amazon I guess I'll be shopping around for a new favorite store to patronize.I'm also sure of another thing: I won't be buying music from Amazon in the future. Conversely, Google treats my music files fairly. and that's where I'm moving my future media purchases."

A major improvement would be the ability to choose the path, or at least drive, that the music is being stored on. You cannot just move the files over to your external SDcard as you will get errors. Some have said that you can use a file manager to move purchased audio to an SDcard and it does check to see if their are in fact file on one."

This is so wrong. If I download it I should be able to play it by whatever means I choose. I cannot download anything to my device. I am sorry I installed and will never suggest this to anyone."
12864,"Amazon",2016-10-04,4,"Almost perfect   I really like being able to have the app play my files as well as the subscription downloads. I like having everything on my device and avoid streaming. Improvements I would like: The app needs an Android widget, and some voice controls."

12904,"Amazon",2013-05-11,1,"So much for having to quit buying CD's   I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I DON'T! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?"
12905,"Amazon",2016-12-30,4,"It's good, but could be better.   Random play still needs to be actually random. If I hit play from the first song on a playlist, the random set is always the same. Not cool. Also, opening the app never works the same way twice. Sometimes, I'm back where I left off and sometimes I'm at the beginning of the app with none of what I was last playing in sight."
12906,"Amazon",2014-06-29,2,"Wasn't broken until they fixed it.   This was my music app of choice until recently.  There has been a recent update to the software that kills a lot of the user friendly functionality.  The app doesn't remember where you left off in your play list (or that you were using one in the first place), forces you to set the shuffle and repeat functions on every time you open it, etc.  It's obvious that the app is meant to help you buy music, rather than enjoy it."
12909,"Amazon",2017-04-27,1,"Streaming fail   I can't stream more than a song or two before it randomly stops playing in the middle of a song.  Persistent problem across two phones for several years. Get it together amazon."

12923,"Amazon",2013-10-05,1,"Good concept ruined by terrible implementation   Make no mistake the amazon mp3 cloud is an attractive concept. But the current implementation is woeful. Lack of functionality means that the 'player' simply serves a (useful) role as a downloader from the amazon cloud. But given the lack of ability to direct downloads to the external sd card, you may as well not bother with this app. Shameful on Amazon that they *could* make this so good, so useful and so popular, but instead have chosen(?) to implement so badly."

I bought my first Amazon album to get the free $20 worth of storage space and started to upload all of my music to the Cloud.  Be patient.  It takes a long time (about 4 days, for me) to upload my songs.The app works just fine.  It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists.  The store portion is easy as well.

The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card. Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage."

The app requires an Internet connection to play your music even it is already downloaded to your device.  How it comes?  This is a simple function that can be controlled in the code."
13786,"Amazon",2012-04-16,1,"Amazon MP3 hindered my 911 call for emergency help   I would give this application 0 stars if that were possible.  It came with my Sprint phone and presumably Amazon paid Sprint so that customers couldn't remove the application.That's fine, I just never used it.  I never bought anything, I never browsed anything, I never even opened the application.Of course, that didn't stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when I was trying to do other things with the phone.  It also had a fun little feature (re: bug) where it would use 100% of the phone's processor for minutes on end.  I say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone.  I would, randomly throughout the week, find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power.Again, mind you, I had never opened or used the application.I endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience, I was busy and it wasn't *that* big of an inconvenience.Then then time came when I was driving and tragically, a car in front of me struck a pedestrian.  I pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg (it looked like his leg had nearly come off), scrapes, contusions, broken teeth, and most likely a nasty concussion.  The people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out.  They stood around looking panic'd without a sense of direction.  I got out of my car and dialed 911, spotted a street address posted on a nearby building, and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was.Meanwhile, my phone stalled and I waited, and waited, and waited.  For 2 minutes and 14 seconds I waited for my phone to call 911 while I slowly started to freak out thinking I wasn't going to be able to get help for this kid.In the end I did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel, get advised on what to do for the kid, and made sure that the people freaking out didn't move him (neck injuries people, neck injuries).But for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying ""I just want to go home"" over and over again.Later, after I got off the phone with emergency personnel, I looked in my phone's task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call.  As it turns there happened to be an application that I had never used that was, for reasons unknown, using 100% of the phone's processing power.Tell me, readers, which application do you suppose that was?  Go on, guess.Now some of you will say that I should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app.  I know right?  Some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings, voiding my warranty, so that I could call emergency services in a timely fashion.Amazon MP3 was forced on me.  I have never used Amazon MP3.  I WILL NEVER use Amazon MP3 after that."

You can still use it you just can't get custom stations. And if you are really desperate for some custom stations, just go to email and make a fake one. It will let you get custom stations."

The only thing I hate is that if you don't have an account for it you can't listen to stations that have all Taylor swift. However, you can still listen to music even if you don't have an account."
13873,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-25,4,"Seamless and accurate   I love this app. Iheart is perhaps not as diverse as others, but i don't care. Too many people think they need to be bleeding edge music hipsters; sometimes i just wanna hear Justin, Imagine Dragons and Jay-Z. You don't need, to hide, people. Be happily lazy, let a sophisticated algorithm(misspelled?) pick your music. If you don't like the pick, skip it! FREEDOM!!!"

I was looking for an FM radio app so I could stream radio through my phone and this was highly recommended so I gave it a try. What I found was an app that allows streaming, but only through a limited amount of stations (5). This may be due to my area or it may not. Good news is it's free so give it a shot and see if it works better for you."

You need to add Flash Player and the Kindle Fire will NOT download Flash Player so there is no listening to the radio on your Kindle.  I could try to reach Kindle Fire support by phone, but two experiences with their phone staff, they must be using an offshore support group that English is not their primary language nor the secondary language."
13903,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-23,5,"best radio app ever   Don't listen to the people that say u need a Facebook account cause u don't. All u need to do is go to the website on the computer to create an account so u can have special stations instead of the regular ones or u can just skip the Facebook log in thing for just regular stations just like a normal radio. It is way better then Pandora in my opinion cause u get to have regular stations plus the custom ones  u make. Definitely worth downloading :)"
13910,"iHeartRadio",2013-07-03,3,"Listening to Sports is Good   I do not use this app that often except to listen to Kent State University sports. The sound quality is good and continues to play with minimal buffering problems. Only really issue I have, and this could be with the channel I listen to, is that it seem there are about three or four commercials that are played every break. So when listening to a three  hours game this can be a little annoying toward the end."

I intentionally searched for obscure entertainers and found them.  While it does have a filter for explicit content, it is an all or nothing approach.  The ads are not as obtrusive as they are on other apps.  And this has a quick load time."

14176,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-12,1,"No Shuffle.   This app is almost awesome, but becase it's missing what I view as a fundamental listening function (shuffle) it is as good as garbage for me.  The ability to shuffle my favorite stations would make it a five star. Without shuffle it is just unrealized potential."
14178,"iHeartRadio",2016-11-17,2,"Just turn off   Once it is launched, you can't turn the thing off unless you shut down the Amazon Fire. Very annoying."
14179,"iHeartRadio",2015-05-24,5,"Great   This is a great app for listening to the radio. Even though you need WiFi for it, you could just lay around your house and listening to whatever you want to. There's like a million stations and you can make your own station too."

14186,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-27,5,"fantastic with no good local stations!   Not only can listen to regular radio programs, you can enter the name of a song or artist and make your own station. So far the app has recognized everything from the Exploited to Krokus. Then you give a song a thumbs up if you like it so the app learns your tastes. Radio in my area  is not great so I really love this app!"
14188,"iHeartRadio",2013-08-09,5,"Wonderfully Entertaining   I love this app, I have stations I like listening to in different cities and this app lets me keep up with them. I have several genre of music I like and the thumbs up and down really helped tailor things so the songs I really like play.Plus it has good social features, they can use some refinement but over all I think this is a wonderful app to have."
14191,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-25,5,"Bob   I listen to Real Oldies. Best 60's station that I have heard since the sixties.In my opinion, just as good as ""The Sixties on 6"" at XM, but it doesn't have a monthly charge.Minimal commercials."

14215,"iHeartRadio",2014-03-24,5,"great app   I've been using this app for a while now- probably a year.  It plays the music you actually want to hear, espically with the more thumbs up or down you give it. This can do everything pandora can do but is more user friendly, more visually appealing, and has more features. Highly recommend (love pandora too though)"

14235,"iHeartRadio",2014-05-05,5,"Best Online Music   Sometimes once in a while i may listen to Spotify or Pandora, but Iheart Radio is simply the best by far. I live in Califrnia and get to sit back and listen to East Coast music from New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Philly."

Also I need to point out that you do NOT need facebook to sign up or in. It is an option ONLY! Seriously people don't choose not to download something simply cuz others weren't satisfied and couldn't figure things out for themselves. If you do not have or want to have a facebook account then just create your own iheartradio login. It gives you the option for either or."
14239,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-26,2,"Not pleased with their choices   I don' t like the limited skips. Why limit my choices for what you want to hear. iHeart sucks on there choices of songs for your created station...to avoid skips Pandora allows you to make a list of artist that you want to hear on your created stations and makes there suggestions also...so I find myself using Pandora."

So far it sounds very good and once I gain more confidence in using the features my rating could change.  It does use more battery power than I expected but to have a good product there has to be sacrifices.  Thank you."

Pandora tends to crash randomly as of recent when it only plays for maybe 20 minutes. Its even been recently updated too, which is awful for it to act that way.

What I DON'T like is when suddenly a song, from another of my channels, starts playing, yet the picture shown is a totally different song.

15815,"iHeartRadio",2013-09-20,5,"Better than Pandora.   Don't get me wrong; I enjoy the other guy but with them they tend to repeat the same songs.  They also add songs that doesn't go with the genre of music that you've picked.  With iHeartRadio I haven't had this happen!  Kudos to the staff at iHeartRadio!!!"

18677,"iHeartRadio",2013-06-17,1,"This should be called I Hate Radio. It's junk. but you have to use it.   The fact that stations force people to use this POS makes me hate it even more.  I used to enjoy their stations via TuneIn Radio (5 stars, mobile radio done right) and these morons decided they didn't want to play well with others.This app is buggy. Takes *forever* to load. It has memory leak issues. It throws up stupid ads that mean one wrong touch and it's changing stations. It someone thinks it's lost it's connection. All sorts of BS.They tout it as popular. This app sucks. It's only popular because it's the only way to listen to some stations online.Rather than compete and make a better mobile radio product, they chose to be jerks and make a crappy one and not let anyone compete.Install it if these dolts bought one of the stations you like to listen to. It is or soon will be the only way to listen to them on your mobile device.  Prepare to be tracked and force fed ads, too.This is not a app written for a great user experience. This is an app written to track you and what you listen to and to make more ad revenue for these idiots at ClearChannel and Cumulus.  They're strategy is seems is to acquire stations with good content, micromanage that content so it's not as good as it was before, and then play gatekeeper with how to listen to it and force you into a sub par, feature poor, privacy exploiting, profit high experience."

I travel extensively and found this app needs a very strong internet at all times. I did find it irritating when  I would dislike a song or artist I would get bombarded by other songs from the same artist. I may be the only human on earth that does not like like Prince and Madonna, but after disliking every song that came up it would seem clear that I do not wish to hear their music. I do love the music from the 80's, however those two are not everything. If you could make the app easier to customize  l try it again. Thanks."

25238,"iHeartRadio",2013-12-09,5,"Best app ever!   I love this app so much! I think  It's better than pandora (I still use it and love it) because it plays more of the songs I love with less ads, and you can choose between Facebook or email. You don't need them either! I use it on my kindle fire and its awesome! I seriously think If u love music, you would get this free,cool, app."
25242,"iHeartRadio",2016-12-16,5,"Can't beat this free radio app   iHeartRadio is free!  Love that I can customize my stations without getting charged like everywhere else.  They offer a great variety of music and artists, plus I love hearing the artist bios/facts.  Keep up the good work"
25244,"iHeartRadio",2012-08-12,3,"Better than...   Pandora.  At least IMO. Took me a minute to start creating a custom station which brings me to my only disappointment so far, repetition.  While it's great that it looks for similar genre, one would think that with a db of 14M songs you wouldn't hear the same stuff within the first half-hour.  Overall? It's a keeper for me for now.  BIG BONUS - No ads every 2 minutes (or at all) unlike that other app.02-2013 UpdateHaven't used for quite some time. I'm all about TuneIn Radio these days. Stations from all over the world. If you can't find a genre to suit your mood, you're just not looking."
25245,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-09,5,"i love I heart radio   This is one of the best applications that I have installed.  You can listen to your local radio station or create your own favorite.

Something of a number or something else.  I'd like to delete or remove it and restart, but it doesn't even have delete, remove, or some other button for that.  Very Disappointed. And I wanted to listen to my radio program.  Oh well."
25275,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-21,5,"I love this app!   I heart radio is an awesome app. You can listen to live radio as well as create your own stations (like Pandora.) It features a sleep timer if you like to listen to music before bed, and an alarm to wake up to. However, if you are like me the music isn't enough to wake me up. You don't even have to be in the app to listen to the music. It is also good for finding new stations. It is completely free, and it's not required to sign in. If you love music as much as I do you should get this app."
25280,"iHeartRadio",2016-05-30,5,"Best update radio to listen to.   I love this radio station because it has so many choices to choose from and you can even build your own station by adding your own music.

I love being able to listen to most of the local stations out of the car while I'm waiting for an appointment or grocery shopping.  I also listen to a few national stations as well.  It's also nice to be able to listen to your local station while on vacation away from home."

25654,"iHeartRadio",2012-12-05,5,"I heart this app!   I love so many features about this app.  The custom radio stations one can build are excellent.  Just type in a song title or artist you like and a station will be created that plays similar songs.  You can touch a button if a song plays that you don't like and it will deleted from the playlist.  Like the song?  Click that button and it will play even more like it.If you want to listen to commercial radio you can pick stations from all over the country in any format.  As a Minnesota native who still follows the Minnesota sports teams despite living in New York state, being able to.listen to the sports talk radio station from the Twin Cities is a godsend!Some reviewers complained that they needed a facebook account to use this app.  I have not had that problem.  I simply open up the app on my Kindle Fire and the stations I have listened to or created are listed on the home screen.  Just pick one and enjoy.  This app is the most frequently used app on my Fire.  Thank you for making this available"

I spend far more time listening to this app than I do the radio anymore.  Very few ads really, just occasionally when I change stations.  Limited number of skips available per day, but meh, just change the station if you really can't stand that song.Now for the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  This is an older version 5.  The newer version 7 allows you to have a custom station of your favorites that you have rated.  This version is buggy or it just doesn't work because it will not load at all on my Kindle Fire.  The version 7 app from Google Play loads fine on my tablet and smartphone for that station, just not this version for Kindle Fire."

After trying to reinstall the App, the Kindle said that it was Not Compatible with my device. After jumping through hoops to reinstall it. We just turned on the Install from other sources button in the menu and downloaded an older .APK file of the App from the Internet. Using the File Manager App and going to Downloads, we found that Iheartradio installed the older version just fine. The older Iheartradio .apk file is available if you look for it. I just transferred it from my Windows computer to Downloads in the Kindle First Generation and it installed and works just fine. We don't have all the latest Pop Up Video Advertisements but everything about the I Heart App works great. The reason I knew that the New App should work is because we own two of the exact same model Kindles. The second Kindle was not reset and the Newer App is working Great with it. We hope that this will help someone else having problems with the I Heart Radio App."

25741,"iHeartRadio",2013-02-16,5,"Great to have!   Miss the stations in your area?  All you need to use this app are a password and an internet connection.  I've got stations from my local area, NYC, San Diego, and elsewhere. This is a must-have app if you want to listen to a Cumulus Media station on your device.However, this app does not stream international radio (I use TuneIn for that on my device)."

Kind of a shame, really, since the radio station I like to listen to doesn't have enough wattage out to reach my home. It worked on my previous Android Device beautifully.EDIT: Since getting the new Nexus Tablet, I re-downloaded this app. Now I can listen to my favorite Spokane, WA, radio station again...and ""Nights With Alice Cooper"" :D"

25773,"iHeartRadio",2014-07-20,4,"Its agreeable   It's good for the standards I was looking for:good music,any radio station I wanted,music from different states,and to just have music when I wanted!But there's a few problems that I had and they made this app disappointing which is:you have a a certain amount off skips for each day which means if you wanted to go through an artist's album you can skip through but you don't have unlimited skips so you have to wait through every song just to reach the next which gets frustrating,next when you look up a song they sometimes don't have the right one or they just don't have it,also some stations are not there,I live in Pennsylvania and I tried to look up a lot of our good stations but they were not there,so therefore it's a good app but it doesn't come to every extent you would like,there's probably many more problems and or many more good things about this app but trust me it's only good for the radio stations.PS-This app does include a great Comedy station,they are hilarious and it's worth listening too!*I do recommend this app."

25782,"iHeartRadio",2015-01-04,5,"Getting Better   I've always preferred this over Pandora because the ads are less intrusive (there are no commercials in the radio except for random times when you first open a custom radio station. Even then it only happens once, but most ads are pop-ups within the app itself). There is also no premium version that you have to pay monthly, therefore you are getting best quality already... for free! Also there are not only custom radio stations, but real radio stations all over the U.S. and Canada. Another plus over Pandora is the fact that you can &#34;tag&#34; a station (doesn't matter if it is a real station or not) as your favorite so that you can easily access it instead of searching for it every time or looking in your recently played section.  (As far as I know, there is no limit on the amount of favorites that you can have.) The more you use the program (there is an online website at www.iheart.com) the better it gets to know you do that it can predict your search! Even better is the fact that it has gone through so many updates and bug fixes that the layout is not only easier to navigate, but also a better quality app."

Then I found great jazz stations around the U.S. on this app, so all is good.The only downside is that this app keeps insisting that I signed-up for a pop-country station...the kind that plays big money bling country.  If I was interested in a country station, I would only want to hear old school country that is real...not the crap that is cranked out by the Illuminati millionaire machine.  Until a station like that lands on the iHeart app, I will keep turning-off the station that I did not add to my selections on this app (it keeps defaulting to that dreadful station...argh!)"

I love listening to different cities DJ's, preform and entertain the audience. I'm able to customize my own radio station with my favorite artist and groups.

This also limits my access on the app like voting, liking etc, but I'm Okay with that.This is a free app for purchase via download and install."

The selection and the variety was enormous. The fact that the signal was clear, not choppy or muffled was a shoe-in for me.  I'd recommend this app to everyone who wants to listen to music rather than commercials.The cons: I was putting my backsplash up in my new kitchen over the ENTIRE weekend and Every hour or less, I heard the same darn commercials over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the entire weekend; all 5 of them.  Well, thats the same thing local radio channels do but, every 15 minutes... so, I guess its a PRO CON.  LOL."
25800,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-15,3,"Great Access to Music, Lousy UI   Reviewing this app is challenging because one must distinguish between content, recommendations, and application's features, functionality, and user interface in both web and mobile versions. Overall, I like the system but hate the app. Here are the details.What I Like:- Huge content library that enables one to explore and discover lots of new music- Good album recommendations algorithm provided by EchoNest identifies relevant new albums to explore- Excellent Autoplay feature provides highly relevant new tracks (i.e., recommended tracks)- Web interface is very usable, providing intuitive navigation to the various featuresWhat I Dislike:- Mobile app's functionality is brittle; it freezes periodically, and can be slow to respond to user navigation. Buffering seems insufficient; momentary breaks in WiFi connectivity seem to cause major hiccups, such as ""hunting"" for the appropriate volume level or freeing the app.- Mobile app's features are imbalanced; on the one hand, it provides a great many choices for user behavior (social aspects, exploration and discovery aspects, recommendations at the album and track level, etc.) but on the other hand overwhelms the user with a great many options while failing to prioritize the important use cases by means of appropriate defaults and user customization etc. For example, I have zero interest in seeing what albums or collections are ""hot"" in my neck of the woods, yet this is shoved in my face as the default content in the left-side start-up screen menu that I cannot configure- Much of the app interface's flow seems to differ from that of the web interface, which is confusing- Transparent or ""disappearing control"" UI design in web interface, while trendy these days (e.g., Gmail folder scroll bar) , is a pain; scrolling bar disappears unless you hover directly over it, and since two-finger scrolling only works within the dynamic frame, you end up doing a lot of repetitive actions or hunting around to surface the scroll bar on a basic UI nav function that should be something you don't even have to think about."
25806,"iHeartRadio",2015-08-11,5,"Awesome Music App   This app is awesome when listening to music. You can choose radio stations like the point, air1, KLove, and much more. Another good thing is that u can search song by singer, song name, or album. When u first start u have to type in a Zip Code, but u can just skip it. And u dont need a Facebook account for it, your choice. The good thing I like is I can listen to my Minecraft music, Fnaf music, and 90's music. And u can search names if songs and stuff while ur still listening. The music will also work if u go on another game. And I have a kindle so while im playing my game I can slide that thing from the top down and cut it off, skip it, or pause it. And speaking of skipping the things, u have limited daily skips, I wouldnt skip so much and waist the skips. But see im only 10 so for me this is the best app for music I can get. But when u type in a song or name or album it has to be exact or it will say &#34;Song Not Found&#34;and stuff. But this is a great app for music and I recommend this app for all ages. Best app I can get. Get this app if like music."

As soon as I opened the app it'd open a random station I didn't even choose, it's super slow, and recently it's been telling me I can't UAE it because something from my app store wasn't updated! I haven't received any notifications for updates for your app of my app store whatsoever so I assume this is some sort of problem. This is the only app I know where I can put my alarm to music I like but it's not worth constantly being kicked out of the app over and over again just to turn on the alarm for any set of days and to turn it off. I'm better off deleting it."
25823,"iHeartRadio",2014-12-12,5,"Decided to try after hearing them featured on the radio   I also decided to give listening to the iheartradio  feature after seeing them featured online-through one of the local radio stations in the Washington d.c. area.  Anyhow, as in Pandora, iheartradio carries a wide range of music and stations to listen to. It is hard for me to choose whether I like Pandora or iheartradio more due to both apps containing a diverse range of music. Additionally, iheartradio has played music that has been a major mood booster for me during times that my faith and trust have been tested. I also like that iheartradio recommends other stations to try as I’m listening to their music. I have over 30 music stations in my iheartradio profile due to my diverse tastes in music. For instance, the don’t stop dancing radio station came into my awareness after iheartradio featured it to me as a result of the different music I have already listened to on their site. The number of stations and musicians that I have featured in my iheartradio profile could take up another review. However, here is a sampler of the stations/artists that the iheartradio app and website have allowed me to save in my profile; Madonna, pet shop boys, deppeche mode, tiesto, armin van buuren, calvin harris, 2am ambient, pitbull,dancin 90s, Britney spears , adam lambert, euro-dance, Darren hayes, foofighters, the 90s unglued, one republic, lasgo, Swedish house mafia, ellie Goulding, Fergie, robin Williams and many more that could take up the length of the minimum words required for another amazon review. As you can see, the app and website of iheartradio is perfect for those who enjoy a wide range of preferences in music."

Installed this ap on a kindle fire HD.The good:- price is right (free)- multiple stations for every type of musicThe issues:- Searching for stations is trial and error (I didn't spend a ton of time on this, but when selecting a type of music, then had to go by state to select a station - how do I know whether Alabama or Vermont has better alt rock stations?)- I get a ""click"" about every 10 sec - not very loud, but gets annoying after a while.  I don't know if this is due to my Kindle, my WIFI, the internet provider, or the ap, but it is annoying enough that I only use this for background music when doing something else, don't just sit and listen.Overall, worth trying, hopefully the clicking is a resutl of my set-up vs something in the ap.  If the ap, only useful whne nothing else available."

I now listen to Christian K-Love or the Fish while going to sleep at night. There is a sleep timer and an alarm built into iHeart Radio.

I need to add that the Amazon Customer Service Reps answering the phones (anytime day or NIGHT!) Are so professional, personable, and fast. Every time I've had an issue with my Kindle, Amazon has called me immediately and done everything they could to not only fix the problem but they show you thing's you may not of known about your Kindle and how to maneuver the apps and programs to make it suit your every day needs. They've never got impatient, sarcastic, or acted like someone needing help is a waste of their time. They are genuine and I can't say enough good things about my experiences. I myself am in the Customer Service industry and when someone treats me like there talking to a friend not a customer I want to continue to use and purchase whatever I may need from them and tell all my friends, family or business how great and easy Amazon is.

25886,"iHeartRadio",2012-11-16,4,"Good app, a few glitches   Overall this is a really great app. I would have given it five stars except there are a couple of things that bug me about it (using it on my Kindle fire).  For one is the commercial you are forced to listen to every time to power the app up.  It's fairly short, so it's sufferable, but it's still annoying.  The other thing is that the radio will just go off for no reason.  You'll be listening and then all of a sudden nothing.  Also, I was a bit confused by the ""create your own station"" aspect of the app. I typed in one of my fav. singers and thought it would play just his songs, but it didn't, it plays anyone that is a similar genre, which is okay, just was not what I expected.  The app is great especially since it's free and you can take your radio station anywhere in the house with you, which is nice if you don't have good radio reception."

Enter iHeart Radio. This app contains my favorite station so I can listen to it more matter where I am in the world. It works great with both WiFi and cellular data, and it plays perfectly on both my RAZR and Kindle Fire HD.

I'll probably play around with the preferences within the ap to see if I can get more stations to audition but I'm not hopeful.

I downloaded this app again on Thanksgiving morning and immediately started having sound issues again on the fire, not only in this app but in others.  I've deleted the app off the new kindle, reinstalled other apps that started having sound issues and things seems to be back to being fine again on the new fire.  My sister says she occasionally has issues with this app on her phone, so until Amazon gets to the root of my sound issue problem again, I won't be using  the app anymore.As for the app performance itself, eh, it's all right.

I will never go back to Pandora or Dezzer or any other music app and I haven't for years because I love I heart radio."
26028,"iHeartRadio",2015-06-24,5,"The best of it's kind.   I do love Tunein Radio as well especially but that is for everything NON Clear Channel. This app, owned by Clear Channel last I checked, is pretty much only their media and holdings, all on one place. Not bad for what it is.It is my 'go to' for listening into KFI Los Angeles. :)No complaints. The app works fine. I used app ops to turn off some of its permissions and feel like I can listen without being watched."

26035,"iHeartRadio",2015-07-17,2,"Disappointed   When I first used the app it worked flawlessly. About a month in (after some update)  the app would cut out for no reason and make no attempt to reconnect to the radio station.  Now the app cuts out  multiple times and I have to re-sign in and tap the play/pause button to reconnect to the station.  I use the TuneIn Radio app whenever this app acts up.  I would use TuneIn for everything but it can not play iHeart stations.  I really like my local iHeart station, but I can't stand how often the station cuts out and the app does not make any effort to reconnect unless you manually stop and start the transmission.... TuneIn will cut out occasionally but it has always retrieves the signals within a minute.  AGAIN THIS app does not seem to care about reconnecting after the signal cuts out."

26051,"iHeartRadio",2017-06-18,3,"Good, but   Good music, but no instructions.  As someone else did, I added a station I now want to delete, but can't figure out how to do it.  How do I get rid of something that looked good, but isn't pleasing to me?"
26055,"iHeartRadio",2012-03-30,4,"heartache on a kkndle   This is a good app for those who want to hear the same songs ovr and over again.  I got tired of listening ti a song that was my favorite. ""Castles in the Air."" Listeners can create their own radio stations by song or artist, if choose radio stations from stations around the country.  Trouble is, I began to experience problems with the kindle.  Running Internet radio opens up network sockets. I am not a technical wizard, but after running the radio the kindle would get hung up while I was on facebook.  I love listening to music while on the Internet, but nit ag the expense of technical trouble.  Download at your own risk."

It is also my husbands favorite way to listen to music as well."

I have had no problems at all with it. It is very crisp and clear sounding. The great thing about it, is that you can listen to the stations that you normally listen to in your geographical area. I'm very pleased with it, it is basically like listening to your radio; only you are listening on your Kindle.Hope that helps."

It was easy to just click ""maybe later"" and start enjoying content without giving any personal info. Today, I no longer see the ""maybe later"" option, and I can't access it without creating a profile. I don't want to create a profile, so I suppose I'll go back to online streaming."
26103,"iHeartRadio",2014-02-28,1,"IHeart Radio Too Hard to Use   It's a good concept, but I found it very confusing and downright impossible to set up especially where it came to adding or deleting favorites.  Also, I got stations on there from places like Baltimore, Boston, Miami -- what the?  I live in western Colorado -- what do I care about the east?  I was hitting the choices to see what would happen.  Once I got a station on favorites (always by mistake), it was futile to remove it from the list.  Know what?  I have CD's and MP3's to take with me on my road trips -- what do I need this for?!  Just more headaches.  The geeks that build these systems need to make them more user friendly to those of us who don't sit hitting buttons all day long.  Lastly, there didn't appear to be enough stations I liked, i.e., liberal talk radio and traditional country music.  I'm  not a  Glenn Beck fan, nor do I listen to hip-hop, pop, and all the other 20-something stuff out there these days.  We Boomers aren't dead yet, people!  Provide something for our age group or lose business.  Thank you."

First of all when you turn it on you get a 30 second ad which you cannot skip. Secondly, your last station may or may not be on the app without searching for minutes at a time. And finally when you go to rate the app at the Apple store guess what happens? If you give it a low rating the review mysteriously gets immediately rejected! Hows that for keeping all reviews positive! This type of dishonesty and unethical conduct is pretty much what clear channel used to be accused of. All in all its an ok app for listening to music but it is annoying to use and they dont want you to tell anyone about its defects."

Using only TuneIn I could listen to the programs I wanted live but from another city, but iHeart has some local stations TuneIn doesn't (and vice versa). If you're stuck with commercials, they might as well be for something that applicable to you (same for news & weather). Of the two I do prefer TuneIn, but additional choices is always a good thing"
26231,"iHeartRadio",2016-03-08,4,"awesome when it's not crashing!   Nice mixture of music and very low on adds especially compared to a couple others out there. Some of the stations can get a tad bit repetitive, but there's enough to choose from that I am usually content. The only issue I have is it crashes every once in a while and I end up having to restart the kindle. For the most part I can deal with that, just when it does it multiple times a day.

You can create your own channels, Pick favorites, and things of that nature. Pretty much doing what you expect of a Radio related app. It's certainly not bad at all and worth checking out."

It's seriously a really good app, I feel like I'm neglecting Pandora after the history we've had together.

Don't know if it would work with music,but probably not.My amazon shop.com almost never comes up on my tablet the way it should.

When you create a station and take the time to rate the songs (thumbs up/thumbs down) they play for you for a little while you will be rewarded with songs you feel as if you already know and love. The intuition of the algorithms is uncanny and wonderful. I am never disappointed."

There is a few radio stations I'm waiting for them to get and I believe there is only one artist that isn't on there yet that I like. I know they will be at some point though cause it would be stupid for them to not get on here with how popular this app is. AND it's free. How much better could it get? None!"

I love the fact that thee are no adds deception for every 10-12 songs but they are the type of adds that are just a picture.  another great thing is that I don't remember seeing an inappropriate add ever.  I think that if you want free music and/or a custom station along with the option of regular stations, this is the app for you.  also, the fact that this is a free app is even better.  although you have to create an account.  this never bothers me because the scouts are FREE.  if you want free music, custom stations, and regular stations, this is the app for you."

26401,"iHeartRadio",2012-03-07,4,"Good Radio App - Recommended   This iHeartRadio app provides access to hundreds of streaming radio stations covering just about every genre. While I used Facebook to register, it does support an e-mail alternative. I also told the app not to share any info on my Facebook page to avoid spamming my listening habits to my friends and family.That being said, the app works as hoped and has provided access to a lot of radio stations that play content I can't receive locally. The app installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.Recommended!CFH"

Who the heck cares? We are not all a bunch of mindless followers of the past, hanging on every little bit of info on every rock and roll bad who ever existed! It is mind bending and TMI. It is like forcing me to listen to 20, 30 and 40 year old TMZ episodes about music and bands if they existed.. it is awful!!! Stop it!!!"

I'm not sure yet whether it works off of a satellite or needs a cell tower in range. I'll be traveling soon and will learn more about it. Anyway, it works very well in my local area and it's free so that makes it better than satellite radio."
26493,"iHeartRadio",2013-11-26,5,"Pretty Great   This app is pretty great if you are looking for an app that allows you to construct a radio station that will play songs similar to your choice of music. If you're looking for a playlist or a Spotify sort of app, look elsewhere. What I was impressed by was the lack of ads that a normal radio station would have, so you're able to listen to a constant stream of music, even if you're unable to choose exactly which song comes next. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; don't give it a bad rating because you're looking for something else."

I used Pandora for quite some time, but the commercials are so jarring, and the variety is mediocre after you get about 30 songs liked. I haven't gotten to experiment very much with the iHeart alternative to that, but I'm hopeful. Also love that I can listen to radio stations anywhere in the country. Being 1500 miles from home at college, I get a little homesick now and then, and it's nice to reconnect with my hometown through music."

I don't have a radio in the house anymore so it's great to have the option of my favorite radio stations, coming in loud & clear, whether they're local or far away. Growing up, whenever I drove upstate NY, I always remembered tuning into a local Poughkeepsie rock station. It's still going strong and the music is still great!My only suggestion is to get more stations involved. Couldn't find one from the NJ shore or my old college station that now plays jazz."

26694,"iHeartRadio",2014-01-28,5,"It's great!   I love this app because you can create your own stations and listen to the music that you want. I especially like the 'perfect for' option, where they have different themes for different days. For example, Sunday evening you could pick relaxing, candlelight dinner, dancing, or video games music, but that's not even all of the options! This app works perfectly on the kindle fire. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music."

I thought maybe it was a signal strength issue till I streamed these changes from their web site and they played without issue.  If they could stream live feeds more reliably, it would be a 5 star app for sure."

However, they don't have some of the live stations I listen to all the time, and the alarm clock feature doesn't always work. Despite these minor difficulties, if you are looking for an app where you can listen to music, I suggest this one."

I had to continuously download the little shellfish app, but now my frets have been put at ease.  I adore the iheart radio app, to say the least.  Thanks to this app I can listen to music all the time, but here's the catch... it's my kind of music that plays for my moods.  And being woman, I have a constant merry go round of mood swings.  So thanks for the fantastic app, for all the Moody people roaming the Earth."

Sure, I have a facebook and I see my friends have logged theirs into iHeartRadio, but it shows what you're listening to. I'm not going to download it because I don't want my friends to know what I'm listening to. If you want my opinion, just get Pandora. It's free and all you need is an email."

They are very irritating, to say the least."

Even better, every device linked with one account will share the same stations. If I had one thing to say, it's the ads. About 2 of them come on every 2-3 songs.

27908,"Pandora",2014-12-13,5,"I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal)   I play this all the time. Only downfall is after a while, songs will creep in that aren't even close to the genre selected. I made a Motley Crue station (gotta love the 80s hair metal), and after a couple hours, Bryan Adams played. WTF. LOL"
27909,"Pandora",2014-01-17,2,"hard to access   I love being able to listen to music but the program is very difficult to understand how it works. There are not very clear instructions on how to get the type of music I like and put it all into a stream so I can listen. I don't want to have to have a tab for each song but rather a stream of constant music."
27914,"Pandora",2015-04-29,5,"Great app for Music!   I love jamming out to music, and I can choose who I listen to. No matter what my mood, Pandora has me covered."

27921,"Pandora",2014-10-01,5,"Great addition to PC and Kindle   I enjoy listening while I work on my desktop PC, and also on my Kindle.  I can create stations tailored to my likes and easily switch from station to station or skip a selection.  The thumbs-up/thumbs-down feature enhances music choices.  I'm enjoying it!"
27922,"Pandora",2016-12-01,5,"Interesting   Very interesting. I have only started using it. It has great potential though."

27933,"Pandora",2014-03-25,4,"Pandora   you program your station with the music you want and some suggestions from Pandora.  they have a larges selection of music and comedy to choose from.  you just have to watch how much you use this app because after so many hours a month you have to pay for it, but it is free up til that amount."
27934,"Pandora",2013-08-20,5,"A radio station to fit every listener   A very sophisticated way to listen to music. We can choose a style, a composer or a singer and listen at our own leisure. We can even assign thumbs up or down to the songs we want to listen more or less often. I loved the possibility to read the lyrics of each song or information about the singer, performer or composer. This is a must!"

I have come across artists I have never listened to and really liked what I heard. Only thing I would change is the amount of skips I am allowed. I think if I pay for it, I should be able to skip songs whenever I want. Overall I love love love this app!!!!"

27957,"Pandora",2014-01-16,4,"PANDORA with ads   It is everything it is advertised to be, free listening pleasure, with ads popping up fairly continuously before and after tracks.  I love it and will probably switch to 'ad free' some day.  For now it serves its purpose, great workout music and the best music the genre has to offer is offered on Pandora."

27983,"Pandora",2014-06-19,3,"disappointed   I created a channel I titled ""Eagles Radio"", feeling like listening to some mellow, classic rock one day. I have yet to have them play a single Eagles tune since I told them what I prefer. They DO play a lot of ""B sides"" by groups I wasn't all that fond of."

27995,"Pandora",2013-04-25,5,"Great radio station   I down load this station to all of my pc's and tablets too. Not that I have that many. But for free, you can't go wrong. The only down fall is that sense they upgraded it I can't or don't know how to get to the part where you create your own stations. Or create new ones or add stuff. Other than that I love it it is the best. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan"
27998,"Pandora",2016-06-20,4,"free music is great   That I could only skip a few songs before I was forced to listen to music I didn't like or wasn't interested in."

28010,"Pandora",2014-01-22,5,"All Music All the Time   I resisted paying for Pandora One for several years.  I enjoyed the service, but I couldn't bring myself to pay the price.  Once I did, I kicked myself for waiting so long.  It is so nice to just have wall to wall music.  I love it.  On my phone, tablet, TV, home unit. all for one price.  It is great."
28013,"Pandora",2015-11-12,4,"pause bug.   Whenever I pause music and start it, my voice input toggles on my Fire phone. It gets annoying because I have to restart my Pandora just to listen to music again."

28020,"Pandora",2014-04-29,5,"My favorite way to listen to music!   I enjoy many different styles and genres of music and Pandora will play songs from all of them and mix it up any way I want them to.  I love the control and also the 'suggested' artists that fit into my chosen artist genres. I only wish I could have Pandora on my car radio as well!"
28023,"Pandora",2013-11-25,5,"Good enough I'm now paying $ for it.   Not much to say.  Its a music service.  That gives me exactly what I want to hear and listens to me when i tell it I don't like something and would rather not hear it again.  I plug it in at work and set my stations and rock out in the kitchen all day.  It's great.  Great enough that I decided to pay for it.  :)"

28035,"Pandora",2015-02-20,5,"I dedicate this song to myself   I much prefer the advertisements to the limited listening times that Pandora used to have. I LOVE the shuffle feature allowing multiple stations to be mixed. Only feature missing is the ability to merge similar stations."

You are going to LOVE this app all the music you can think of you don't even have to pay I introduced this app to about 80 people they love it to  I put on a classical station and put my head phones in and I fall asleep I recommend you get this app if you are like me"
28050,"Pandora",2014-08-11,4,"well...   Let's keep in mind this took FOREVER to come out. So, the time it was being established doesn't meet the all the bugs. This is most likely the result of the foreign makes of the kindle not u understanding a word of English. This is why we have been forgotten."
28051,"Pandora",2014-12-30,4,"The only reason I didn't rate it a full five ...   The only reason I didn't rate it a full five stars, is because I have only been using Pandora for a short time and honestly have not yet had an opportunity to fully explore what it has to offer. But who can complain, IT'S FREE!!!"
28054,"Pandora",2014-03-04,5,"LOVE IT!!!   Pandora is incredible!  The Kindle App is easy to use.  In all honesty, I cannot believe how easy it is to listen to the music I love ALL the time, from big band to the Rat Pack to classic Rock.  I use a nice bluetooth speaker and it sounds like I've got the actual bands/singers in my condo!"

28071,"Pandora",2014-01-14,5,"Music to your taste   I have just started to use Pandora and like the fact that you can pick the artist, or type of music you like.  You can't  pick an individual song but that didn't matter to me.  You can give a song  a like and Pandora will find more of the same of dislike.  I can play it on my pc or my kindle fire hd."
28073,"Pandora",2016-07-04,4,"OK   It's an ok app. I like Pandora, but sometimes this app won't work on my phone. It just gets stuck loading."
28074,"Pandora",2014-10-25,3,"Not for me!   Not worth the money!  You spend too much time selecting/deselecting tunes that you either like/dislike!  Time-consuming.  The programming does not follow the music interest I select.  However, you may find it a better buy, I certainly didn't!"

28084,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"App works great.   Great app. Have not had any problems with it. Very clear sound from my kindle fire HDX. I love the landscape and portrait feature."
28085,"Pandora",2015-05-09,4,"Great app, one problem   This is a great app. The only problem is after the new update the sleep timer is hidden in the settings. Where as before you just swiped from the right to access it. The new location is kind of a pain."

28116,"Pandora",2012-10-26,5,"Pandora is Great!   I have used pandora for a long time and absolutely LOVE IT!  I can put in a band name and Pandora will pick the same Genre to play.  I find a lot of new music that I love while listening to Pandora that I normally wouldn't hear on the radio station I listen to. It also lets me read a bands biography while listening to them play so that I know more about the people in the group."
28117,"Pandora",2014-12-14,4,"Good program that seems to always be improving   I have several station on Pandora now and enjoy sharing lists with my friends.

28119,"Pandora",2015-04-07,1,"not in Canada   I did NOT either order or review Pandora!!! This thing put itself on my phone without my permission, so my review is: remove this app!!! I don't even know what it does. It has no business installing itself."

28192,"Pandora",2014-12-28,3,"ok but pet peeve   When I search for a film score of a movie it plays other movie scores that I am not interested in; in fact, it often plays other film score music first; thumbs down on a song does not exclude other songs from the same movie"
28194,"Pandora",2017-06-22,4,"Four Stars   Great!"
28204,"Pandora",2013-12-04,5,"Better than Slacker, in my opinion.   I like this so much better than the Slacker app.  It just seems like Pandora is a lot better at picking music that I like instead of Slacker.  Slacker will play some raaaaaaaandom stuff!  I like that with the ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" feature, you can fine-tune your musical tastes."

28247,"Pandora",2015-08-21,4,"Better than mix radio   Better than mix radio. It stays within the genre you choose. The ads are not that bad, similar to regular radio. The cost to upgrade is to much which i only gave 4 stars."
28256,"Pandora",2013-09-20,3,"Pandora Shortcomings   Some of the channels are limited in song selection (especially if you're into Big Band, Sinatra, etc.)---may hear the same tune several times in any one session.  I'm also against listening to Christmas songs in July, and I haven't discovered how to move it to my Christmas station without deleting it completely."
28259,"Pandora",2014-02-21,5,"I love Pandora   I like Pandora because it saves me a lot of time and the effort it takes to download music.

I feel like I have a Genius playlist that's great at mixing it up. I love also how I can customize my stations. The ads really don't bother me either so I wouldn't bother wasting my money for an ad-free experience for 3.99/mo or whatever it is."
28287,"Pandora",2013-04-22,5,"streams great   I love this app. it has every kind of music you can imagine so no one will be unhappy. The quality of music is great. It works very well on my kindle and my android phone. The only draw back are the commercials and when it asks me if I'm still listening, which I understand why it does that. But with it being free I can't really complain."

It nags if you just listen and do not give thumbs up or down on every song, I like it for listening to a lot of songs from a single artist, and the suggestions for similar artists are handy."
28314,"Pandora",2014-02-05,4,"LOVE THIS   Love that I can pick the type of music that I love.  I was disappointed though because when I put in my favorite Ricky Nelson in, it really just gave me that kind of music, but not necessarily Ricky Nelson.  I would have loved a bunch of his music.  Otherwise, I really like Pandora."

It's like a radio only you can skip the song if you don't like it but you can only skip so many times. So I suggest that you pick a station that you like. It's like Pandora on a regular computer only it's portable. Again love this app ."

28447,"Pandora",2014-11-30,4,"Sweet!   I'd say I love it but for one quirky habit it has of replaying the same songs over and over... and often the least liked of all the songs in my preferred ""alternative"" repertoire. Other than that - nifty app!"

28465,"Pandora",2014-01-11,4,"why I enjoy Pandora.   I truly enjoy the free version of Pandora. I enjoy listening to every station of music that I create, even if there's commercial. The best part is being able to listen too old song that you just don't hear on the radio. It's a great app to have on all you're electronic components."
28467,"Pandora",2016-04-26,5,"PANDORA   Get this app is so amazing free music at my hands its awesome no ads its fast and make your own stations"

28491,"Pandora",2014-04-14,5,"great app   I use this app across multiple devices. It was extremely easy to download and is very user friendly.

28508,"Pandora",2013-04-16,4,"Excellent service - music of your choice on demand   I like Pandora a great deal. The occasional talking is disturbing, however. Also, the music occasionally stops and the tablet computer shuts down. Sometimes I turn the tablet off, and Pandora keeps playing. There should be a quick overview available for these common problems. If there is one, it should be more obvious to locate."
28509,"Pandora",2016-05-19,5,"Happy!! Great song selection. kepp it up!!   So happy that I am able to have Pandora playing while I'm in other apps. Great song selection too."

28513,"Pandora",2013-08-09,4,"Good music selections, hate the commercials   Pandora is a convenient way to access music and playlists.  I have found that the music I've chosen to create the playlist have been spot on and it's as though Pandora knows exactly what music I like.  However, I don't like being forced to listen to commercials, especially the same commercials over and over."
28517,"Pandora",2015-09-08,5,"Pandora ' Awesome   I have loved Pandora since I first started using it. Great place to listen to music. I've tried others but have never been as pleased as o am with Pandora."
28518,"Pandora",2014-02-24,5,"A joy to use and listen   The interface is very easy to setup and use.Lyrics automatically displayed for the selected song.Creating favorite stations is so fun it's addictive!Only drawback is that the startup page doesn't have an option to save the users email address for login."
28520,"Pandora",2015-08-12,4,"Hater girl   Only 4 STARS because when I put pause on my music it did not pause and went to another station. I was so mad but free music that is what everyone loves yay free."

28527,"Pandora",2016-07-02,4,"Overall I love it   I really don't like the ads. There will be ads telling me about the ""ad free"" listening I'm taking part in and I'm sure I don't have to explain why this irks me. There are also ads almost every time I skip a song or switch stations. Otherwise I love this app.  I have a station for pretty much any mood I have and a variety to cover whatever else I'd enjoy hearing. Favorite part is it's free. I won't pay for the ad free, I just turn it down or tune it out."
28528,"Pandora",2017-08-17,4,"Could be better   It cuts off too much"
28534,"Pandora",2014-12-18,5,"Good quality and extensive playlists   A great streaming service.  I don't all the commercials, but I suppose I should just bite the bullet and pay for the premium subscription.  Great playlists."
28536,"Pandora",2014-04-12,5,"Pandora is perf!   I absolutely love Pandora!!! I listen to it practically all day or whenever I can. Free music and unlimited stations, what is better than that?! Great app. Absolutely perfect :3  ;)"

28546,"Pandora",2014-03-07,5,"It still great even if you don't pay   Pandora is amazing even with the fact if you skip a song you don't like it play a short ad but hey maybe those song might actually be good. The best is that is got me to try new bands I would have skip otherwise because I just never stop and listen so it great for just that."

28590,"Pandora",2014-04-27,4,"Best free music available   In my limited consideration I find Pandora to be an excellent source of pop music.  Like everyone else, commercials are becoming common in free Pandora.  Still, I have enjoyed Pandora for many years and appreciate how they figure what music suits my taste."
28592,"Pandora",2014-10-01,3,"hate   This is great for anybody who likes music which I like to listen to but it only gives you so much free time a month for you to listen to but I do not like listening to music all the time so I already took it off of my device"
28594,"Pandora",2014-01-10,3,"Great, can be better   It is a excellent relaxation experience listening to the music(classical) with random selections.What's the possibility of give listener a little more control? For instance, a particular composer? time period of the music?Anyway, I enjoy its services and it's free!"
28598,"Pandora",2014-09-01,4,"I have only been using the application for a few ...   I have only been using the application for a few days, but so far I am impressed. The ability to create a ""radio station"" based on a particular artist is very intuitive, and the lyrics and notes are a interesting addition."
28602,"Pandora",2015-11-10,5,"Great product Great listening   Pandora is so nice to use because I can take the Kindle that I use to listen from room to room.It has a great variety of music also."

28625,"Pandora",2015-12-20,5,"Always love Pandora <3   When I worked as a receptionist, I would ask whoever was waiting about their favorite musicians and create a new station for them. Now that I have a kid, I use it to play lullabies most nights.  It is wonderful to have constant random music that I love pop up rather than having to constantly cycle through my cds or deal with radio replays. There aren't too many commercials, and lately, the free hour of music ads have been really appreciated."

28986,"Pandora",2012-12-30,5,"Best Internet Radio   In my opinion this product beats all. I like the fact that I can select a band that I like, to create a station. Once it is started only bands that are in a similar genre are played. To be fair, the only other one I have tried was Slacker, and that was before I found Pandora. Once I found it I didn't need to look anywhere else."

The music is from years gone by (and from movies I've watched [i.e. Dirty Dancing to name one of them]).  The other day I was listening to my music and heard a song that I used to love, but haven't heard for years.  It is music that makes you want to dance or just move to the music."
29664,"Pandora",2014-01-02,4,"Great way to listen to whatever you want   Pandora is a fabulous way to listen to whatever type of music suits your mood for the moment.  Much variety. 4 stars because it will ask often enough if you are still listening and you need to answer it or the music stops playing- that gets old."
29666,"Pandora",2014-09-16,1,"... or music apps for my kindle that work just fine, but this one doesn't work if I'm not ...   I have downloades other radio or music apps for my kindle that work just fine, but this one doesn't work if I'm not in the US, I live in Mexico and it's not available for my country...it sucks!!!"
29675,"Pandora",2014-11-03,5,"Great Music for Free!!!   I listen to Pandora everyday. I love it. The only complaint of course is the advertisements. But u can pay a fee each month and that is suppose to stop them.  Other than that I love it."
29676,"Pandora",2012-12-01,5,"Finally got it to load   I was not successful in getting it to download onto my kindle fire hd at first, although I was able to get it onto my smart phone and computer.  Initially, I wasn't able to find out why it wouldn't load, so I thought I would be unable to give it a good rating.  But now it is loaded, and I am perfectly delighted."
29678,"Pandora",2014-11-15,5,"Love it!!   Listen to my favorite artists and music everyday. It's quick nd easy and lots of fun. Love it"

I use it at home, at work, and now it's on my Kindle Fire HD so I can take it with me.

29711,"Pandora",2015-02-23,4,"Pandora Lives On...   Pandora searches not only for that particular artist/ music you seek, finding this and similar.  Often the reward is music new to you and or some you've forgotten."

29867,"Pandora",2013-04-19,5,"Awesome   Easy to use and plenty of awesome music.  I have the basic package which means there is an occasional commercial break.  I really don't mind at all.  They must have ordered the sponsors to stop producing annoying commercials."

29914,"Pandora",2014-02-08,5,"Great service, wonderful music, thanks.   On my Laptop I loved when my favorite music would come on immediately,and I loved the thumbs UP and DOWN feature which was always recognized so that I could hear my favorites more often.

29939,"Pandora",2014-07-30,5,"No Complaints   Nearly tailor-made play lists and few interruptions. The satellite options (Sirius/XM) aren't cost effective for many people. Pandora makes it possible to hear what you like, when and where you like."

29969,"Pandora",2013-01-10,5,"Free Version   I use the free version of Pandora. Sounds great on my Samsung Galaxy player 4.2. The on screen ads don't bother me because my player turns the screen off after a few minutes so I never see them. As for the voice ads not that many in between songs. Good selection of songs in the different categories."
29971,"Pandora",2016-01-25,4,"Four Stars   Great song selections and availability but find some of the advertisements offensive."

30164,"Pandora",2014-04-25,1,"Pandora One upgrade? More like Pandora NONE!   Almost immediately after i upgraded to ad-free pandora one, i started getting error messages. (never received an error message before upgrading)it got continuously worse, sometimes shutting down the app completely, other times leaving me sitting listening to silence which eventually turned into nothing.I tried to reach them -they have NO PHONE NUMBER-i emailed them, per their instructions as being the only way to communicate with them.I expressed my dissatisfaction in the product that they were now charging me for, especially in light of the flawless experience I had enjoyed as a non-paying customer.  I stated that I had uninstalled the app from my phone already, but that i hadn't cancelled the service yet, because before i severed ties completely i wanted them to refund me every penny they had taken for a product they'd never delivered. Granted it was only 4 or 5 dollars at that point, but i don't have extra dollars to throw into the wind and they didn't deserve that money@all.Long story short - i am busy and before too long, some other nightmare in my life took center stage, and I only realized that Pandora had NEVER EVEN REPLIED to my email, until..... you guessed it! i noticed the charge on my credit card again the other day!aarrgghhh!!!!!!so, thanks alot Pandora for your upgraded product, PANDORA NONE!p.s. get a freaking phone number with the money you charged me without delivering a product."

30232,"Pandora",2014-01-17,5,"I have found so much great music   I love being able to set stations.  I work out with my workout station, play calming music when I work, and sing along with my favorite songs on my sing along station.  It's easy to use.  Just wish I could double star my favorites."
30236,"Pandora",2014-01-06,5,"Pandora   I love Pandora on my Kindle.  It is convenient and easily accessible.  I is free, and I can take it anywhere.  I will be flying and know that I will be spending lots of time in airports, so it's nice to know I have Pandora available."

30243,"Pandora",2016-10-08,5,"Five Stars   Awesome music selection"
30245,"Pandora",2017-03-11,4,"Good, could be great   Actually pay for the subscription, so I must be a fan. A few minor problems - they apparently make no attempt to ""normalize"" the levels, leading to significant changes from track to track. And too often, especially with live tracks, the heads and tails are just abruptly clipped, which can be jarring. Also, while they do seem to take 'thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" seriously, the play lists are narrow; listening for a full day will often produce a lot of replays, with too few ""deep tracks"", just the same old popular cuts.But reliability has been good, and sound quality perfectly satisfactory, other that what was mentioned above"
30246,"Pandora",2016-08-20,5,"Five Stars   Love the way I can play the music."
30248,"Pandora",2016-05-11,5,"Five Stars   Can't get enough of Pandora.  I play it everywhere I can!"
30249,"Pandora",2014-09-20,4,"Very interesting experiment.   Hard to argue the quality of what this site offers for free.  It does seem to progressively stray away from the channel you set up, but I guess that's kind of part of what it's about."

30266,"Pandora",2015-02-21,5,"Awesome   Pandora is so fun to use but it sucks that it needs WiFi to actually listen to it. The people who made Pandora need 2 fix that little itsy bitsy problem."
30267,"Pandora",2014-12-26,3,"If you hate ads then buy the ad-free version.   Spend the extra 3 dollars so you don't have to keep getting the annoying advertisement pop-ups. That is the only reason that I have for the less than great rating."

30288,"Pandora",2016-03-26,5,"Pandora Needs Better Customer Service/Customer Support...Music Selections Are Fantastic   I love the stations and feeds on Pandora but if your bank changes your debit or credit card number...you are in for many phone calls to Amazon and emails to Pandora...you can not contact Pandora directly by phone. Getting my billing straight, as I am a Pandora One subscriber, took about three weeks. They have also reformatted how you view info about the artists and the music several times. They should have left alone;/if it's not broke don't fix it. Sometimes I can't connect wirelessly when away from home and on a free Wi-Fi and that is annoying and disappointing."
30291,"Pandora",2014-03-04,4,"Great way to discover new songs and artists   Through Pandora, I've discovered new artists and been reminded of old classics I wouldn't hear anywhere else. Sure, I wish the free version didn't have ads, but I understand they have to make a living like the rest of us."

30322,"Pandora",2014-05-14,5,"Can't live without it.   I often try to remember what life was like without Pandora. Then i remember i just surfed radio stations constantly to find a song I want to listen to. Pandora is much more convenient and never has static :)"

30390,"Pandora",2013-12-31,5,"LOVE!   Pandora is great! I TRULEY RECOMMEND You can listen to music of your choice, for free, it precautions you when a song is explicit that is about to be played... so if you have a child listening that maybe shouldn't hear something... but you can change that under settings. You can turn on the sleep timer for however long and you can fall a sleep to the music... and it will even stop in the middle of a song too. You can send a specific station or track to a friend on Facebook and a couple other ways... which is great. When you find a specific station and you click the like buttons (thumbs) or dislike buttons, it will sort the music based upon what it thinks you will like... which is great because you may not know exactly which song you wish to listen to... so it selects one for you, also it's great because if it is a classical station you might love a specific song so, you make a station for it then you can listen to itIn... say d flat major"

30437,"Pandora",2014-04-14,4,"Suprisingly Amazing   Pandora gives you control of your music. By simply liking, disliking or skipping songs played on your radio station, Pandora deciders the type of music you're looking for.It has a sleep timer from 15 min. up to an hour, which is great when you like falling to sleep with music without wearing down the battery on your device.I've found that there are fewer and shorter ads on the mobile app than the website online.One place for improvement; simplify the ability to use the alarm clock feature. I can't seem to get it to turn on without having to unlock the kindle first, which defeats the purpose of an alarm clock if you have to be awake for it to go off...Everything else is fantastic."

30456,"Pandora",2013-09-21,4,"Easy to use.   I was surprised at how easy it is to use; though I dislike these reviews due to need for too many words. I will continue to explore the benefits and offerings.  I was slightly disappointed that a few of my favorite artists/songs were not available."

30962,"Pandora",2014-01-02,5,"My husband LOVES this app   I haven't really used this app yet, but my husband absolutely LOVES it.  You can pick your artists that you like and then it will recommend music from what you've liked.  You can make your own ""radio stations"" and you can download the whole album, not just certain songs.  It also puts them into categories, which I like (country, alternative, etc.)  For example, in his country, he has the ""Lee Brice"" station, his rap the ""Eminem"" station, etc.  And then your music will play in the background while you do whatever else you want on your tablet - check e-mails, facebook, play games, etc."

31027,"Pandora",2016-09-29,5,"Great app for a music afficionado.   Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to different kinds of music that harmonise with one's nerve strings. It's a good starting place to get basic info about the composer and musician(s). Some of the choices will even inspire to shell out the cash for a more permanent option.The free version is financed by ads, but they are not too oppressive, and, after all, this is primarily a music outlet. However, when the audio ads come on, pressing the Mute button for a 5-count of ""Mississippi One..."" takes care of that."

31333,"Pandora",2016-09-11,4,"Recommend   Love Pandora.... It is great to get the monthly membership so you can play songs for four hours uninterrupted.  Only drawback to Pandora, is sometimes they get kinda wild and toss in songs that are NOT compatible with the list you have made... Like Bee Gees in with Van Morrison.  But that is only sometimes, and normally it runs smoothly!!!"

31451,"Pandora",2014-03-27,4,"pandora   Really like Pandora radio. I PAY the yearly fee for pandora one, commercial free version. It has a better sound and no limit on how much you can listen. Worth every penny. I'm very satisfied."
31454,"Pandora",2014-01-03,5,"It's Pandora...   I've been using Pandora practically since it first started. I remember the carefree days before the advent of advertising on it. Advertising is annoying, but life is business and if you cannot turn a profit you cannot stay alive.While you do tend to have to turn down as many or more songs you don't like as you find songs you DO like... You lose the ones you dislike very quickly, and you can keep track of the ones you do practically forever, it still works out in your favor most of the time."
31461,"Pandora",2016-02-27,5,"First and (still) the Best   I love Pandora and I'm fiercely loyal to the service. Actually offered to make a donation when I first discovered it a couple years ago - they thanked me and suggested I subscribe (didn't know about they offered a subscription service). The staff went without pay for a time early on until Pandora received their first round of venture funding. Best part about Pandora is the opportunity to discover new talent (some don't even have bios yet) or established artists you've never listed to. Maybe Pandora's competitors offer something like this - don't know, don't care. It's Pandora for me."
31464,"Pandora",2015-05-18,4,"This app is good   This app is pretty good but it sometimes kicks me out of the app. Also it let's you listen to the latest music"

31508,"Pandora",2016-08-13,5,"Love music   Love music"
31514,"Pandora",2016-02-23,5,"Variety is Great   I have been using Pandora for years now.  I listen to it at work and home.  One word of caution - even though it may say ""music for work"" be aware that it does not filter out all songs that have profanity.  It may be considered mild but it depends on your setting.  I would not use ""music for work"" if it was an educational setting even in an office.  But that's just my opinion- I was so surprised to hear curse words on that station and quickly turned the volume down.  Pandora offers plenty of options that everyone can find something that makes them happy to listen to."
31515,"Pandora",2014-04-10,1,"To many commercials.   Unless you pay a small amount each month to remove commercials, you will be stuck with a lot of advertisements!"
31517,"Pandora",2014-02-20,5,"Love Pandora   it is so nice to o be able to listen to they types of songs I choose to listen to vs. having to have the total mix for everyone's listening pleasures. I have the app on my iPhone, Kindle and iPad."

31533,"Pandora",2016-03-03,4,"Annoying but, worth listening to if you want specific music played.   I really find listening to specific musics enjoyable.  the commercials aren't that bad except they replay the same 5 over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over AND OVER AGAIN>... every 15 minutes I think... that alone has steered me away.  I now listen to iHeart Radio... they play the same commercials but, only ON EVERY HOUR....  still annoying but, not as often......"
31552,"Pandora",2016-01-28,1,"One Star   Once i put on a song I can never turn it off!!Yuck!!!"

31556,"Pandora",2014-04-10,5,"Pandora   Very nice indeed. Love it. Adore it. Entertaining. Calming. What a program.  Strongly recommend it for relaxation or for parties, for when one is doing crafts or for whatever occasion..."
31559,"Pandora",2016-07-26,5,"Five Stars   Love this app"
31562,"Pandora",2013-10-06,4,"Great app   If you are fine with a little randomness, this is perfect for you.  I have found new songs and new artists I like now due to this app.  However, there are a few problems:40 hour limit: for mobile devices, you get 40 hours of music per week.  That's a little over 5 hours per day, which is good if you don't listen to as much as I do (I'm almost constantly listening to music)Ads: not too bad, the limit is what gets me.  What annoys me a little, however is that I think the ads are included in your limit.Sure, they give a couple good solutions.  The first option is to pay a dollar for unlimited music, but that's just for a month.  Second is Pandora One, which is the dollars a month if I remember right.  If you have access to a computer, that's the best option in my opinion.  However, getting it on mobile is also nice for when a computer isn't on and ready."
31563,"Pandora",2016-08-08,5,"Heartfelt   Wonderful."
31564,"Pandora",2014-03-03,5,"Love Radio then Pandors   This is such a great app.  Especially since it is built into my new car radio system.  Just plug the cell phone into the USB port and connect yo Pandora.  Love this app and if course the music."

31571,"Pandora",2014-07-28,5,"Music   I like Pandora very much.  There are so many choices in music.  My favorite is classical.  Just type in an artist for the songs.  Great for listening while you read."
31575,"Pandora",2015-12-03,5,"Five Stars   Gotta love somebody who lets you program your own radio station ."
31576,"Pandora",2013-05-26,4,"nice to listen to!   I love pandora, and personally, the ads don't bother me (I  mean, I'm not going to pay to get rid of them, so it works for me). I really love that I can have my kindle charging and have pandora play while my kindle is turned off (not powered off, just the screen) and it'll still charge and play the music!The only problem I have with this app (and why it's not five stars) is that sometimes when I closed the app, it'll start up the app again (causing it to switch out what I'm doing to pandora). I found that I couldn't just leave the app, I had to actually hit the menu button (on the upper right corner) to quit so that it would stay closed.Other than that, I found no faults and would definitely recommend this free app to anyone!"

Inspector is becoming like my friend after reading the third in series.  I have learned a great deal about the Canadian countryside, the people,  their delicious foods, their habits and their individual characters.  I love the Chief Inspector's homicide team and their loyalty to Inspector Gamache.  Each book has featured a victim murdered in a totally different way under mysterious circumstances. It is fun to see how the inspector finds his ""man"". I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.  I think it is best to read the books in order.."

32493,"Pandora",2016-05-28,5,"Love constant music.   Great app!"
32499,"Pandora",2015-09-07,5,"Five Stars   Love pandora!"
32502,"Pandora",2013-09-15,5,"Great source for free music   Pros:I love Pandora because it is pretty much like a radio and an MP3 Player combined in the sense that,you can choose your favorite songs,singers,rappers,or bands and the radio will give you their stations along with similar music related to what you chose.For example,if you type into the search engine,Brittney Spears,then her songs will show up with the new Britney Spears station you created and they will also add some songs from a similar artist like Cristina Aguilera,etc.I like this because you can learn new songs from many different artists.Pandora is really great at blending similar song styles.You can share the song or station you are listening to on facebook or twitter also.You are also allowed to skip a song you don't like by either pressing the skip icon or the dislike icon.The songs also comes with biography info about the artist/artists and the lyrics to each song as well as the album name.FREE.Cons:Since Pandora is free and they pay for licenses to the songs,you are only allowed five or six skips a day.Afterwards,you can either stick it out or just change the station to something else.Pandora seems to only have certain songs from different artists not ALL their songs so even if you were to type in ""Count on Me"" by Bruno Mars for example into the search engine,it may just give you a different Bruno Mars song or a song like the one you requested but by a different artist altogether.Also,you cannot REWIND,FAST FORWARD,or REPLAY a song at all and I think that goes back to the fact that they have to pay for it.And,if you type in a song you just recently listened to and try to hear it again,for some reason it doesn't let you.Summary: Pandora is a free radio station app where you can find your favorite songs and artists simply by typing their names into a search engine.You can always edit,meaning you can delete or add stations and it is a great way to learn new songs.While the skips are limited to five or six a day,each song provides you with lyrics and background information on the artist.You can always share what you are listening to on Facebook,Twitter,etc to let friends and family know but just remember you cannot replay a song so wait a bit to try to find it in the search engine.If you hit the like icon on a song,that particular song is more likely to show back up quicker so you wont have to wait long for it but just remember that you cannot rewind or fast forward,you can only PAUSE.Pandora is completely Iphone compatible and even pauses itself when you get an incoming phone call so you can always go back and resume a song when you are done talking.On the Kindle Fire,Pandora shows up nice and big on the screen which will help you to read the lyrics better!In all,Pandora is a amazing app to get for any device that is capable of having it and is the best music app created!!"
32503,"Pandora",2014-11-23,5,"love it!!   enjoy the music. easy to start stations. the price is free. ads are very few and not distracting. well worth getting the app."
32504,"Pandora",2016-02-03,5,"Enjoy!   Use it on wireless devices.  Enjoy!"

32509,"Pandora",2014-01-08,4,"Great!   It's fun to be able to download music and then play it through my Kindle.  However, if you are on an airplane, make sure you have earphones so you don't bother your neighbor passengers."
32511,"Pandora",2016-01-29,1,"One Star   not good instructions to get started"
32512,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"Fantastic!   This is now my go-to place for listening to music, which is one of my favorite things to do. What a great way to go directly to the songs I love.  Fast and easy to set up and use."
32513,"Pandora",2014-05-19,4,"a great way to listen to music   I have loved Pandora in the past and the app is almost as good.  The only thing I would change is that you can't like songs other than the one currently playing."

32709,"Pandora",2013-03-14,4,"Open Sesame! Make me an old time DJ   Pandora works nicely on my new Kindle Fire. So why the 4 stars vs. a 5? Because, I am not sure it really deserves more than 4! In a week, I may find it very deficient in some unknown area, or in 6 months I may not be able to recall a time when I could get through the day without Pandora simulating my tastes in musics of all genres. The basic option cost me nothing, so maybe my lack of skin in the game tempers my enthusiasm or disdain. If it costs you nothing to try Pandora, I recommend that you get it and make your own assessment."
32713,"Pandora",2013-12-15,5,"Wonderful place for MY music!   I love easy access to MY music, and that is just what Pandora provides.  I can set up as many ""channels"" as I want to play the different genres of music that are important to me!"

32784,"Pandora",2014-02-25,5,"Pandora   I enjoy listening to music and Pandora allows me to create stations according to my musical taste. I also listen to Pandora on my cell phone and Sonos. I recommend Pandora."
32785,"Pandora",2013-07-18,2,"Typical of most Amazon Apps   I practice meditation and deeply love classic and SOME ""New Age"" music.  I was given a Kindle Fire HD for a gift, and overall, I like it.  The Kindle, that is.  However, the person who said it is an instrument set up for Amazon's benefit and NOT the customers...had it right.  Pandora is an excellent example of how Amazon bilks its customers:  the App is advertised as ""free"", which causes the customer to download it, only to discover that to get any real pleasure out of it, there is a fee to be paid.  Pandora is advertised as free:  download it, tell it what you like, and you will get the music you want FOR FREE.  Not so, of course:  if you want the music for free, you must put up with horrible advertisements.  If I liked rock-n-roll, it wouldn't be so bad, but right after an exquisite, soft, relaxing piece of music, I have to listen to a lengthy commercial for Allstate, or house paint or...whatever.  Ads pop up all over the place.  You can't see the album covers for ads.  Oh, but wait:  just pay the price, and the ads will go away!  The price, by the way--at this point--isn't that bad.  What I resent is that (1) the ""station"" created by Pandora for my liking doesn't play what I want, it plays what IT wants; and (2) I wasn't told ahead of time that if I wanted to actually be able to enjoy the App, I had to pay.  I have found this to be true of nearly everything I have tried on my Kindle.  The only thing it is truly good for is reading, and even then, the books are often poorly formatted, loaded with editing mistakes and misspelled words.  The Apps are loaded with ads and invariably end up costing money the customer isn't warned about ahead of time.  As for Pandora, it is very disappointing...I will continue to look for an applications that is put together with some sense of ethical idealism, one that doesn't break my eardrums with commercials and lurid pop-up ads."
32786,"Pandora",2014-02-14,5,"GREAT.   This is a great program. My husband is learning  how to work it,  and many things on it and how to work it. He says it is the best thing I ever gave him.(JUST KIDDING)......."

33382,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Pandora ""Box"" is great   I have Pandora installed on my older model computer and had trouble with smooth streaming.  With the Kindle Fire, the songs stream smoothly. If you're not familiar with Pandora, it is a program that allows you to choose the type of music you want to hear.  I started with a favorite musician and put that name in my ""Station"".  After that song ended, Pandora played a song from another artist of that genre.  If I gave the song a thumbs up, the song continued and more of the new artist's songs would eventually be played on my ""station.""  If I gave it a thumbs down, the song immediately stopped playing and Pandora went on to another artist and another song. I now have several ""stations"" -- one for relaxation music, one for blues, one for classical, one for country, etc.  Pandora works great with Kindle Fire... Of course, the sound system isn't a Bose, so if your a musical purist, you shouldn't expect great surround sound.I really don't see how anyone can go wrong with downloading and using Pandora."

I like music to be playing when I'm working,and Pandora is not the easiest to get going quick, but they also play songs by the artists I select that I don't even have in my extensive collection. I like the fact that you can select artists and they create a whole station around them and artists that are similar. Their picks for extra artists are generally very good--many artists I like are already included with others I've chosen. The few short commercials are hardly a bother, and they play long cuts uninterrupted."

34270,"Pandora",2015-10-21,5,"Five Stars   very pleased with this product"
34273,"Pandora",2013-12-29,3,"Good, but I don't use it much   This app sounds great, but I don't really use it much since I have the Sirius/XM app installed.  I would use it more if I didn't have a pay service, but there are a couple of things I am not crazy about:  1) Ads, but nothing you can do about that; and 2) when I select an artist to start with, it seems they don't play very much from that artist, and the number of other artists they play is very limited.  For example, I ask for a station to begin with Rush, and I'll hear a Rush song to start with, but not again for 30-45 minutes.  In the meantime, I'll hear a couple of songs from Led Zeppelin, a couple from the Rolling Stones, and maybe 2 or 3 more artists, and no others.  So maybe this app is not for me."

35107,"Pandora",2012-11-15,4,"(Update) Looking for Exit...   Seriously Pandora, where did the Exit or Quit button go for the app on the Kindle Fire HD?  The only way to stop is to go into the app settings and forceclose it... But then it might ""Misbehave""  haha..  It's already misbehaving!!  While you are fixing that glitch, you might want to consider a sleep timer. That would be a wonderful addition to your app...adding one extra star, the menu button is now fixed on the Kindle Fire, now we can ""quit"" instead of forceclosing, thank you.A sleep timer will complete the app and make it 5 star!I am not sure about the problems others are having, songs not completing, ads, etc. All my stations play perfectly, always have. as far as ads, I am usually doing something besides staring at the album art so I rarely notice the ads, sometimes there is a break for an audible ad, but no big deal.If the ads bother you, it's easy to fix, just get the paid app.After several hours of using the app it will pause and ask if you are still listening. All you got to say is yes or no... if you aren't it will stay paused. no big deal and I appreciate that."

But Pandora does not hammer you with so much in the way of intrusive advertising. The algorithm sometimes makes what seem like odd choices of related music and artists, but in the end I'm very impressed with how well it does. If you take the time to actually thumbs-up and tumbs-down tunes you like and don't like (respectively), over time you will build stations that suit your taste exactly. And one of the nicest features is discovering tunes and musicians you love that you probably never would have discovered otherwise. I'm an Android user, and the app works seamlessly on my phone."

This rating is for the application only.  I suspect those wanting to get this application already know about Pandora, they don't need me to rate the website.My wife enjoys this application more than I do since she's the one with the Pandora account.  She's able to listen to her Pandora music even while she uses her Kindle to read a book.  I would have been happy if this app had to open with no other app running, providing it worked.  But this app goes beyond and has earned the 5 star rating hands down.  My wife is VERY happy with this app.Works well on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9."

37753,"Pandora",2016-02-08,3,"Meh.   Good music player... for things not on the local device.  Everything is streamed.  For some, this is awesome.  For others with already extensive collections, it is redundant at best.Then, there's the randomness.  You start with some single song or artist, or maybe even a vague genre as a base and it randomly tries to figure out what (based on music DNA) you might like related to that baseline.  And trying to teach it some of the most-simple things like ""I hate this artist, in total"", just seem to be beyond the comprehension of the app.Not horrible.  But plenty of room for improvement."
37755,"Pandora",2014-02-27,5,"Pandora is a good app for playing music you like.   You can choose what music to play, and the ads are really not that annoying. What a good app to have!"

39135,"Pandora",2014-02-02,5,"No Regrets Downloading   I honestly just accessed the app store just to write this review. If I could have one downloaded app on my kindle, this would be it. Ever since downloading this, I've even been using it on my laptop.Pandora basically tells you to tell it what artists you love and plays their songs as well as other similar artists and songs. I've locked in Usher and it's been playing slow Chris Brown and J. Holiday and basically anything that sounds like Usher. It's super easy to use and you even have the choice to give thumbs down to songs you don't like (it'll skip it but you only have a limited amount per hour or so.)I recommend this for ANY music lover, you won't regret it & it's free."
39143,"Pandora",2013-01-08,4,"Pretty Cool   I like Pandora.  You can listen to music of your favorite artists.  This is all new to me, so it is fun exploring.Yes I would recommend."

39248,"Pandora",2014-12-23,5,"Five Stars   Fantastic music selections."
39249,"Pandora",2014-07-26,3,"How wonderful life is with Pandora in the world   I think that Pandora is a great app to have, especially because its free, but also because it allows you to listen to relativley any sort of music. It is a very pleasurable thing to have on your phone, and I very much enjoy it. A few downsides would be that unless you upgrade it, you have constant commercials and advertizments  which sometimes block your ability to view the album cover and/ or the song lyrics. Also, you often get a mix of artists on your station, even if you specify a particular artist. So, you may have, for example, a Lady Gaga station but instead of Lady Gaga it constantley plays Ke$ha and Rhiana and Miley Cyrus, which is perfectley fine. It just may take a while to find a Lady Gaga song and it doesnt allow you to press skip very often because you have a dailey skip limit, which virtually most radio apps have, anyway. I enjoy it none the less, and I hope that you will, too!:)"

IHeart Radio works fine so it's not my phone or the gym's Wi-Fi. Recently, Pandora stopped working altogether on my phone, whether I was connected to my home Wi-Fi, the gym's, or no Wi-Fi at all (making me use data). I would turn on the app, and my phone screen would go black. Had to turn the phone off and back on again to get my home screen. So I uninstalled Pandora, and then reinstalled it. Now it is working; let's see for how long."

If I could change one little thing it is to automatically remove Holiday music from my station after the holiday is over. Otherwise it continues to play and I have to thumb it down and add it back manually later. I think it is really easy to use. Some songs will even have lyrics available which is nice if I feel the need to sing along and don't know it well."

41079,"Pandora",2015-11-23,3,"Not bad but I prefer Spotify   Not bad but I prefer Spotify. The main issue with Pandora is that if you are trying to listen to music of a certain genre, it keeps playing old stuff, like 5-6 and more years old stuff. If you just want music like a certain artist you might be luckier."

41114,"Pandora",2014-05-18,2,"it's always running   I like Pandora.  When I paid for a subscription I listened to my favorite styles of music on my android tablet, my Kindle Fire and my pc.  When I switched to the free account, I could still listen on everything but my Kindle Fire.  This app keeps telling me I've ""timed out"", even though I haven't listened to it for days.  The last straw came when my KF notified me that Pandora had automatically been updated.  I clicked on the app and was told I was timed out of a version I haven't even used!  Some apps never stop running.  This seems to be one of them.  I thought it might help if I logged out instead of telling it to quit, but I couldn't get in to do that.  If you want to pay for a subscription, you won't have this problem.  But at least for now I'm through with this app that counts itself as running when it isn't being used."

Great for a free app. I wish there were more ways to extrapolate lesser known artists as opposed to only the obviously famous ones. I feel like I spend more time fast forwarding through songs (which you're only allowed to do so many times before a commercial break) than I am listening to actual music. I also have a problem with how some of the genres populate their songs, artists, etc. I disagree with how a lot of the music winds up getting categorized."

41982,"Pandora",2016-02-11,1,"STUPID   When I try to play a song it only plays like 0.001% of a second of it then it skips to the end and freezes.

41990,"Pandora",2012-11-20,5,"Pandora App   I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire. I can now listen to whatever music I am in the mood for when I am on my Kindle. Even better, it was a free app! Very easy to download, just took seconds."
41992,"Pandora",2012-12-09,4,"Awesome   I listen to all the time and its like having your very own DJ.  I am very pleased with it!"
42003,"Pandora",2013-12-26,5,"Love it!   I heard Pandora playing at someone's house several weeks ago. I decided to sign up for the free version to see what it was like. They do have ads however they are few and far between. There is no comparison to regular radio which bombard you with so many commercials it seems that there are more of them than there is music. With Pandora you can also choose your favorite genres. Most radio stations have a theme but Pandora is much better I think. I will never listen to radio again if Pandora is available."
42009,"Pandora",2012-11-28,5,"Love pandora   I use it all the time for every music mood. Plus i can listen to all sorts of comedy too"
42013,"Pandora",2012-02-14,3,"Needs Improvement   It seems the phone app seems to drop songs quite often, not sure if this a Pandora issue or phone, otherwise it's alright."
42016,"Pandora",2013-01-10,5,"excellent   I love the fact you can make your own station. It plays the songs you like. It goes with you."
42019,"Pandora",2015-02-06,5,"FREE And Less Commercials Than Radio; Streaming Doesn't Count Towards Data Usage On T-Mobile   I got this app for my Kindle and Android phone and now I have music everywhere I go. It's much better than radio. ""Reception"" is crystal clear and it has less (a lot less!) commercials than radio. Commercial interruptions are tolerable and the content of the commercials are even relevant sometimes. And if you're willing pay a monthly subscription fee (currently 4.99, up from 3.00 when it was introduced in 2009), you get  advertising-free music. Last, I shouldn't forget to mention that if you have T-Mobile (I do), music streaming on Pandora doesn't count towards your data usage. SWEEEET!"
42026,"Pandora",2011-10-24,5,"Very nice.   I can't stop using this app. Very enjoyable. No problems so far. Who doesn't like having music of their choice anytime, anywhere?"
42029,"Pandora",2017-02-02,1,"annoying   it keeps coming on when I'm doing something else on another menu. I can't get rid of it unless I completely close down my device."
42036,"Pandora",2015-02-16,4,"self-explanatory Pandora app   It's free! With adverts. And you have to create a Pandora account or sign in with an existing one. :P And you can only use it while connected to the internet, which makes sense, but is a bit of a bummer. No airplane mode with this one! It took me a little time to figure out how to navigate, but it's fairly simple, so I think I've got the basics down. The best part is that you can run this in the background while you do other things on your Kindle; I like to listen as I read, especially since I haven't gotten my own music onto my Fire yet. I think it's best suited for people already familiar with Pandora, but I recommend it for anyone who's online and wants some music!"
42038,"Pandora",2012-05-08,4,"love it   Ok so I discovered Pandora and fell in love with it. I like that I can change and create my own stations."
42047,"Pandora",2016-09-25,1,"My account shows that I have this app, but ...   My account shows that I have this app, but I don't - Every time I click on it, it says my 'session has timed out' (although I just tried opening it) and other times it says that 'an account cannot be set up for me at this time' (or words to that effect)."
42051,"Pandora",2016-05-16,4,"what was the point???   I love the app but one problem: the comment section.  People keep leaving chain mail for example, say this kiss your hand  post this on other songs in minutes and you will have good luck and people are swearing and giving out personal information.  And I keep saying, "" do not give out personal information like that you never know what will happen."". And people are just being inappropriate.  So, either take down the comment section or make sure to be super strict like on Moviestar Planet."
42052,"Pandora",2015-02-20,1,"Dont like their official app   Too many ads"
42053,"Pandora",2013-09-06,5,"Free music   I use al the time instead of playing my radio at home and in the car. This app is a must have."
42055,"Pandora",2016-09-04,5,"Great   Love this! However, too many and too long pauses. Guess I'm having trouble with streaming. I'm not tech savvy, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem is or what to do to remedy it."
42057,"Pandora",2013-12-30,5,"Music I like at my fingertips   My neighbor helped me sign-up on Pandora.  We were able to listen to great, instrumental Christmas music.  Now I can listen to many different varieties of music that my wife and I enjoy.  Mostly easy-listening.  I have a wireless speaker that I can take to any room I want and the music is right there.  What a treat.  No more crap radio."
42058,"Pandora",2015-06-24,5,"awesome but ......... adds   I give this a 5 star rating because I am really stuck to music, and it is free!!! I can create new stations. But the big deal is adds. Every song I play, I leave my fire on my bed and listen to an add, and another one comes on. UUUUURRRRRGGGGG!!!!! So I almost put a 4 star rating.😞😠. But my 💜 (heart) told me not to. So I didn't. I told my mom last night I wish that there were NO adds in the world. But I have really great station's like Dove Camron or Ariana Grande."
42061,"Pandora",2016-07-18,5,"Love Pandora!   I have been using Pandora for years now and I absolutely adore the service! I must have 15 custom-created stations on it . Not only do i enjoy music I know but it also gives me the opportunity to hear new music and artists I have never heard before."
42062,"Pandora",2016-04-06,1,"Tired of it taking over my camera....   This app would place the picture of the letter p in my photo gallery in several different spots and I would remove them and it would do it again so I removed it from my phone."
42064,"Pandora",2016-10-04,4,"Good music app   Good music app. You are able to create a profile and start listening right away without having to download each song. You are able to pick an artist or genre and it gives you a variety of music. You can pick anything from smooth jazz to lil wayne. There a few short ads that pop up in between songs. You are able to skip I think 5 or 6 at a time if you don't want to hear it at the moment. This app learns your tastes and will suggest songs or remove ones you didn't like from your playlist. I like that you can even listen to comedy skits or holiday music. If you are looking for a good music app this is it."
42067,"Pandora",2015-08-02,3,"I loved how there was a programming bug at one point ...   Pandora app works as intended, however having a video add literally every 2-3 songs is a bit excessive. I loved how there was a programming bug at one point of time that caused AD interruptions, however seems like that has been since fixed. The only other thing I can think of is how it recommends like artists for your playlist. Very redundant on songs, little variety. Some recommendations are complete outside the genre that you are listening to. Songs that I have downvoted still play, it is a very broken system. If Grooveshark wouldn't have been shut down, I would definitely not be using Pandora. Needs improvement for sure."
42068,"Pandora",2014-05-08,1,"Excited, and then...   I was reading the reviews while Pandora got downloaded on my kindle, then I open it, and...  It didn't work on Peru. Yes, I am in Peru and I talk English pretty well, and I am American. Yeah, confusing. But the point is that it doesn't work everywhere. It just works in the US.Bam, they got me. I usually give good reviews, but I couldn't even use it, so, what's the point?Thanks, and put useful to this review, please.Oh, I think you'd like hotspot fm. Look for I, it's free.Thanks"
42070,"Pandora",2016-11-14,5,"Love Pandora   I love this app, and will continue to use it even with the other apps out there. Pandora will forever be my favorite one. I wish it was free from ads, but I guess that is why you have the option to buy it without ads"
42072,"Pandora",2015-07-30,5,"Pandora created a day spa station for me!   Pandora makes it super easy to assemble music of the same genre. I have created a lot of radio stations, but when I made a station from one particularly relaxing track (by David and Steve Gordon), Pandora found more music like it than I ever expected to find. I love discovering new titles and learning about the artists. This station is like being at a spa every time I hear the selection of music that Pandora plays. I hope Pandora will always be around."
42074,"Pandora",2016-02-04,5,"SMOOTH JAZZ   I love Pandora!!! It gives me the choice of what I want to listen to without pushing buttons to find that one station.If I want to change it, it can be done just for me.My preference is SMOOTH JAZZ it gives peace of mind and I can meditate, relax, after work or cleaning house on a Saturday morning.Even when I have a bad day SMOOTH JAZZ is the way to go. Variety with PANDORA is the way to go......A+++++++"
42077,"Pandora",2013-01-18,5,"Pandora   It is a great way to hear your favorite music when using your Kindle for another app. I also like the fact I can listen wherever I can use my Kindle."
42079,"Pandora",2014-05-09,5,"Pandora is the best music program we have ever experienced.   My wife and I chose this app. after we purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The variety of music with Pandora isthe best we have ever heard. Many of the album cuts by the artists you choose and others are cuts wehave never heard and it's always a pleasure to hear a song by a favorite artist for the first time.Their may be other apps out there that are similar to Pandora and maybe better but my wife and I aren't looking.We are permanent Pandora listeners. It also works well with our TV's through Roku and Smart TV's.We highly recommend Pandora for all music lovers and the variety it brings to your life."
42084,"Pandora",2016-01-29,1,"My pandora wouldn't upload correctly so when I deleted it ...   My pandora wouldn't upload correctly so when I deleted it to try and reinstall, it erased from my apps but still said I had it in my appstore which is completely false! Everytime I  hit ""uninstall"" on my amazon appstore the appstore completely closes. Very dissapointed"
42086,"Pandora",2016-07-16,5,"Great app for phone: pandora   I've been a Pandora subscriber for years and only recently added this app to my phone.  The same channels I created for my laptop/desktop automatically are there with phone app. No set up or cumbersome issues to get started with app"
42087,"Pandora",2012-01-24,5,"Beyond Awesome!!   I got this app for my T301 and it's AWESOME!  I can jam to the radio all day long for FREE!"
42091,"Pandora",2016-12-16,1,"Alarm clock feature broken   Whether it's Pandora's problem or Amazon's, this is a problem that MUST be fixed. If there's one thing in the modern world that absolutely ought to work no less than 100% of the time, it's an alarm clock. Pandora on kindle does not. It works sometimes, maybe. Sometimes Pandora starts playing by itself at inappropriate times (maybe alarm related?). Today my 5am alarm went off...at 12:38pm. Connected to the internet the whole time every time. Pandora is a great service, and I will change my review to 5 stars once this critical error is reversed and works consistently."
42093,"Pandora",2017-01-13,5,"PERFECT   Absolutely LOVE it......I am 57 y/o and completely new to this .......... for 1st day after getting first BT Speaker for working out n shop SO  The 1st day I tried that Heart station and within less than 4 hours started getting repeats and it was like having a short mp3 playlist ....got irritating and boing Real Quick...........DAY 2  Broke the HEART  and installed Pandora, clicked Jack Johnson station and  BLISS,  eclectic mix  and  it has been 3 days now and if there have been repeats I have not noticed because I am TOO Busy dancing and Loving it 100% !!  PERFECT"
42094,"Pandora",2016-08-11,5,"Pandora Music   Best music app - listen to it every day.  Option to block explicit lyrics is genius. Thumbs down on a song means you never have to hear it again.  Thumbs up and you get more songs similar to that one.  Absolutely brilliant."
42096,"Pandora",2017-03-25,5,"Most used app I have   Used everyday at work to listen to music makes work more bearable"
42099,"Pandora",2014-02-14,5,"Best music streaming app.   I love Pandora! I listen at home, in my car, at work, and everywhere in between. After a few months of teaching Pandora my likes versus dislikes, she truly has learned my tastes. When I change from my personal stations, I know exactly what I am going to get. I even enjoy mixing things up a bit when I dabble with the premade channels Pandora makes available.  They are very good but my personal preference are the stations I create by choosing my favorite songs and genres.  Great job Pandora."
42100,"Pandora",2016-11-09,5,"It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request   I'm impressed.  It delivers pretty much what I listen too or request.  No complaints."
42103,"Pandora",2016-11-04,5,"Five Stars   I love listening to my gospel music on this station"
42110,"Pandora",2014-04-08,5,"Awesome App!   Pandora is an amazing app to have if you want to listen to your favorite music and also hear new stuff just like what you love! They take the songs that you have liked and pick new songs to play based on what makes all of those songs the same. It's genious! Great  was to discover new stuff and new artists. And it's an alternative to the radio which plays mostly the same music and an get annoying."
42113,"Pandora",2015-03-31,3,"play what I want ...not pandora   The fact that Pandora continues to add ""stations""  turns an otherwise good idea into a normal/regular radio station which plays a large percentage of music one did not want to hear to begin with. Just because I like the Greatful Dead does not mean I will like Bob Marley for instance, so if I give something a thumbs down it should not form a. New radio station. And that's what makes Pandora suck, though the concept is great."
42116,"Pandora",2013-08-23,5,"music   ok"
42120,"Pandora",2014-04-22,4,"Love it!   I'm still getting used to Pandora, but so far, I think it is Awesome! Wish there was just a membership fee instead of having to purchase individual tracks. I like just setting the station and letting it go. It's nice to be able to listen to any type of music that fits my mood at the time. We also enjoy listening to the comedy skits, especially the old classics. So, in a nutshell, I like it so far!"

42128,"Pandora",2016-09-12,3,"Also the UI isn't super intuitive i   Not sure how to Close app on my Kindle (no 'x' top right to close). Other issues (delay, long silent pauses) may be due to my device, or cable connectivity (10GB), not the app, but I'm unclear. Also the UI isn't super intuitive i.e. how to look for other pre existing stations. But maybe I will like it more as I acclimate to the process. Thx!"

42144,"Pandora",2016-04-28,3,"Why I switched to Spotify.   A frustrating app at times. It will occasionally pop up an overly that demands you either give the song its showing a thumb up or a thumb down. The only way to regain control of the app with out giving a thumb up or a thumb down is to exit the app and restart it. Very annoying. Paying for premium does not give unlimited skips like Spotify does."
42154,"Pandora",2017-01-15,4,"Pandora   Some things about this irk me. You are supposed to be able to hear a song repeat after watching an ad, but it doesn't repeat. The ads are the same over and over. When I put a groups name in for my station, I want the majority of music from that group, not everyone but the group."
42155,"Pandora",2016-06-15,4,"Love it; listen to it constantly!   Exposed to a huge variety of music.  I didn't realize the many different types of music and artist I liked.  Con: classical music will be truncated - you will not hear an entire symphony"
42157,"Pandora",2011-12-31,3,"Pandora NO TuneIn YES   A friend recommended this app as a must have for my new fire, so i figured I would give it a try.  It's a nice enough app but wasn't what I was looking for at all. If you are looking for a BASIC music selection then this might work for you, if you have more eclectic tastes then I would suggest TuneIn (another free app)Why?First TuneIn is easier to navigate with a simple home page to start you off.Second right from the start you can see the wider variety of options available to you.TuneIn presents you with 4 main choices - TALK, SPORTS, LOCAL RADIO, & MUSICJust sticking with the music sections for comparative purposes Pandora gives you 23 ""genres"" and TuneIn 25 -I know what you're thinking - not that big a difference right?  That's what I thought too on my first glance - but when you check closer you see how really lacking Pandora is.  Since my main interest in an internet radio was the ability to access stations from around the world I will compare this ""genre"".1 of Pandora's 23 genres is ""World"" - click on it and you are presented with .... wait for it.... Reggae, Contemporary Bollywood, Celtic, Dancehall, Worldbeat, Hawaiian, Classic Bollywood, Dub, African Essentials, Ska, Contemporary Reggae, Indian Classical, CajunYUP 13 channels. Let's start by looking for some Jpop - no Asian choices so let's go with ""worldbeat"" right? Silly person that I am, I assumed that when you clicked on ""worldbeat"" you would be presented with more options to narrow down where in the world you would like to listen to right?  WRONG. Click the Worldbeat channel and it just starts playing songs from around the world.  Nice I guess, but not what I was looking for.In comparison click TuneIn's ""World"" genre and  - well look at that - the world's a little bit bigger than we thought!TuneIn gives you 37 regions of the world to help narrow down your choice (such as Africa, Arabic, Caribbean, Dutch, German, Irish, Japanese, Native, Polish, Romanian, Turkish & Vietnamese just to name a few!decide you want to search by language? That's not a problem either!) Let's get the Jpop started by clicking ""Japanese"".  Had this been the case I would have been more than satisfied!  But wait?  What is this?? click on Japanese and you will get this - ""Results 1 - 25 of about 257""  Wait??  You mean ALL Japanese music is not the same?? You are offered a range of stations from actual radio stations in Japan, to streaming internet stations such as a station from Herndon, VA(apparently nothing is better when you are snowed in then a little anime and jpop top 40!). Now just like your local community station on TV isn't going to compare to ABC or NBC, sometimes it IS what you are looking for.Both apps include commercials (which didn't bother me on either)A con for TuneIn is that sometimes the stations are not available, but with the large selection this isn't much of a setback.  TuneIn will also suggest similar stations if the one you want is currently unavailable. (Please note- I wasn't on Pandora enough to know if it occurs there as well.)TuneIn also offers features like a sleep function and an alarm setting (If Pandora has them they I didn't find them.)So overall, while I think Pandora is a fine app I really like the versatility of TuneIN."
42158,"Pandora",2015-11-10,5,"Love it   Love Pandora and the great variety available for the song mix It's easy to use whether listening to one genre or choosing to shuffle.

42167,"Pandora",2014-09-18,5,"Spectacular!   I LOVE Pandora!  I can listen to all my favorite artists and songs with the push of a button (or touch of a screen, rather).  The only downside is that you can't search specific songs.  You just have to create a station and hope for the song you want to hear.  Another great feature is that you can listen to stuff other than music too.  I have a comedy station that brings up comedian routines, not songs."
42169,"Pandora",2013-10-04,3,"Frustrated   I keep getting a constant message saying ""sorry, we have no more songs to play on this station,please select another."" I reported it numerous times to Pandora and I get the same response from them ""were sorry for the frustration..try this...were sorry try this...and try that..."" I've deactivated my account 4 times and it still keeps happening. I have Pandora One which is $3.99 a month and I'm ready to cancel it."

Plug it in your car, we use at cook outs, camping, just around the house while cleaning!"
42189,"Pandora",2017-01-17,5,"I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it   I used to use slacker radio all the time but i have recently switched to Pandora just for the option to mix my stations together. I listen about two hours every day while driving to and from work and i still haven't gotten bored with it. I do wish it would be easier to use with other devices, I usually hook up my laptop to my TV to use my whole house sound system while I'm cleaning, it would be so much easier to just play it from the Playstaion."
42198,"Pandora",2016-09-23,4,"All day listener   I enjoy Pandora and listen daily at work for lengthy periods. My only issue is that for the number of available songs within a specific genre, I'd prefer not to hear the same set of songs every two hours. The ability to add or remove artists to a channel has become more difficult while on mobile."

If you want to listen to one or two bands that you like, this works.This app has too many commercials compared to other apps of its type.The customization based on likes and dislikes is terrible. For 2, maybe 3, songs after you hit ""like"" it will play similar sounding songs, but it has gone far off track far more times than I would like.Pandora also does not carry nearly as many unheard of bands as another app that I frequently use."

It played one piece of Mozart music (from Eine Kliene Nacht Music. Really??? Can't you do better than that?))  Then it played some Beethoven.  Then it played an ad.  Two pieces of music, and then an ad.  I naively had visions of intelligent listening of classical music, but all I got were 2 pieces classical ""Pop"" music and then an ad.  I immediately removed it from my Kindle."

It is next to impossible to find the artists I love.  Antonio Maggie, Emmanuel Moire, Tiziano Ferro, Sinsemilia,  Paolo Meneguzzi, Povia. The app assumes I do not mean what I type in the search bar.  It is useless to me.  I emailed Pandora support, I heard nothing back. I will find another app that doesn't presume & actually reads my search criteria."
42236,"Pandora",2016-05-02,2,"Invasive permissions.   I have been with Pandora from the  beginning but as of late things are getting bad.Fix permissions. Stop asking for location data. This is a radio program you dont need to know where I am. It wold be ok but even with locations off you keep pestering for it to be on. No means no. Pandora permissions keep getting more invasive. Creepy. If it isn't fixed will swap to new app.If you have older versions dont updated."
42238,"Pandora",2015-06-22,1,"Advertisements everywhere   This app is full of advertisements, even more than the website has. I was okay with the ads between songs but now the app plays video ads between songs too. There's also a ad in left hand corner so whenever I like or dislike a song I am hit with another ad. All the ads I get between every song has ruined this app for me."

42273,"Pandora",2017-07-05,2,"So repetive!   It doesn't matter if I listen to a station for 3 hours or 20; I can thumbs up and down all day long and still it plays the same 20 songs by  the same10 artist. I normally listen everyday while I get ready for work. I'm so sick of some songs and artists by the end of the week I have to delete them from the station: Katy Perry, Lady GaGa, Journey, Hootie and The Blowfish, Goo Goo Dolls and LL Cool J are this weeks victims. Everytime I click any station it's the same five songs that start it. Every. Single. Time. This is great when Iove a new tund. It's torture otherwise. The whole app is more often than not, a waste to me. Sure, I like that song but I dont want to hear it every single day in almost the exact order. I'll just listen to the radio if I want the same stuff over and over. I have about 10 stations I made, 5-10 others made and there is no difference between how often it overplays each song. I've tried the shuffle feature and somehow end up with Christmas music every 3rd song. There used to be an ""add variety"" feature but I've had no luck finding it on my Kindle. The app, for me, is only good for very limited use. Likewise, I don't always have limitless hours to thumbs up or down so on some stations that has made the listening experience almost painful. I used to appreciate the Genome aspect for finding songs I would enjoy. Now it's just a hassle."
42274,"Pandora",2016-03-16,1,"Doesn't work   I had 2 stations, and none of the songs would play. Advertisements worked as well as commercials, but the songs wouldn't play, and would switch after a couple of minutes as if they did. Tried restarting a couple of times and that didn't work. Ridiculous."
42275,"Pandora",2016-09-18,5,"Pandora is My Favorite   What's not to love about Pandora?  Free music of my choice, artists of my choice, and the option to shuffle music for hours on end.

42399,"Pandora",2016-07-18,2,"Ads ads ads   Too many ads, ads are too long, and I wish I had the ability to opt out of live performances. Hearing people scream ""WOOO"" the entire song isn't exactly pleasurable."

42409,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Great app - listen to it all the time.   I really like this app.  I was able to cancel my Sirius subscription and save money.  I use it on my smartphone in my car and in my home.  At home, I connect to a bluetooth speaker.  When a call comes in, the music is silenced until I finish the call and then it automatically starts playing music again.  Unlimited music selection."
42410,"Pandora",2016-12-12,1,"Not happy with new version   I am getting tired of the newest version opening up no matter what I don't want.  I exited out of it 5 x yesterday. After I quit.  I may have to delete."

So would all of my friends.Less adds of course,the usual complaint.A replay or repeat button, which I think half of the internet would like.I would really like to be Abel to make a collection of songs to just put on repeat. If there is one pls tell me. I've looked everywhere."

42417,"Pandora",2014-09-04,4,"Great selection of music   There is a great selection of music. Only bad thing about it is there is no way to like or dislike a song when the phone is in locked mode.  If there is a way to like/dislike a song while phone is in locked mode, then it will be superb."
42418,"Pandora",2015-09-06,5,"love it   I love it you get free music but there's only one thing i hate you need Wi-Fi it drives me crazy because at my house we dont got Wi-Fi but on the way to school i use the Wi-Fi my bus driver has but any way great app it has all the music u ask for get it its great"

42435,"Pandora",2013-08-31,5,"lots of fun   this definitely has every song on it that you can possibly think of... except for dave chappell which sucks. i listen to it all day at work, but be prepared for it to almost immediately drain the battery of any device that you are using to listen to it."

I assumed I would like heaing music on my computer as well but I found the music distracts me for my activity.  That's why I only gave it three stars.

42571,"Pandora",2014-05-04,4,"New Suggestion!   Ok, I absolutely love this app, I mean I don't have Pandora1 and I still love it, minimum ads,  free music, AND comedian stations. There is just one suggestion I have, and I'm sure others will agree. All the time I accidentally hit the ""like"" or ""dislike"" button, and you can't undo it unless you change it to the other. My suggestion is that we are able to unclick the ""like"" and ""dislike"" button, but other than that it's great."
42573,"Pandora",2012-12-09,1,"help w/app   can someone help me...I downloaded pandora but can't find the app on my kindle fire vs to listen?  I am a new kindle user - thanks"

42590,"Pandora",2013-02-05,5,"Great Padio Service   I really like his service.  I have three differnt statons programmed.  You have to fool with it a bit to get the individual statons playing your requested format, but they give Artist info and usually a list of ""like"" artists which you can add as ""seeds"".After a while, your ""station"" will be playing, pretty much, the genre  you desire, along with a bunch of additions you forgot, didn't think  of, or never heard of.Be patient!It'll come around.You can ""Thumbs down"" selections you don't want.I love it!One caveat . . . it is not""gender"" selective.Keep at it for a while, and you will be pleased."
42592,"Pandora",2016-12-12,5,"Works Well On Fire Devices   I've had and used Pandora for many years and just downloaded it to my Fire device, so there is not a whole lot I can say about the program itself.

42597,"Pandora",2012-12-19,3,"Sounds good   Like the sound quality..Too bad you can't download the songs or repeat the songs you like, but it puts together some amazing playlists. 5 stars for the price and sound quality, but minus 2 stars for the reasons mention."

42605,"Pandora",2013-10-18,1,"Inflexible   I found the inability to skip unwanted tracks simply unacceptable.  Program was deleted.  Amazon says I didn't use enough words so I added this sentence."
42606,"Pandora",2016-12-16,5,"Pandora is a very neat and free streaming music service.   I use this with Bluetooth in my car to stream mostly jazz thru my auto's system. I like the ability to enter the specific artist whose style of music you prefer and find artists few people have even heard of. I have the free service with few commercials that really do not bother me as they as so short."
42607,"Pandora",2016-06-11,3,"Play the entire price of music instead of cutting off, I paid for no commercials, is that cost too?   I like Pandora, I even paid extra not to get the commercials, but why does the music cut off before it is not finished. That's a bummer, enjoying, the boom, it stops and goes to something else."
42608,"Pandora",2013-01-18,5,"lovely app   Now for free I can listen to my favourite bands! One direction and rihanna and Nicki minaj at my finger tips!"
42612,"Pandora",2013-06-26,1,"Now it has comercials great way to ruin a good think   They have changed Pandora it used to be great you didn't pick your songs but there was no commercials so unless you pay you have to listen to there crap."

42627,"Pandora",2013-10-30,1,"doesn't work   This is potentially a great music app. At first it worked, then now all I get is the blue pandora logo screen. I cannot sign into it."
42636,"Pandora",2013-10-08,5,"the best radio for music. ......A MUST GET!!!   Pandora is amazing... it lets you choose the music that you want to hear and pick your own station's. And once you get more than one station, the songs that you like will be played more often."
42638,"Pandora",2013-12-04,1,"crash master   Kindle fire first gen. Pandora sucks on it. Don't do it. Nothing but crashes and having to re-install. Use something else."

42649,"Pandora",2016-01-31,1,"Skip Pandora.  You want SPOTIFY!   Like many people, when I first heard of the concept of ""free music"" I rushed to download this Pandora app.  And for a while, it met all my needs.  However, there is a better player in town now and his name is Spotify Music.  If you just want random background noise (random music) that you have little control over, then sure...Pandora will suffice.  But if you want to actually pick the song (and not just the genre!) of what you are going to listen to...then you want Spotify Music .If you still aren't convinced though, a few more facts to help you make your decision:PANDORA1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $4.99/month.3. Library size - 1 million+ songs.4. Can user pick song? NO.5. Can user skip songs? Yes.  But with limitations.  6 skips per hour, per station. No more than 30 skips in 24 hours.SPOTIFY1. Free version has ads and limitations.2. Premium service is $1 for 3 month trial.

42683,"Pandora",2017-06-09,3,"The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good   I was under the impression that the music available on the Echo was free.  However, I found I had to subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited to get the music (which was the reason I bought the item).  There appears to be no mixing on the sequence of songs by artists.  When I ask for a specific artist, it seems to always start with the same song.  The sound quality and volume is good and Elexa response is quick and good.  I will caution those who ask me about the Echo's need for subscribed music."

I'll be ju jumping ship and moving to the iphone.. You're just asking to be hacked, (banking email etc.) by installing applications with how many permissions...Only an idiot would install such apps..I kind of blame amazon for not screening these app and requiring them to be permission free..."

The only thing I don't like is when I choose a song from a performer as a ""radio"" the song doesn't play.  I have to wait for it to eventually come up.  For instance I really, really wanted to hear ""Over the Rainbow"" by the wonderful Hawaiian singer so I clicked on the song and added it to my ""radio.""  Another song played and I never could get Over the Rainbow.  Other than that, I love Pandora and love the ease that I can add it to my car, my tablets, phone, etc.  Very user friendly."

42924,"Pandora",2014-02-10,5,"Just great music your style and choice   This is a perfect product for me because I have a Genre that has a handful of artists I know of,  but the intelligence will seek others that I've never heard of.

42935,"Pandora",2013-02-12,1,"Pandora great but not on Kindle Fire   Pandora One on Kindle Fire frustrates. You cannot use Pandora without being nagged to upgrade to One. When you follow the link you cannot go to the Pandora web site even though the option is presented. You must go to the Amazon store which is frustrating in itself. At the Amazon store, you have to search for Pandora One and it then only finds Pandora. If you ever do get to Pandora One in the Amazon store it will not download or install. Pandora is great. Amazon Store is frustrating and I hesitate to use it"
42941,"Pandora",2016-08-09,1,"No.   This app is very confusing. I cant make playlists of one song, instead i have to listen to WHOLE ALBUMS. Another problem is when im listening to my favorite band, it switches to a different band for me that i probably dont want to listen to. And on top of that is the CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENTS. I know that advertising is in all apps but i DONT WANT AN ADD AFTER EVERY SINGLE SONG. Overall, one star pandora, im switching to spotify."

42969,"Pandora",2016-04-19,1,"update broke App completely -   As stated, last update broke Pandora completely & now hangs instead of loading. When working I'd give it 5 stars - the alarm feature is particularly a plus & when broken it disrupts waking up to Pandora. ..One other thing - Pandora One has promised to work on upgrading stream quality beyond full-blown computers & five years later it's DOA - disappointing."

42999,"Pandora",2017-04-26,2,"It use to be music, now it is ads   Use to be great. I could hear two or three songs before getting an ad. That is totally fair for free music. Sometimes, you could watch a short video and get a free hour, which was awesome.Now it is crap. It will play one song, maybe two,  then three to four ads. In a 30 minute time frame I'm hearing more ads then music.It has a ""Why ads"" option, which just tells you to upgrade. Nope, not upgrading, I'm just going to find another option."

43015,"Pandora",2012-11-16,1,"This app is worthless   I installed Pandora twice in my phone and it didn't work correctly either time.  It only plays about 30 seconds of the songs and skips to the next one. Who wants to listen to music like that?  I love Pandora on my pc but hate it on my phone.  I use IHR on my phone now."

43022,"Pandora",2016-04-14,4,"OK   Glitches every once in awhile. I'm not an over the top enthusiast or mater, but this is not the best, still pretty good and that's that. Nothing else to it"

Those pirates charged me 99 because apparently I reached my limit of free music for April. Well it's April 4 And I barely even listen to it. Either they fix this or I sue them for lieing about what their product offers. Free music my a$$."
43052,"Pandora",2017-04-28,5,"Awsome, but needs more   I love this app. I have adhd and I use Pandora to help fall asleep. I really like how it picks up what type of music you like.

43086,"Pandora",2017-04-15,5,"Love it   Its a great way for me to find new music that I love and I can also share new music with my bestie! I can work on homework and not have to sing the same songs repeatedly! My review: love it!!!"
43091,"Pandora",2017-05-31,4,"Music to drive by....   Finally followed advice to try this music site. Using free option for listening. Thought by choosing my singer it would be all their music but includes similar genre singers. Ok but not what I expected."
43092,"Pandora",2017-04-21,4,"Kewl :}   Its great!!! :D!! The only bad things are that it puts on random songs (and some are annoying ._.) and that you can't search :\,Otherwise its great!!!! :)"
43093,"Pandora",2017-06-07,5,"Five Stars   I listen to this everyday. Very addictive."
43099,"Pandora",2012-11-24,5,"Pandora's great!   What can I say.  I just discovered Pandora and I love being able to have just the music I want.  there are some commercials but so what, not anymore than you would get on a radio station,(if as many) and you get just what you want."
43100,"Pandora",2012-05-19,5,"great!   this is a good app. it is free, it has a lot of songs, and it is easy to use. Pandora has a lot of songs and genres, too.  this app only has a few downsides, it can only skip 6 times per hour per station, and when you thumbs down a song, a song by the same person plays. that part is slightly annoying.  some people want this app to upgrade, which makes sense. it has a few flaws. But some people don't know that there is already an upgrade for it. it is called Pandora One. it has more songs, genres, and handles skipping and ""artists that you don't like"" very well. this costs $40 a year, but you can have it with all of your devices. you sign in to Pandora with your email, so as long as you you use the same email for all of your devices, you can have Pandora one on all of them. I hope this helps anyone who likes Pandora.  I trust Pandora more than any other radio app. this is because most songs are clean, espicaly if you are searching the right songs/music. thank you for your time."
43101,"Pandora",2016-06-25,5,"Great!!!   This app lwets you listen to the songs you love and let's you learn some, as well."
43105,"Pandora",2016-06-13,5,"Great music app!   I enjoy being able to listen to any radio station and any genre I want. I sing in the Choir at my Church and I can find the songs we are singing and enjoying listening to what I want."
43107,"Pandora",2015-03-10,5,"Pandora custom radio   Pandora is a very user friendly radio app. Its song library is huge, and the programming works great. This online music service allows you create custom radio stations based on genres of music, artists, and even specific songs. As you listen, Pandora lets you rate songs by giving a thumbs up or down, or skip tracks altogether. This helps it figure out your likes and dislikes to create a playlist perfectly unique to you.  It's important to be an active listener for the algorithm to do its job. Recently, the app added a great new feature, alarm clock. Now you can wake up to your favorite Pandora stations instead of the same old buzzing sounds of your usual alarm clock. I find this app especially helpful when I exercise.  I like to listen to upbeat music during a workout but get so tired of preset playlists.  This is an app I use daily."
43108,"Pandora",2016-12-15,5,"It's cool   I really enjoy the variety Pandora offers, hate the commercials but still not nearly as bad as regular radio. And finding stations to stream lets me not only enjoy very specific artists but artists associated with them or the time period of the music."
43110,"Pandora",2013-07-25,4,"Music Enjoyment While Cooking   I was very excited to get the Kindle Pandora app.  It is very nice to play music while I cook using the online recipes found on Pinterest or various other websites on my Kindle.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was how to quit Pandora at first.  There is a Quit option, but you must be on the main screen (the one that displays your stations) to utilize it.  My Kill app wasn't even able to shut it down.  I try to conserve battery life as much as possible.  Once I found that Quit option I was much happier with the app."
43117,"Pandora",2016-11-21,4,"Allows access to your Pandora station listing   The app allows access to your previously selected stations.  Functions well. Making changes to any of your selections is easier by visiting the website, then use the app to access what you have already set up."
43119,"Pandora",2015-12-19,5,"Awesome!   Pandora saves lives! I listen to Pandora religiously. It adds different music to the station based on things you indicate that you like. It sometimes repeats songs maybe an hour or two after listening to the station but it doesn't happen frequently. I wouldn't know what I would do without this app!"
43124,"Pandora",2013-04-12,5,"best thing since sliced bread   I bought me a blue tooth portable speaker ( soundfreq) highly recommend it.  Then logged into pandora with my kindle and wallah i have have a wireless speaker system for my backyard bbq.  Works just like the pandora on the laptop but now its more mobile with my kindle and if someone doesn't like the music i just type in what they like and there happy.  I did have problems getting a specific song but it really didn't matter maybe this is available on the pay pandora i just had the free version.  Everyone was impressed with it and now we have music outdoors."
43126,"Pandora",2013-01-15,4,"awesome music app   great free app for music. I have this app on all my devices including my iPhone, iPad and kindle. The only reason I gave this product 4/5 stars is because of the ads and you are only to skip a song a total of 5 or 6 Times per channel a day. Other than that I would recommend this app"
43130,"Pandora",2012-09-22,5,"Love the new update!   this new update lets you view the lyrics and I love it! And they play the same ad over and over because that's who payed for it duh !"

43133,"Pandora",2017-05-15,3,"Music, Music, Music   Sound quality on a kindle is not that great.  Also, if you stop thumbing, it shuts off."
43134,"Pandora",2017-08-15,5,"Best streaming option.   Absolutely the best source of music streaming.  Not that there aren't other good ones...  Pandora is just a little above all of the others.  Pandora gives you 3 choices of service level. I recently switched from ""some"" commercials to the lower of two commercial free options.  All 3 are good to listen to, but I think I will be at this ""mid-level"" of service for some time to come.  I really appreciate the ability to listen off line when there is no good streaming source available."
43135,"Pandora",2016-07-14,5,"I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite ...   I like Pandora because it allows me to select my favorite artists and also the suggestions of artists that are similar to the ones that I selects which introduce me to new artists."

43140,"Pandora",2017-05-26,5,"#1 Music app ever   Pandora Great music app, one of my favorite."
43147,"Pandora",2017-06-07,2,"Cancelled my paid subscription.   I've been a Pandora One customer for four years. Today I cancelled my subscription. Why? Because they went from allowing two devices to stream at one time to just one device at a time. No notice. No email or anything explaining the change. Just BAM! Sorry, you can't do that anymore. When I contacted them they didn't seem to overly care that they made this change without any notice. They were willing to log me out of any and all devices and force me to change my password but to be able to stream on two devices at the same time meant paying for another account (at a higher rate). I would now have TWO accounts. One paying the same I'd paid for the last four years: $3.99 and the new account paying MORE at $4.99. No thanks."

43154,"Pandora",2016-08-09,5,"Stays connected to the internet   After trying several other on line music apps to use on my Kindle, this one seems to be the best.  The others regularly would lose their connection and take a long time to reconnect to the internet (if they'd reconnect at all).  Pandora seems to have a very strong connection.  Pandora also has a very extensive collection of all genres of music.  It also doesn't inundate you with repetitive advertisements and announcements.  Pandora has proven itself to be an excellent way to have background music throughout my house."
43157,"Pandora",2016-06-14,5,"I love this app   I love this app!  So easy to use! And free is always awesome!I love to have it playing all day.  I love the mix that Pandora generates.I can listen to whatever style of music matches my mood that day!"
43164,"Pandora",2017-09-15,5,"Fan for Years   I've been a fan of Pandora for years with my computer, my phone, and now my tablet.  I get to pick the music, even if we have to go back to the 1940s to get the songs and bands that play real music, not just noise."
43167,"Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"Pandora is awesome :)   Omg Pandora is so cool you can listen to all different types of music and it is just so awesome"
43170,"Pandora",2017-05-31,1,"Crapiest radio app ever.   Its the dumbest radio app ever, when I'm using my aunts internet (its rlly good internet) it says ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""When I'm at a laundry mat, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My house, ""no internet connection. Please try again later."" My parents house ""no internet connection. Please try again later.""  This app is the crapiest app ever. I don't think you should get this app. IHeartRaido is way better than this. Fix it. I wish I could give this 0 stars."
43172,"Pandora",2016-07-07,4,"Great App!   I love Pandora! Great Channels, great music, everything! But, some songs are super laggy and other times the apps closes on me and stops playing music. Is there were no problems, I would rate this app five star."
43180,"Pandora",2013-06-23,5,"Pandora is my Magic Box   Music is my passion. I love many genres.  However, it was difficult to know how to access new music.  By creating my personal stations on Pandora, I have been introduced to many new artists that are now part of my musical world.  I listen to Pandora every day, and am constantly surprised by new and beautiful songs and instrumentals.  I then have new materials for creating my own Playlists, when I purchase music.  Pandora is truly my Magic Box. What a gift!  I subscribe by the month at minimal cost and it's worth every penny!"
43181,"Pandora",2017-02-02,5,"Amazing   This app is so cool! You dont need wifi so you can listen to you fav songs anywhere!! This is my favorite app👌😁😆"
43183,"Pandora",2013-09-08,5,"Replacing Radio   I was introduced to Pandora when I bought my Roku about 2-3 years ago.  I am so tired of traditional radio, hearing the same old stuff from 40 years ago, even current music, they play to death.  With Pandora, even if you chose a musical group from 40 years ago, you can hear all of their tracks, not just the ones they play on traditional radio.  You also will hear musical groups from the same Genre.  You can chose any group you like.  Pandora offers an upgrade without commercials, even if you get free Pandora, the commercials/ads are not that long, and you are back to hearing your favorite music.  I recommend Pandora to everyone!"

This is my first time trying Pandora I really like it as soon as you touch the icon it pops up and it starts playing your music and I love that you have so many choices to choose from someone calls that call ends and it comes right back on I love that I know there's lots of other options and I haven't had it long enough to actually get into that an like read all about it I plan on doing that because you can actually like download songs and take them like anywhere with you so anywhere you're at you have your favorite music and I love that too try it out you'll love it too"
43189,"Pandora",2015-08-08,5,"Pandora music your way, you choice!   I truly enjoy this app for music.  I choose what I want to hear, and when I want to hear it.  I have the capability to set music stations that I like the way I like.  I have stations to get me going, stations for background, and for falling to sleep.  The commercials are not a deterrent for me, there are less than the radio.  Which by the way I never listen to now, Pandora all the time."
43191,"Pandora",2017-09-07,1,"A decade behind!!!   I remember when this app first came out I freaking loved it it was the future but about three years ago I switched to Spotify and I've been there ever since. Anyways my friend brought up Pandora the other day so I thought I'd see what Pandora has been up to. What happened to them? Since I left Pandora I've gotten a promotion gotten a raise I've even got a new car and my home is even smarter now while Pandora has only updated the page look that's it a new shinny page."
43198,"Pandora",2017-05-03,5,"Pandora is the absoute best for music listening!   Love Pandora!  Listen to it every day!  Love that I can listen to different genre's of music depending on my mood."

43204,"Pandora",2012-12-16,4,"I like the app   I like this Pandora app for Kindle.  It plays fine & I have not had any problem with force closing.  The only thing I don't like is the pop-ups during play. It doesn't interfere with the player,  I just don't care for it."
43211,"Pandora",2017-10-13,5,"Five Stars   Easy and love it!"
43213,"Pandora",2017-07-20,5,"Love music!   Love music!!! Love Pandora!!!  The best music selection from oldies to today's greatest hits.  Whatever my mood is Pandora will oblige.My brother is in a nursing home and wanted to listen to some Al Green.  He is very old school, does not know anything about streaming or apps.  As soon as I hit play, ""It was ON!""  My brother was singing, his roommate was singing, I was swaying and singing and even some of the nurses were swaying and singing.  We had a BLAST!!!  Nursing homes, are depressing places. But not that day; there was lot of spirit lifting going on.  Thank you Pandora for having the perfect selection of music."
43214,"Pandora",2017-08-09,3,"Used to be great. Not so much anymore. Get spotify.   The playlists can range from outstanding to complete garbage. Also, there are way too many ads. Pandora has fallen far."
43216,"Pandora",2014-12-01,5,"Love my Pandora.   Love Pandora. I can listen to all types of music. I have at least 20 different styles of music and keep adding to when I hear something I like. I love to put it on shuffle when I am reading and listen to everything from meditative and instrumental to oriental and classical. Money well spent."
43217,"Pandora",2013-08-29,1,"well it was good!   This was a fantastic app until one day it decided to stop working. Nothing more than a blue Pandora screen now :("
43226,"Pandora",2012-12-29,5,"Edgy, Artistic Opportunity   Many prior reviewers have bemoaned the number of ads on Pandora stations, to which I reply: So? The ads are less frequent, less lengthy, and less disruptive than on a typical Clear Channel broadcast station. Considering the number and range of songs Pandora provides, and that royalties consume much more of digital radio's revenue than broadcast, I don't begrudge them paying for themselves. Since the ads aren't loud, I can handle a few interruptions.I'm more impressed by the fact that Pandora offers a wide array of music in nearly every genre, including music too edgy or dangerous for conglomerate-owned media outlets. Especially for those of us who live in the hinterlands, Pandora provides an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with music we would never otherwise encounter. I've been able to broaden my exposure to indie rock, international and ethnic music, daring composers, and innovative singer-songwriters.And getting it for my smartphone has been a real boost. I'm able to connect the provider to my car radio, the stereo at work, or my headphones, and carry my innovative music around with me. The sound is clear and translates well onto larger speakers, meaning I can enjoy it on my commute or my morning exercise regimen without having to accept diminished quality. Getting this for my phone has been a real blessing, one I intend to continue enjoying."
43234,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"... long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up   It didn't take very long for Pandora to figure out exactly what I like. A few thumbs up, a few thumbs down, and I have hours of the music that I want to hear (not what a local station thinks that I want to hear). The work goes faster and easier with Pandora - yard work, house work, and even re-roofing the house. Yes, 14 months spent re-roofing the house while listening to Pandora! It has my thumbs up."
43238,"Pandora",2017-02-01,5,"I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind ...   I absolutely love pandora. I use everyday and I don't mind the advertisements which is why I would pay for the no adds deal. Now since they update the get more skip buy watch a video is more pleasing to my enjoyment."
43239,"Pandora",2017-01-02,3,"Some things ARE never ending.   Although it's free, it could be very annoying when your working hard for a couple of hours and enjoying the music, but then it shuts off to ask if you're still listening!!! Good music, and sounds like a radio with commercials, but stop asking if we're still listening, someone will eventually turn it off or change it to their liking."
43242,"Pandora",2016-06-09,5,"Music everywhere!   I love taking my music where ever I go! A lot easier than I thought it would be to find what I would like. Even the commercials aren't as bad as you find on the radio."
43247,"Pandora",2016-05-17,5,"Music Site Of Choice   I've used Pandora for many years. It's one of the only websites I remember off bat when getting ready to hear some music off line. The best site, it looked like from the best search engine and now my perspective. I believe I chose the best one. It's not complicated to navigate or anything. I built a playlist on the video hosting site, youtube.com, bases off the best songs pandora.com was playing for me. It's called Christine's Music Playlist. It has a link and over 400 songs that are all favorites. Pandora really is the best of the web."
43249,"Pandora",2016-09-28,4,"Love music!   I really like the variety of music. I have mine on shuffle so I will have a 60's song, then a country, then rock and roll! It is great, except of course the commercials, but there are like gobs of them!"
43252,"Pandora",2017-10-04,5,"Can't go wrong   With being able to listen and at the same time make your own channels"
43253,"Pandora",2013-02-03,5,"A Godsend to Music Lovers!   How long have I been listening to Pandora? Since before it WAS Pandora and it was MSN Music, that's how long ago I've been a fan! I realize that there are other streaming music channels out there but when you achieve perfection, WHY switch?Thanks to Pandora, my work and personal life is so much richer. I have over 52 different channels on Pandora, from Patti Page, to Lionel Hampton, Pink Martini, Nils Frahm, Windham Hill, to 5 different Christmas stations (which I'm embarrassed to admit, I listen to throughout the year!). I have learned SO much more about the different genres that I enjoy, from Pop, Jazz, Blues, Alternative, Classical that Pandora should proudly take a bow, just on the education factor!If you go just a hare's breath beyond the standard listening feature, there's a wee box of ""arrows"" that you click so you can find out 1) Lyrics to most songs; 2) About the Artist; 3) WHY Pandora is using that particular artist i.e. ""Accoustic rhythm piano; intricate phrasing."" You also have the ability to ""Bookmark"" any song that you like, so you don't have to scramble for a pen/paper to remember ""Who WAS that awesome artist?""And, if you take the small effort to ""Thumb's Up/Down"" a song every now and then, Pandora can broaden their knowledge of your music and they add more songs of that ilk to your stations. Thank you, Pandora!Because I have a Zune membeship, what I do is take my bookmarked songs/artists and then investigate them further through Zune, usually downloading the entire album. A person can't be everywhere at one time and by listening to Pandora, I discover the ENTIRE world of music, not just the tiny part I know.And ""Yes!"", I'm a paid member for Pandora.One, a yearly Christmas gift I give myself and Pandora, applauding what they give to me, daily. Frankly, what else can you buy for less than a dime a day that delivers so much? :)"
43254,"Pandora",2016-09-21,5,"What's not to love?   What's not to love? Pick your music choices, use shuffle for a mix up and there is your evening's background music."
43256,"Pandora",2017-07-13,5,"Good music you like. You pick what you want to listen too...free   Pandora is a great music app. Even though it doesn't play a specific song it allows you to pick a specific music category that you enjoy listening to. I use it often and because it's free it's even better."
43257,"Pandora",2017-01-24,5,"Best site for music   I have been listening Pandora for years, I think is the best site for the variety, versatility and you can use your profile from any device, and plus the free version is very good for me. I would recommend it"
43258,"Pandora",2014-03-08,5,"PANDORA   THIS IS THE GREATEST OFFER FOR LISTENING TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC. I WANTED TO HEAR MUSIC LIKE BONNIE RAIT AND BY SELECTING THIS ARTIST ON PANDORA,  IT PLAYED HER AND  MUSICIANS LIKE HER AND IT WAS GREAT. THEN I WANTED TO HEAR SOME SOFT EASY LISTENING PIANO MUSIC TO READ BY AND SELECTED FLOYD CRAMMER AND YES PANDORA, BROUGHT UP FLOYD CRAMMER AND OTHER GREAT PIANIST.  MY HUSBAND ENJOYS MUSICIAN LIKE HANK, WAYLON & WILLY SO, NOW HE CAN HEAR HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS AND OTHERS LIKE THESE ARTIST. WE HAVE HAD PANDORA FOR A MONTH AND WE BOTH ENJOY LISTENING TO OUR PANDORA.WE TURN IT ON AND LISTENING TO IT ALL DAY AS WE GO ABOUT OUR DAY AT HOME. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
43261,"Pandora",2017-04-29,2,"New website stinks!   The new site is awful!  It is significantly more complicated to use, especially when editing stations.  This now requires a four step process instead of one.  How stupid is that?!?!?  The new site wastes so much space that could be used for navigation purposes.  Music and cost is the same, but the new site STINKS!!!  It's like going back in time 10 years."
43263,"Pandora",2014-04-05,4,"For music lovers   I came on this site by accident and fell in love with it.  I love to listen to music and there is so much to pick from it is hard to make up my mind.  There is something for everyone from oldies from the 40's and 50's to current hits; instrumental to vocal to show songs.  Most are free which does come with some ads which can be disconcerting because they come in when you least expect them, but there are not many.  For anyone who likes music this is a good purchase."
43265,"Pandora",2013-02-28,1,"sucks   Disowned to Kindle Fire only displays the background. No functional use. Guess I have to wait and download at another time. That sucks!"
43266,"Pandora",2017-09-06,5,"The greatest. I gave up the radio a long time ago.   I have subscribed to Pandora for years. It is great to have on our Amazon ""Alexa"". All I have to do is open the station I want, ""Alexa, Hillsong from Pandora"". Then as I listen to the songs I tell Alexa, I like this song or I don't like this song"". If it is saved as a ""like"" or a ""dislike"" I am building my own station."

43287,"Pandora",2017-10-14,5,"Pandora   I love Pandora it's so cool !!!!"
43288,"Pandora",2015-04-24,3,"Pandora works sometimes   I've been using Pandora for about 2 years now and it's satisfied me as well as annoy the heck out of me. For example the ads can come up a lot or If I'm on the Slipknot radio and I hear a song from a band called Sevendust, I remember that I actually want to listen to more songs by Sevendust so I go ahead and play the Sevendust radio, but get this, Slipknot or some softcore rock starts playing! I'm not sure if it's just my Android phone but the quality tends to play at a lower rate even after I toggled the settings to play only on high(I have unlimited data, so it's not a problem for me). It's free so it's worth it but if you're thinking of getting Pandora One(Premium Membership) that lets you skip more track and no ads, then go to Spotify instead, it's a lot better in my opinion."
43290,"Pandora",2013-03-14,5,"Get this app!   Pandora is a really great app because you can type in your favorite artist or song and it will give you a station of that song, other songs by that artist, and similar songs. You can rate a song with a thumbs down, and it will never play again on that song! If you get Pandora you won't regret it, because you can follow other people with similar tastes and see what they are listening to. I have only one complaint, you can only skip 6 songs per hour/station. There are ads, but overall Pandora is really great."
43291,"Pandora",2016-10-24,3,"No difference   I don't see a replay button. The new app looks exactly the same."
43292,"Pandora",2017-08-17,5,"Five Stars   I have really enjoyed it."
43299,"Pandora",2013-01-16,4,"Radio Service   It's easy to access,  otherwise in this remote area Olympic Peninsula we have no radio service. I've been able to get all the types of music I enjoy listening to without interrupting ads or new broadcasts or sports!"
43301,"Pandora",2016-04-17,1,"won't play, 3rd update in a row.   The ads seem to load just fine, but the music plays for usually 1 second and it pauses, and hitting play doesn't work.  This is the 3rd update in a row that has done this. This was nice when it worked."
43302,"Pandora",2017-08-11,3,"Three Stars   It's ok, too many ads"
43303,"Pandora",2017-02-09,5,"I really enjoy the variety of music I can listen to   LUV, LUV, LUV Pandora!  I really enjoy the variety of music I can listen to, depending on my mood.  Thanks, Pandora!"

I find it allows me to jump from Classic Rock to Top 40 depending on my mood.  This was recommended by my daughter, so I was skeptical.  Guess what? It's working well with my kindle and Blue tooth headset."
43311,"Pandora",2015-04-16,5,"personalized radio   I have been using this app for year and prefer it over all the other music/radio apps. You can create your on stations to your own personal music genre and like or dislike select songs that play randomly. The song that you have given thumbs up to starts to store on that particular station so it can play as often as you like. It's almost like creating your own CD, but, you can add more stations and add select artist to that one particular station of your choice. In my opinion this app is easy to use and plays awesome music!!!"
43312,"Pandora",2014-02-09,5,"A programable music station catering to what you want to hear!   I haven't used Pandora for quite awhile so I didn't know what to expect.  I was surprised to find it easy to use and it's free.  Not many bargains like this today.  You can pick one or more genres of music you like and listen to it all day.  Create several stations of what you like and it will continuously load music.  You can dislike a selection and it will immediately go to another song.  You can chose either one of your stations or intermix your stations.  Share your stations with others also.  What's not to like."
43314,"Pandora",2016-05-11,1,"Prepubescent creation at best! Do not expect Factual information   I simply cannot believe Pandora expects people to PAY for service!1. The lyrics to songs are either wrong or non-existent. I've come across so many lyrics that have nothing to do with the current song playing!2. If I were the artist, as to the Biography that was written about me, I would definitely contact someone at Pandora as they appear to be total idiots! How can anyone unintentionally, put in a biography about an artist, that isn't about that artist? O.o That fact is beyond "" Sloppy"" it's entirely Unprofessional!!!!3. When creating a new station for the genre I enjoy, I am constantly given tracks that are not even in the same realm... ??? O.o So I sit and one after another, Thumbs down to the track.. How do they come up with this?Mr.Westergren's statement as to Pandora competing with iTunes is ludicrous as it appears that Pandora is put together by a group of prepubescent children experimenting with a music program."
43318,"Pandora",2016-11-15,5,"*The* way to listen to music   An excellent selection of music from all genres interrupted only occasionally by a single short commercial message."
43319,"Pandora",2014-02-23,5,"Love it...it's a must-have. Kindle Fire HD (original)   Easy to use, and a TON of musical genres are available. If you have the Fire HD with Dolby speakers (as I do), it offers a great listening experience. It's just like a radio station (commercials), but with music you select yourself. It's especially great if you happen to live in a rural farming town that only gets bad country music stations and Jesus radio. Yep, I'm stuck in the sticks and Pandora has probably saved my sanity. Well, whatever little I have left anyway. hahahaha"

43465,"Pandora",2013-08-27,5,"Good Music   Man, I am so glad that I was able to get this music station, I had heard about it and did not know where I could get it. It is a wonderful station, playing music by your selective artist and than following up with artist of the same quality. Thank you."
43466,"Pandora",2017-08-09,5,"Thank god for good music to train to just love all the adds makes me happy to be alive   Just love it keeps my group of 3 percenters hyped up during our anti  Antifa training at planet fittness lol."
43477,"Pandora",2013-07-29,4,"Good selection of music   Good selection of music....just tooooooo many commercials.  I understand the concept, but they pop up at the most inconvenient times.  Other than that, I like the app"
43478,"Pandora",2017-02-06,5,"I love it. I can put on a station on ...   I love it. I can put on a station on the 50's music and it plays songs that I love and have forgotten about! So glad I downloaded it's!"
43484,"Pandora",2016-05-20,4,"Create a ""sound""   If you're not fussy about getting the exact song you want, Pandora's good. Thumbs up the songs you like. Thumbs down the songs you don't and they won't play them again. The more you vote, the better your station gets."
43485,"Pandora",2016-10-27,5,"Favorite artists   Great Radio even with ads. They're not long. You pick your favorite artists. What's better?!"
43493,"Pandora",2016-02-29,5,"Five Stars   App for my tablet"
43494,"Pandora",2017-09-30,4,"Great Music App   I had Pandora several years ago on my IPhone but since I no longer have one and I have an android now with not much memory, I loaded it to my Kindle.  I must say that I love the new format and am enjoying it a lot!!"

43508,"Pandora",2017-09-01,5,"I enjoy it.   I like how it can pick the music that I love to listen to."
43512,"Pandora",2016-03-01,5,"Great radio app   By clicking on one or two artists I have all my favorite music.  I can set the app to play while I go to sleep and to wake me up again the next morning.  I am watching much less TV now that I have my favorite music at my fingertips!"
43514,"Pandora",2012-04-03,5,"love it   love Pandora! free music without static or numerous commercials and the ones you do have you can skip fairly quickly"
43520,"Pandora",2017-10-03,4,"Need live help.   About Pandora; The music is fine but I can't seem to be able to sign up.  Changing a password is impossible."
43522,"Pandora",2016-02-11,5,"Pandora.   Love it. I buy it to avoid the ads. I'm very satisfied with Echo. The only problem I have is how echo doesn't hear me when music is playing. It has to be turned down low and then it can hear me. But that's a minor problem that I can live with."
43525,"Pandora",2016-02-16,5,"Great music app   I have iHeart on my phone, but I prefer Pandora. I love being able to make new stations based on artist, genre, or even song. We listen to Pandora on our Roku most every day. Now if we could all just agree on what station to put on!"
43534,"Pandora",2017-02-10,4,"Just downloaded this app and trying it for the first time   Don't know if its going to be good but my grandma had it for awhile and is able to download any music she wants so this might be better then any other music app I had. I just don't want to pay for anything lmao"
43536,"Pandora",2015-05-10,5,"I love this app   This i believe is my favorite app ever! The music selections are great and sound quality is awesome! I have selected about 25 of my favorite artists and with each artist you get other artists that compliment each other. And the shuffle option means i can listen all day and only hear my favorite performers!"
43537,"Pandora",2012-06-22,5,"Gotta Luv It!! Pandora: A Critical Review   This is by far one of the best mobile app's out there.I've been using Pandora daily and what's great about the mobile app (as opposed to the desktop version) is that there's no break in the playlist.  Sure, you have advertisements that pop up every few minutes but that's a small price to pay.  Everything else is great, great selection and ever-increasing song list and the ability to switch channels when I want to hear something else.  I don't particularly like ""mixing"" radio stations but that my preference and I can control that.Pandora radio for mobile.  5 stars."
43539,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"Great muaic all the time.   Love Pandora.  I can listen to anything I want to and mix it up.  Some days I listen to piano and classical.  Other days I listen to pop or retro plus many more stations."
43545,"Pandora",2015-01-06,5,"highly recommend   For main words: Three Dog Night Radio!!!Oh my goodness, I am loving this app! I can't get enough of it. The ads don't really bug me. They're reasonable in length and I find them more tolerable than the raunchy television commercials."
43546,"Pandora",2013-09-12,5,"I didnt use it because of the quality when your not subscribed, works amazing though   I prefer spotify and google all access or even mog. But since my subscriptions ran out and mog and all access is not on the app. I am using pandora for the first time. All though I don't want to use it because I don't have a subscription, so I just listen to 42 kbps or whatever the quality is for the song. The songs it plays are accurate, they are the songs I want to listen to. I love this app"
43547,"Pandora",2015-07-05,4,"Love Pandora!   We use Pandora all the time and have for years. Fantastic music service, creates play lists based on a favorite song, artist, genre. You can improve listening experience by personalizing tastes with ""likes"" and ""don't likes."" Would give 5 stars back before there were ads! :-)"
43548,"Pandora",2017-08-04,5,"Five Stars   Great app, one of the best sites around."
43550,"Pandora",2016-04-10,2,"Pandora doesn't play on my device   Right now it is stuck on buffering whenever I open the app.  I tried reinstalling but that didn't work either.  Please fix this or let me know what I can do.  Thanks."
43553,"Pandora",2017-07-24,4,"Pandora Radio   Didn't like all the commercials.. but other then that its awesome..."
43554,"Pandora",2015-04-18,3,"Okay, lack of selection and limited skipping makes this not very useful   For my listening genres (electronic new age/relaxation/concentration), the selection seems to be very thin and repetitive. Add to the limited skipping of unwanted selections, it was a no-brainer not to renew this after my year expired. I did discover Ulrich Strauss, for which I'll be eternally grateful :-)."
43555,"Pandora",2014-01-25,2,"Not worth getting   I have been a longtime Pandora One subscriber. Until recently, I have made the jump to Sirius XM satellite radio. Why? Much more variety. Not to mention 160+ live channels. All music channels can be catered to the end user's taste with MyXM it has 6 skips an hour limit, but doesn't make me feel bad. Because there is always something new to listen to. Pandora has become stale. If I Don't suggest a new artist the station keeps playing the same stuff over and over again. Sirius is worth the dough."
43558,"Pandora",2016-11-20,5,"Five Stars   It is great."
43559,"Pandora",2017-10-20,5,"I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from   I love the variety of Christian Gospel Music to select from. There is no cost to listen and enjoy unless you choose to upgrade. I like to be able to listen to a variety of Gospel music such as Country/Southern, Black Gospel and some more modern. It allows me to select, and then just run the shuffle of music to get the variety. Also I like to use it at school at times in my K2 class, using Christian Childrens music in our Christian school."

43603,"Pandora",2014-08-15,5,"Needed a pick me up!   It's AWESOME. Some of the secretary's at work would listen to Pandora on their computers. So I decided to download the app to my Kindle Fire. I needed a little pick me up the other day. I love listening to Chris Tomlin and some of the other Christian Artist's. What a blessing! I can carry the music with me from room to room, outside or in the car. That's why I've rated the app 5 stars."

43607,"Pandora",2015-06-04,5,"love, love, love Pandora   I grew up with radio and love the reduced advertising and great genres that can be created on Pandora.  I'm not really one to use ear buds since I'm an artist and need to be unencumbered when I'm working.  Just turn on the computer, plug in speakers and ""Bob's your uncle""!"
43611,"Pandora",2016-11-01,5,"Favorite Stations   My favorite stations are Miles Davis and Nora Jones."
43616,"Pandora",2017-07-24,5,"Five Stars   Awesome mix of music......"
43617,"Pandora",2014-02-14,4,"Great to use on my Kindle   I do love Pandora but do have an issue with them. I designed my own 'stations' and Pandora inserts music on my comedy station and vice versa (you get my drift..) so I have to hit the thumbs down sign each time.. Well, they keep doing this on all my 'stations'. I know I'm being picky but it does get annoying when 4+ times in a row I have to hit the thumbs down sign. We only get so many dislikes at a time.."
43619,"Pandora",2017-11-01,4,"Make it your own   I am so very addicted to Pandora. I only sometimes wish there were a few more skips allowed, but still a great thing all around ! I recommend thumbprint radio !"
43628,"Pandora",2013-01-23,5,"Pandora Is Fantastic   I've been a Pandora fan for years, and now, having it on my Kindle makes discovering and listening to music much easier. Pandora is such a great thing; I will always be a fan."

43646,"Pandora",2013-12-18,2,"Not for me..   I do not care for this one.I do not even understand why I would want to put all of my information online for someone else to see  and have not control over who sees it. I guess I am too private for this app. I believe it came with the Kindle as maybe some of the others on here for me to review that I do not remember downloading at all...I thank Amazon for the Free apps of the day!!!"

43654,"Pandora",2017-09-24,5,"Five Stars   Pandora is a great way to listen to my favorites and to find new favorites!"
43655,"Pandora",2013-09-27,4,"Keeps the music playing   I first started using Pandora on my laptop.  Having it loaded on my Android smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD is even better.  Able to play my stations in the kitchen the bedroom, the car and anywhere is fabulous.  The user interface is good and easy to figure out.  The only issue I have is that the touch buttons are so small on the screen it is hard to hit them accurately.  For example, the X that you use to close an advertisement and the menu to quit or change stations.  But other than that, it works like a charm.  I am a big fan of Pandora as a way to listen to music."
43660,"Pandora",2017-09-03,5,"Great music because you choose   Love it"
43664,"Pandora",2015-03-10,5,"Love my pandora   I love my Pandora. Such versatility, wide range of music selections. Love being able to customize stations and preferences. Also love being able to train my programs by giving tracks a thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't really listen to the radio anymore....just my iTunes and Pandora!"
43665,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Love it!   I drive an activities bus for the school district and the majority of the buses are retired route buses with broken, or more often, no radios. Pandora let's me use my Kindle, Iphone, and ipod to instantly stream the music I want to hear by my favorite artist. I often stream it on my ipod at home while I'm cleaning around the house. No more blaring stereo to hear your tunes around the house!!"
43666,"Pandora",2015-09-04,5,"Lovin' Pandora   Not a day goes by that I don't play my favorite artists on Pandora.  Whether on my Kindle, my cell or my laptop Pandora is always there playing what I enjoy listening to and not what someone else likes.  Even with the rare commercial breaks, its ok, because, it's RARE.  I LOVE MY PANDORA!"
43670,"Pandora",2014-10-08,3,"I like Pandora. Use it everyday   I like Pandora. Use it everyday. Not fond of the shuffle choices. I have multiple stations of different music interest, blues, ambient, country, rock n roll and so much more. Some days I am in the mood for country and would like to shuffle the music from my country stations. Some days I am a little bit country and rock n roll but not ambient or blues so I would like to shuffle just those."

43679,"Pandora",2016-05-24,4,"Love the amount of songs available in all music genres   Love the amount of songs available in all music genres.Hate that it takes forever to yea or nae your favorite songswhile setting up your favorite station."
43681,"Pandora",2017-08-10,1,"Play lists based on popularity rather than your personal taste.   Pandora sucks. Set up a ""station"" based on one of my favorite bands and played for two hours without actually playing a song by that band. Pandora also keeps trying to play music by bands I can't stand (guns and roses, ac-dc) because they are in the same genre as other music i like even though they are talentless."
43682,"Pandora",2016-02-12,5,"Portable Pandora!   Always loved Pandora on my desktop - so glad to not be tied down to one location. Love bringing Pandora from room to room or out on vacation, where I'm not familiar with the local radio stations."
43686,"Pandora",2016-08-01,5,"Love.   I love Pandora and always have, it's never crashed on me and it doesn't take as much data as all of the other music streaming apps."
43688,"Pandora",2014-06-10,4,"Pandora   I think it is wonderful to be able to access so many different types of music and even get a little background on the groups and see lyrics.  The only thing that's needed to make this 5 stars would be more relevant music choices when you choose an artist.  As an example I chose Beach Boys and the subsequent music will be a different style from the 50's."

They took my credit card information and it was my understanding that I would automatically continue to receive the premium version.  However, I went back to the free version and I was not even able to go on their website and activate the premium version.  I sent several emails to them and no-one resolved it or even attempted to see what happened.  In other words, they had a someone who wanted to be their customer but couldn't and still can't!""  Not the way to run a business."
43695,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"Five Stars   wonderful music"
43698,"Pandora",2015-06-26,5,"Great application   I really like having music on my Kindle.  It is only draw back is when you don't know the internet connection."
43708,"Pandora",2013-10-18,4,"Wonderful as usual   The new version of Pandora for Kindle Fire has many nice features like a sleep timer and an option to ask to temporarily not hear a tune you are tired of.I do wish it didn't require so many steps to exit the application and the mini-items to click are difficult for my visually impaired husband to see.Otherwise it is as wonderful as ever.  I definitely recommend the cheep annual subscription to avoid the commercials and have extended play for hours."
43713,"Pandora",2016-11-19,5,"Five Stars   Love it"
43714,"Pandora",2013-03-26,5,"Love the variety of this app!   Simply love this app. Am able to create stations based on my interests! I have run the gamut of stations; ie, favorite artists, showtunes, classical, oldies, musicals (contains music from productions, artists, Broadway; example: Momma Mia & Phantom), classical! Unbelievable that is a free app! Doesn't matter that one cannot specify songs as the offerings are so fantastic. Able to input opinion of songs through thumbs up/thumbs down. I have this on my Kindle Fire HD."
43718,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"Five Stars   I love Pandora, it's great to be able to listen to my favorite music at any time.I  lo"
43719,"Pandora",2013-09-17,5,"Awesome Music!   I LOVE Pandora! I like the fact that I create my own stations using my favorite artists as a guideline. Using the thumbs up and down I can control what artists get played more often and who never gets played again. I really have found myself turning off the television and listening to my favorite station because it has been customized for me and plays all good songs! You really can't loose!"

43733,"Pandora",2015-01-14,5,"What I enjoy in the evening with dinner.   I listen to Pandora daily when my wife and I are having dinner. I like the thumbs up or thumbs down feature because when I give it thumbs up I get more of that sort of music. When I give it a thumbs down the music goes off immediately. I also like the wide variety of music available."
43734,"Pandora",2017-03-09,4,"It is amazing🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎶   It Is amazing you type the name of the song you like and they give you a station and it shows you familiar arrest!!!!!!!!!!🎼🎶🎵🎸🎤"
43736,"Pandora",2014-03-14,5,"I love it   I love Pandora because it is like public radio, but you can choose what you like and if you don't like a song you can just skip it or dislike it and it skips the song and will not play the song again on the station you disliked it on. Ads aren't too often every 7 or so songs and after skips. If you hats ads you can always get Pandora one, which gives you additional skips, No ads, and on the website you can choose a custom background for $3.99 a month. One downside is I can't use the alarm clock feature because battery life on my kindle fire is really bad on wifi even on standby. I love the sleep time because sometimes I need something to turn off my music if I do fall asleep to help save me from being waken up to turn off the ""loud music"". I don't use the station shuffle much, but it is a cool feature which plays a different station after each song and you can go back to one station play by clicking the station you want."

43741,"Pandora",2017-07-19,4,"Nice good sounds !   Nice to be able to hear some of the old songs again, most of the radio stations don't really play 'oldies but goodies! Clue. It's not 1990's !"

43769,"Pandora",2012-11-03,5,"Love Pandora!!!!   Pandora is the most wonderful radio station because one is not bombarded by the type of music that is racket to the ears.  Simply select the artists you prefer and then Pandora selects similar music by other artists, in addition to the artists of your choice, to play.  There are no ridiculous ads to listen to between your favorite songs or radio announcers inanely gabbing to one another (although you will hear a 10 or 15 minute ad infrequently about Pandora).  If a song comes on you don't like, just hit skip and it will never be played again.  I listen for hours at a time and enjoy it very much, especially the price, free!!"

43791,"Pandora",2013-11-15,3,"Not that happy   It starts and stops at the weirdest times.  I'm all happy enjoying my music and then it will stop.  I'm not that happy about this.  Also, it keeps ""suggesting"" that I up grade, which means a monthly fee.  This maybe how they get you to upgrade, starting and stopping.  I am going to look into other media."
43793,"Pandora",2017-07-27,5,"Pick your own or play theirs   Love setting up my own likes and groups."
43800,"Pandora",2015-09-02,5,"A Great Investment   Free Pandora is awesome but you have commercials every Five or six songs. That's okay because it is free. You can pay and get no commercials. I've found some amazing bands that I would have never known existed. Thanks"

43811,"Pandora",2013-06-07,4,"Use it all the time   Its pretty great, but there were soooooo many commercials and adds.  I pushed through it, but THEN they limited the amount of time you can listen on mobile devices, and I drive all the time so at that point it was stop using it or pay the $3 a month... I upgraded, and its better now but its still very irritating that they always do this ""are you still listening"" nonsense.  My response is, ""NOT ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU JUST SHUT OFF MY MUSIC.""  I still use it constantly though so at the end of the day I suppose that should say something."
43815,"Pandora",2013-05-14,5,"If you want to hear your music you will love Pandora   Pandora is free if you don't mine once in a while a no irrating comercial. I love it. Plus you can tell them what you like and don't like with the thumbs up or thumbs down. Plus this app give you more that what is on your DVD player. It tell you information about the artist. I love my music and I have many different types I like to listen to. This Pandora app keeps up with all of my likes and dislikes. It is like my personal disk jocky without the mouth and chatty conversations."
43822,"Pandora",2017-06-12,5,"Finally. Some Pandora love.   Finally. Some Pandora love. Lets just hope Amazon keeps up with the updates. If theres one app that should be updated when need be, its this one."
43825,"Pandora",2014-06-29,4,"A must for music lovers   I love it when I can't sleep or want to hear new things.  I use Pandora mostly on my Kindle and never on my phone.  It is miraculous how you can tailor a station to what you want to hear and are exposed to like music.  I have a lot of music downloaded to my Kindle, but use Pandora when I have a wi-fi connection."
43827,"Pandora",2017-08-20,4,"Four Stars   Good streams and variety of music!"
43831,"Pandora",2015-11-06,5,"Free-Music-Streaming   Absolutely amazing online music streaming app. Great variety with an exceptional ability to customize each specific playlist. Also has a great ability to suggest songs that you wouldn't normally listen to, but are a similar type of music as the playlist you're listening to."
43833,"Pandora",2013-01-20,5,"I don't know how I lived without it   Pandora makes listening to music such a pleasure. It isn't perfect, occasionally it will skip forward in the middle of a song I like and it can be repetitive with songs but once you start listening to it you can barely stand commercial radio. Unlike satellite radio you can set a station with any artist or song you want and a year subscription costs nearly the same as a month of satellite or you can get the free version and listen to their occasional annoying commercials. There is no talk or sports radio on Pandora but I love being able to choose the stations by songs or artists I like. You can also bookmark songs you like and buy them on iTunes which is convenient. They also tell you why they choose to play a certain artist on a station you choose although I don’t find their choices always make sense. For example I made a Coldplay station and it kept playing big band music particularly Bing Crosby. They gave some convoluted reason about percussions and rhythms but if you eant to listen to Coldplay you don't want to listen to song after song of big band music. And it would literally play song after song of big band music, I found this very strange. I resolved the issue by choosing a Coldplay song I like and making a station from that instead. Now I hear the music I’m interested in listening to from Coldplay and bands who actually have a similar style. The thumbs up/down feature rocks and so does the skip. For $36 a year you can’t beat it. Music you (mostly) love and no commercials. My husband listens to commercial radio a lot and he is constantly singing radio ad jingles without even realizing he’s doing it and it drives me nuts!"
43835,"Pandora",2017-07-24,5,"Great way to listen to mysic   I just love pandora."
43836,"Pandora",2015-08-02,2,"Great Station if you Like South American Music besides American Music.   Being from Europe I was disappointed,  Spotify Music App. Has every music you will love, from every country.  Pandora is for not for a European  American, like me. I like different stations, I do listen to American Music,  Pandora has also South American Music, which is not for me."

I usually like the song selections and have always been impressed by how well the songs seem to connect to one another."
43851,"Pandora",2017-07-25,5,"Should have gotten app. sooner!!   Great app!!  Wish I had downloaded this months ago... We have this at my work and I love it!  Why did I wait so long to get it for myself!?"
43852,"Pandora",2013-03-17,2,"Don't bother with phone app!!!  Read below for a great desktop trick.   Used to be the shizzle for the phone.  Now they have so many ads streaming through that it will actually slow down and interrupt the song stream.  WTF?  And to boot, they're now asking you pay after 40 hrs every month.  I used to play it in the car, at work, bike riding, etc.  40 hrs is a few days for me.As far as the mobile app goes, screw Pandora with their 40 hr limit and endless ads.  You have far too much competition for this crap!Now, for the pc review.  On the pc you don't experience the above issues however, there's still a lot of ads.  UNLESS . . .  you know a trick, like I do.  And yes, it's completely legal.For your home pc, Google ""Adam Haile Elpis"".  Click on the first hit.  Here, you can download Elpis which, is a free desktop client for Pandora.  In other words, it is a program designed to play Pandora.  Nifty thing is that it does two amazing things.  1- it allows you to have unlimited skips.  2- it will not download any ads.  In other words, it simulates the pay service.YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"
43865,"Pandora",2013-12-11,5,"Pandora for your Kindle!!!!   I mean, it's Pandora Radio...on your Kindle. What else do I need to say? It works just like the mobile app. Ok the one thing that comes to mind is that to close the app, you have to pretty much go to your Home Page and then hit the more options button on the top right corner and tap ""Quit"". If you tap the Home button, it continues to play in the background. No big deal, and its a little weird to me probably because I've only had the Kindle for a little over a month."
43867,"Pandora",2016-11-09,5,"Great Music Selection   Great music selection.  Totally recommend this."
43871,"Pandora",2016-02-02,4,"The interface was obviously intended for a larger screen than ...   The interface was obviously intended for a larger screen than the standard ""Fire"" tablet, so some of the buttons are a little too small.  Otherwise it works exactly as you'd expect."
43875,"Pandora",2017-06-12,1,"Doesn't work   Too bad I can't give 0 stars because zero use is how much this is worth.  Won't open, just says experiencing technical problems every time I try to sign in.  Deleted it."

43878,"Pandora",2016-10-29,3,"Make it great again   After the update.. I can't skip songs anymore. When I watch the vids for skips they still don't come. Make this app great again by not touching features that don't need touching! And the ads are worse! I don't mind the commercials since this app is free but take away the ads! They are in the way!"
43879,"Pandora",2017-10-17,5,"Five Stars   Luv it!!!"
43883,"Pandora",2016-03-05,3,"A little buggy   Maybe it is just the kindles we have? But it is a little buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That said we are big Pandora fans and we use Pandora on all our devices. Just wish it worked better on the kindles"
43887,"Pandora",2013-03-29,5,"Stellar app!   What can a person say about a music service that customizes one's listening taste into an intuitive music playback service?  It's great and worth having, unless  you're someone who likes to play the same personal collection of mp3's over and over again.  Pandora allows its fans to add variety by accepting or rejecting tunes according to one's taste in music.  In the end, you get a music channel personalized to YOU!  How good is that!?"
43889,"Pandora",2017-08-22,5,"great! ability to change music to match my mood ...   great !  ability to change music to match my mood when ever I want."
43894,"Pandora",2015-11-17,4,"Pandora at it's best!!!!   I enjoy getting on Pandora. It allows me to explore different types of music and develop my own playlist. It allows me to sit back and listen to a group I might have overlooked previously so then I can go from there and experience different groups that are somewhat alike. I just don't like the ""ads interruption"

43902,"Pandora",2014-05-10,5,"loving Pandora   I received head phones for Mother's Day along with a suggestion for Pandora.  I now live with phones on my head almost all day long.  We have become so accustomed to TV, the computer and today's technology ""stuff"" .. I had almost forgotten the shear joy of LISTENING to music and actually HEARING the WORDS of the songs.  With Pandora I can choose what I want to listen to ..it's truly wonderful."
43904,"Pandora",2013-10-18,4,"Fun Radio is here!   I got this so I could integrate my smart TV with my android tablet and use my tablet as a remote for the radio, and it does exactly what it is supposed to.  I particularly enjoy being able to put in the artist or song and up it pops, though I get bored pretty quickly when the same type of music keeps coming.  Still, it's a must have for those who enjoy 'listening' to radio!"

I'm tired of it trying to play genres of music that absolutely don't belong in the channels I create.  Overpriced app that tends to play music you don't like.  Play quality is good."

But a lot of the times it will freeze or I've also encountered issues where it doesn't fully play the song and skips to the next. AND THE BUFFERING! Forget it! I will have a perfect connection and this will still occur. The ads also freeze up the program, too, I feel. Hopefully they will come out with an update that fixes this, unless it's just an error I'm receiving with my LG Optimus S."

If you're trying to go back and discover the last track you listened to instead of swiping back you have to turn the kindle on its side and push the arrow button...not intuitive, not easily discovered unless you do it on accident.Why is the app do boring and blocky looking? The iOS Pandora app is far more attractive, why not give the kindle the same sort of sleek offerings instead of something that looks like an afterthought?The kindle fire he app store has been so disappointing in general."
44030,"Pandora",2014-11-29,4,"Pretty Cool Stuff. But...   Pandora is amazing but sometimes  the person your interested in, in music of course the he/she s music wanders off somewhere else.

44215,"Pandora",2015-01-30,4,"Good, but not great   The free music portion is great and the app has few to little glitches, but the app isn't quite at the quality of some of its competitors. They need to offer more choice music rather than suggested music, or just music of similar nature to what I requested. Between this and spotify, I choose spotify, but this is still an app worth getting."

It loads really smoothly on my kindle and I love how u can read,play other apps etc. While listening to your music. I know u can't exactly choose the song u want to listen to but it helps for me to discover other music that I might like. U can also skip a songs if u don't like the one playing."
44235,"Pandora",2015-08-18,5,"bug?   I have used this app for years and I have always loved it! For some reason this app has not worked this past week. Songs will attempt to load and then a commercial will come on. I can't get any music to play. What's the issue?"
44237,"Pandora",2016-03-02,3,"That sucked!   Doesn't play in the Turks and Caicos Islands. That sucked!"

I have now struggled with the new set up.  Many times it is not functioning and it is very difficult to navigate through it, just try to delete a station from ""my stations"" and you will see what I mean."
44241,"Pandora",2013-02-10,5,"Fantastic!   Anytime I can listen to music while I'm doing something is fabulous.  Now I have the choice of my phone or my kindle!  My computer speakers do not work so now that I have this app, I can take the music from room to room and not have to mess with turning it off on my phone or turn it down & then up again or off & on on my phone.  Makes life so much simpler."

I would buy it if it was five dollars. that's how good it is. AMAZINGNESSSSSSSS!"

44326,"Pandora",2017-10-21,1,"BOOOO on Pandora   get this. pandora fades out songs at any point in a song to put in a commercial. most of them are to upgrade pandora. the rest are local area companies, which in my area is about 4 companies so every 10 min, i get to hear the same commercials. booooo on you pandora. the commercials on the screen where just fine and with all the free music options out there lets be honest, Pandora showed itself to be a fail. deleted and dismissed."

Really disappointed. Really liked this app. Used it all the time..."
44336,"Pandora",2012-07-12,3,"Not Customer Friendly   My Pandora was working wonderfully for awhile. I constantly heard a song that I had ""thumbed up"" so I decided to ""thumb down"" it. It skipped and within half and hour I heard the song AGAIN. If you thumb down a song its supposed to never show back up. Also, it seems that there is a limited amount of thumbed up songs you can have. My biggest complaint is that the app signed me up for the free trial of Pandora One without my permission.  I wasnt going to use the free trial until commercials and all the things Pandora One gets rid of really started to annoy me. This app is slow on my phone (Motorola Defy) and drain my battery on it and my kindle fire. I have to listen to music to go to sleep to block out noises (I use earbuds too), so I truly have no other choice."

I was switching back and for from this to Songza, because was stopping my service after 30 days of listening, and cutting me short, I guess because I listened to it too much, without signing up, but I think that has been discontinued, now Pandora is my #1 .....thanks Pandora, and I will be signing up for commercial-free listening soon"

44399,"Pandora",2013-06-07,5,"Joe reviews another one   This is the best music app as far as radio is considered. There are very little adds and you can listen to anything you like. Lets say you like Queen, The Beatles, or Insane Clown Posse. Type the name of any band in, and you can listen to that band and other bands like the band you typed in. If you listen to ICP expect to hear Boondox, Twiztid, Cypress Hill, and much more. For another instant if you listen to The Beatles, expect to get Beach Boys, the Byrds, Dave clarck 5 and many more 60's bands. Last example is Queen. On the Queen station expect to hear, Boston, Adam and the ants, Electric Light Orchestra, and more great 70-80's bands."
44403,"Pandora",2015-08-28,1,"worst.   a zero if i could write it.  They don't seem to take into account what i like and don't like. Also, there are song lists for certain subsets of out population but not for others.. For example ""dinner with ladies of song"" but there is not a male version.  the CEO is on the liberal New York Times board and I have no doubt this affects his judgement.  Stay away and go to Songza or another site."
44412,"Pandora",2016-09-04,4,"music review   very enjoyable I like being able to select the music that I love and so many artists to select from thank you Pandora."
44417,"Pandora",2014-11-01,2,"Pandora   Pandora is a great concept looks easy to use. It downloads and opens quickly on my Nokia phone . But then  Pandora does not work. I get the Pandora logo with a  message stating it is having trouble  playing  my next selection. The low rating is more for the lack of diagnostics than the app itself. I cant rate the app because I can't get into it !!"

44420,"Pandora",2012-11-17,5,"Its awesome   The pp just got an update that really helped smooth out a few problems or limitatikns in had, but its still got a few. Can always build a better mouse trap and all that jazz. Havent had any problems with it just not playing lile other have said. Its also awesome in the fact that it will play even when you hit the sleep button on the kindle fire hd, so you dont have to burn that baterry so much to listen to music."
44422,"Pandora",2017-02-07,5,"Five Stars   very good apps"
44429,"Pandora",2014-01-31,5,"Music lovers library   Pandora is a wonderful way to hear the music YOU like. Whether it be a particular style or by a particular artist. It even gives you other music ""similar"" to the favorites you pick. You can set your IPad up in any room where you might be working or lounging and with a couple of clicks you have all the music you most enjoy playing for hours or just a few minutes if that is your choice. Great Stuff!"
44432,"Pandora",2014-01-06,4,"Pandora helps expand my musical awareness and access   One of the things I love most about Pandora is how one artist leads to another, introducing me to music and musicians.  The fact that I can access it anywhere has helped me make it through road trips in the car and spinning at the gym. I only wish their play list for some of my favorite artists was longer/deeper. That is a serious limitation that I hope their growth will enable them to gradually overcome."
44434,"Pandora",2014-06-21,4,"A Captain's Duty....   I enjoyed reading the book. Got it right after seeing the movie, Captain Phillips.  I actually enjoyed the movie more because of Tom Hank's acting (last 20 minutes of film was tremendous).  Books give a little more detail, but in this case I didn't miss out by just seeing the movie.  However, the book was worth reading."
44445,"Pandora",2016-03-19,5,"AWESOME   It is the best app ever since I was born"
44452,"Pandora",2016-12-07,4,"Would of been a 5 star but....   Okay. first this is a great app to have. I loved it when I was living in the USA. But now I am living in France and the app does not work here.  I miss mu music that I used to listen to.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix it to were I can listen to Pandora's music again."
44458,"Pandora",2013-03-26,5,"love it!   i love this app!  but only the paid version.  the ads in the free version are annoying beyond words.i like how you can customize your playlists, discover new artists in genre you like.i haven't listened to the radio in years because i'm sick of commercials and how they beat all songs deadby repeating them every 3 songs.  so discovering new artists and music is now done with Pandora.i do wish they would allow you to skip an unlimited amount of tracks, esp when your a paid member.it doesn't seem fair to force you to listen to songs you dislike or are not in the mood for.i highly recommend Pandora!"
44459,"Pandora",2015-07-25,5,"I love Pandora!   I love Pandora!! It allows me the chance to pick the music style I want to listen to and make a channel that plays similar music. I find new artists that I had never heard of before everyday. If I don't like a song they are playing all I have to do is give it a thumbs down and it disappears from the playlist. I have channels I pick to clean house by, dance to, and just hang out to. Love Pandora!"
44461,"Pandora",2015-08-07,1,"tlarson1656   Pandora worked great until yesterday. None of my stations are available on my kindle fire HD. I had the same problem on my iPhone, but that is now fixed. When will it be fixed for the kindle?"

44464,"Pandora",2013-07-24,5,"Wonderful   It's great that Amazon has the Pandora app for the Kindle and Androids.  Getting it from other sources means you can get modified code.  So far I haven't found any Amazon apps that have been bloated or modified."

44483,"Pandora",2014-01-10,5,"Awesome!   The world sure has changed. I wish this stuff had been around when  was a kid. Remember all those dang cassette tapes and later CDs we lugged around? This app is a a straight up free juke box."
44489,"Pandora",2017-01-11,5,"Thumbs up for Pandora   Pandora gets me through my work day. I love the variety of music.  Christian rock is my favorite I like the fact that its free."
44490,"Pandora",2017-10-17,5,"Great Music on Pandora   I get all my music varieties without any hassle.  Listened to songs I have not heard in years."
44502,"Pandora",2014-01-18,5,"Pandora   I chose 5 stars because Pandora provides free music. They have any artists you'd like to listen to and when you create a station you're able to add another artist to play on that same station. You can also like or dislike any song which helps Pandora know what you like. However, if you don't like commercials, then you need to purchase Pandora which I believe is very cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music."
44505,"Pandora",2017-06-29,5,"my opinion   I hare that it is not working for me but it really is a good app that you guys made it has some really good music"

My dogs like having it as well.I connect it to my stereo for a quick streaming experience.  I used to play it on my iPhone, but then used my fire so i won't need to disconnect every time i got a phone call.The main problem is that the app will stop playing when there is a Ad.  This happens less frwequently with PandoraOne, but still happens each 30 - 40 minutes.  A hassle since i need to turn off the app and then re-launch it.Not sure why this still not fixed."

44539,"Pandora",2017-07-22,1,"All about those ads, (about those ads) no music   So when I downloaded this app, I found that it's conveniently possible to have it play in the background, on your phone.  I didn't mind the idea of watching ads, because it's a free app and I know they have to stay afloat somehow.  But if you ask for music from a certain band, it will give you a 1/6 chance of hearing that band, a 2/6 chance of hearing a similar band, and a 1/2 chance of hearing a band that is nothing like what you asked for.  But that's not all; the graphic ads pop up randomly, overtop 3/4 of your playlist navigation, which often causes any attempt to navigate away from unwanted music, to send you to another ad.  I wish the annoyance ended there, but for every minute of music you're given, willingly or not, it gives you a minute and a half of pop-up video ads as well.  Trying to flip to another song only results in it informing you that you're not allowed to skip songs, if you try more than 3 times an hour, and forget useful buttons like ""rewind""; if you try to tap the track to hear something again, it only puts a "" like/dislike"" on the track.  I was unlucky enough that my attempt to hear ten seconds over again, MARKED THE TRACK TO NEVER PLAY AGAIN, and my attempt to change the thumbs down mark to a thumbs up, when clicking the previously listed song, put a like on its album, didn't take the dislike off the song, and also glitched to put a like on the current song that I didn't want to be hearing.  In essence, I wasted twice as much time listening to ads and songs I didn't want to hear, than hearing music I actually wanted, AND I gave these twits my e-mail for that lovely opportunity."

I got email asking for 6 month trial for the top of the line super duper (where when you ask for a song, you actually get that song) - and it doesn't work that way on my lap top, and it didn't convert to my phone/tablet - I now get advertisements for the same thing there.  How many $9.99's do they want from me?"

44619,"Pandora",2013-08-22,4,"you start off loving it...   You start off loving it and the world looks beautiful, but then it starts messing up. It will stop mid song and move on another, or it will just stop playing and you have exit and start again. I could tolerate it if these instances were few and far between, but they're not, and once they start happening they keep happening.That's not to say you shouldn't use it, because let's face it for free music listening it's pretty much your only option, but know that you are at some point going to be yelling at your phone over it."
44621,"Pandora",2017-06-02,5,"Five Stars   Great for a free app, repeats songs more often than expected but all in all pretty good."

I created a couple of station and it's amazing how it plays the songs I want to hear.Just make sure to 'like' the songs you want while they are playing and with time the station will be very accurate playing the songs related to that station."

44633,"Pandora",2013-10-25,3,"Great at Sticking to Genre but Too Many Commercials   I've switched over to iTunes Radio for the most part but still use Pandora for the kids on the morning drive to school. Pandora does the best job at sticking to your specific genre selection (kids, halloween, 4th of July) than any other streaming service out there. Great job but too many commercials for me to use as my main streaming station."

I had no problem playing it for a couple hours after downloading it. However when I tried to close the program nothing worked except a hard shutdown. When I tried to restart program nothing worked.  Very, very disappointed!! Other programs on Kindle worked. Everything BUT Pandora...what's up?"
44669,"Pandora",2013-05-27,3,"Music in my kitchen   I've been taking my Kindle into the kitchen when I preparing meals and doing dishes. Nice to enjoy music while I work but it seems to cut out and there is a lot of dead air space."

I love it you can listen to any music you want andbits fast and easy but the one thing I hate about it is that you have to have wifi and I have wifi at my grandma's but not at m yt?

44692,"Pandora",2014-04-25,5,"Personal heart-warming radio station   Pandora is fabulous for anyone who loves music. The novel idea is that we control every piece we hear.  By choosing the artist, or title of the piece we enjoy, (or group of artists) - we are then gifted with our choices and also other pieces in the same genre.  Additionally we can choose to shuffle through our entire list or stay with one choice, whatever our  mood. I would encourage everyone to experience this for themselves.  Best of all it's free."

44715,"Pandora",2014-06-06,3,"I am not to pleased.   When I first got this app I was happy with it. I had all the stations I wanted and it was easy to navigate. Then after about three months it came up with a update that required you to have sign in. I tried it, it worked, I got in and was happy. Then the next day I tried to sign in with the same password and sign in but it said there was a sign in all ready existing to that password."

While I have an existing accout with them, I like to have the choice as to whether or not I include them in my day to day life.

I'll put it on the nearest sound system quite frequently, and the most recent download, the one for my Samsung Galaxy IV lets me plug into the radio on my truck and play quite good audio on the go.  So far, this has not made a big dent in my monthly allotment of gigabytes of download over Verizon, in part because most of the time I use it on devices attached to my home network either via Ethernet or wirelessly that are served by high speed cable based internet service."

I have become very disappointed with this app because of a constant loading issue.  It will work a couple of times then it won't load.  I've deleted/downloaded this app so many times it's becoming a chore.  Please fix this!  Don't make me go back to iheart radio!"
44750,"Pandora",2014-02-07,5,"A great value of entertainment and serendipitous listening joy.   Pandora is a joy to use and an incredible value for free (with ads) or for a small monthly fee (ad-free). I love that I can create multiple ""stations"", specify a few artists to ""focus"" the programming, and just sit back and enjoy the surprising and almost always spot-on results. A refreshing change from my downloaded albums, annoying commercial radio, and horribly repetitive satellite broadcast options.  Love Pandora!  Thank you.  Pandora."

44765,"Pandora",2014-01-24,5,"love it   love all the music, the artist, and such on this app! you can listen to pretty much anything you want! love it"

44767,"Pandora",2015-10-29,5,"Love this App   I have a couple of stations created off of some of my favorite artists. EVERY song on there is incredible - takes me back many years and I can listen to it endlessly. Quality of the songs is excellent, and when compared to other music streaming apps such as Slacker Radio, Pandora is without peer."
44772,"Pandora",2016-12-09,4,"I love pandora and use it all the time but they ...   I love pandora and use it all the time but they need a larger variety of music on each station. I know exactly what songs I am going to hear any time I go in."
44776,"Pandora",2014-01-12,5,"Free Fabulous Music, Your Way!   Love Pandora! It let's me create my own music stations, jazz one minute Christian music the next.  And what's cool about it is if you ""like"" the song by pressing the thumbs up icon, the next time you choose that station they will play your favorites, so pretty much guaranteed to hear your favorites in that time frame.I have the free standard version, and that's good enough for me, I don't mind the occasional short ads, I highly recommend!"

44797,"Pandora",2012-08-06,3,"ads ruin it.   I don't really mind there being ads but some of them are about sexual enhancement etc. I don't want to be seeing/hearing those certain ads with my family around. the worst part is those types of ads you get while the music is playing, you cant close them! the close button simply does not work and opens the link as if you'd clicked on the ad itself. I understand I'm using the free version of Pandora but there should be a way to disable those types of ads while still being able to listen to my favorite songs that have slight profanity in them. other than that, good app."
44799,"Pandora",2014-01-23,5,"Works Well   I use and like Pandora and am a paid subscriber; really like accessing it on the Fire and plugging into external powered speakers or my hi-fi. Initially I found this app to be annoyingly unstable: If I tried to log into my Pandora account when first turning on the Fire, I could usually get in but sometimes it timed out before I could complete the login process or I'd get a message telling me they're experiencing problems. Anyway, there must have been an update at some point because the app has been trouble free for quite a while now and I really like it. I particularly like that there's a ""quit"" option when I want to stop it, as opposed to completely logging out. After using the ""quit"" option, when I want to get back in all I have to do is select Pandora from the Fire carousel and the app launches with no need to sign in. The alarm clock function is probably my favorite thing; very cool to wake to your own programmed music channel. Good stuff!"
44803,"Pandora",2014-07-11,5,"Pandora is the wise old man of music streaming   I have been using Pandora since pretty close to when it first came out for PC.  I got Pandora one a few years later...back then it was one of the only apps that did music streaming in the way it does, but even with newer services available from other companies.  I still use Pandora . Love it"
44815,"Pandora",2015-09-20,3,"I love pandora but.....   When I downloaded this app, I thought it would be fun. But everytime is says I have to make an account to listen, it will not let me. And I have tried this every day for the past two months. So I deleted this app."

44821,"Pandora",2017-09-18,5,"Pandora praise.   We absolutely love Pandora.  It is great while reading, talking in the living room with family and friends and just to relax. A good tension reliever. Oh yes, enjoyable music with good choices of performers."
44823,"Pandora",2017-09-26,4,"Pandora   Easy selection, decent collection.  I would like some more songs because occasionally there is repetition."
44828,"Pandora",2014-10-29,1,"Such a let down. ..not the service...just the licenses.   I can't believe they let me download this app when it isn't even available in the UK. As soon as I opened it it has a warnine screen saying it is not available in the UK. And I LOVE Pandora don't get me wrong. But it was a big letdown after getting my hopes up that I would finally be able to get Pandora in the UK. Total bummer."
44829,"Pandora",2014-12-27,5,"There really is a free lunch (of music).   Utterly incredible I can get all the music in all the genres for free. How come now one ever told me this before.. no more messing around with iTunes or cranky ipod down load... its on my computer and even better on my kindle. Easy app to get.. did nor need SS#, blood type name of first grade teacher or prom date top get... Stunning, amazing, I love it"
44831,"Pandora",2017-02-19,5,"Main Problem......now fixed!   I really enjoy Pandora, daily, with all my favorite radio stations.  I love the Shuffle feature!  My biggest complaint is that it pops on at any time without clicking on it. This problem only happens on my Kindle Fire HD 8, which I have to Shut Down when I leave because Pandora may come on and use up all the battery. I do not sign out to end the music, only ""Quit"" because it's very difficult to sign in.  I don't know if this is a Pandora problem or a Kindle problem.Update  4-16-17: After the recent Pandora update, this problem has finally been fixed!  Much improvement with this last update, too."
44833,"Pandora",2014-04-19,4,"LOVE!!   It would be nice if you could pick your specific song list like grooveshark but it's still an AWESOME alternative to commercial radio!"

44837,"Pandora",2011-11-19,5,"Be a sport and spring for the premium account.   I've been reading waaay too many whines from kids who don't like the commercials. THERE'S AN ANSWER, CHEAPOS. Pay a piddling amount for a year of commercial-free Pandora and help the company stay afloat. You'll also get a great-quality stream. The only reason that Slacker may hags fewer ads is that (a)  they can't find the advertisers and (b) they haven't burned through their capital yet. Meanwhile, NOBODY beats Pandora's Music Genome algorhythm at sussing out new music you'll love. They're easily best in breed. FIVE STARS. Try it and if you love it but hate the ads, pay the piper. You won't be sorry."

44855,"Pandora",2014-02-16,1,"Pandora   I had Pandora on my Ipod but when I went to put it on my kindle it asked for my password.  I wasn't sure if I had had a separate pass word for Pandora.  Was it my password for Amazon? This was confusing so they did not load it onto my kindle however they seem to think it is on. I am not sure how to go about getting it now. I do like Pandora on my Ipod"

44863,"Pandora",2012-01-07,4,"great app, odd skipping problem   this app does its job: delivers the Pandora experience on kindle fire.  free tunes customized the say you like without having to micromanage your playlist.i sympathize with other commenters who complain about the ads,  but I really cant get upset about that for free music.  would be nice to have greater variety in them so I didn't hear the same REI ad twenty times an hour.one issue... every few songs, it has a tendency to pause for a couple seconds in silence, as though the buffer hasn't caught up.  hopefully they'll fix this with an update.  but for this, would give five stars."

44892,"Pandora",2015-04-22,4,"Great app   I love this app, I love that you can change channels and search for channels that is great because you can listen to different artists and music.

I can listen on my own time with my 'own' stations which I have created.I travel and love not being dependent on  a sound system anywhere.

44914,"Pandora",2017-09-12,5,"Like it a lot!!   Love being to choose the genres and artists that I like to hear.  Also like the ability to change song, if it's one I don't care for."

Listening to music on Pandora has helped me block out the distractions and focus on my work. Great selection of music and ability to customize your stations. The only issue is that it eats up a lot of bandwidth on my phone if I am not on wifi...just need to make sure your device is on wifi."

Well one day, I got a message saying that I had exceeded my limit of 40 hours that month. It said if I would just pay $.99 I could listen for the rest of the month for free. Since I loved it so much I took the offer. I then proceeded to leave the app after it said I had successfully purchased my rest of the month. When I came back later that day, it gave me the same message. I figure it just didn't register the first time so I went and checked my acount. When I looked Pandora did take the $.99 from me but didn't register it. Being annoyed I just paid again. Then I was listening to my music and it kept skipping songs. My mother told me to uninstall it and then reinstall it. So I uninstalled it. When I went to reinstall, it kept failing. So that means I lost $2 to Pandora. I know it's not much, but when I only get a gift card of $25 for my kindle on gift giving holidays, it makes me a bit frustrated. I want my money back! How do I ask for it back?"

44975,"Pandora",2014-03-04,5,"Great Tribute of A wonderful variety of Music   It took awhile to figure out the ins and outs of operating this app but I do love it now and it was not hard to figure it all out. These Entertainers can really cut a rug on videos and albums but some of them need more experience to entertain live shows. Don't get me wrong but they need better instruments also and lots of ORIGINAL RIFFS to grab that Brass Ring.I wish all of our musicians  the very best..."

I can choose jazz, classical, classic rock and roll, gospel, or any type I want. Or, I can choose anyone from Michael Buble to Arrowsmith! It's a wonderful place to escape or have as a companion while working at the computer."
44985,"Pandora",2017-01-20,5,"Pretty necessary for your Fire   I'm a music junkie so this was a no brainer for an app to add to my Fire tablet. It gives me the variety between the Prime music and Pandora stations. I bluetooth the audio to a Motorola Sol speaker."
44988,"Pandora",2016-03-01,4,"too much to get in   What's with all the steps to listen to the music? Before it was one quick step. Now it's like I have to sign up every time I want to listen. Sometimes that's too hard to do while I'm driving. HATE IT!!"

Because pandora is epic, and knows what you like, and how you want it served.Pandora creates radio stations around suggestions (band name/song) that you give it. It's awesome, and super customizable.

45017,"Pandora",2013-07-31,4,"Great App   I have this on my phone and my kindle and Pandora is really useful. It sometimes limits the amount of songs you can skip, which is unfortunate since sometimes you have to listen to songs you don't like, and there are ads, but the app itself is really helpful.It's great to have one specific genre and for the music to stay on that track. I really enjoy the app."

I Love This App!I'm Listining To It As I Write This Review:)It Gives You Free Music:)It Does Not Give You What You Want To Listin To Whenyou make a station...It gives you a song that's like it...I kinda like that though, gives you more choices to makewith your amazon card or itunes card.overall.... great app!!!"
45055,"Pandora",2011-12-05,5,"Great for the car   I downloaded this app 6 months ago on my Droid X and recently on my Droid X 2. Both times, I've enjoyed plugging in my phone with an audio jack into my car and surfing my stations. It sucks up battery pretty fast, so I also charge my phone in the car while listening to Pandora. And it only works if you have wifi or 3G available which isn't an issue unless you're driving far out in the countryside.I recommend this app and want to mention that I haven't had songs skip or not fully play.If I will, I'll update this review."
45057,"Pandora",2015-08-17,5,"great app   I am 12. And I think that this app is the best app I have on my kindle. I believe there is literally only one flaw: Not everybody has it!!! Once again, I totally love this app. Five stars from me. ♥♥♥♥♥"

45072,"Pandora",2014-05-28,5,"cool app   I really like this app, and it is nice because if the device turns off, you can still listen to the music. You can make a new radio by entering the artist or song and the radio will play songs similar to the one that you typed in and made a station. Hope the review was helpful and look for my other review for covet fashion! Peace Out!"
45074,"Pandora",2017-01-18,5,"Variety and navigable.   I enjoy the variety of artists and music. Depending on the venue and activity my music tastes vary. The app is easy to navigate."
45078,"Pandora",2011-11-16,2,"Ads suck and the interface is difficult with them running.   What a pain in the butt. You get some type of advert almost any time you perform an action. For example, you click to view an artists details, you go back to the song, there is an ad. The ad sizes vary in size and the 'x' to close them out is very tiny so what happens is you go to close an ad, for the fifth time in one track, and you end up launching the browser and getting hit with the ad. Screw it, I will keep forking over the cash for rhapsody.Adding to the review. These ads are worse than a porn site."

45092,"Pandora",2015-02-09,3,"Ok...   It is a good app, for the most part, but it has some problems. For starters, the ads. A few times, it played an ad in the middle of a song! Also, it is possible to taylor the station to play what you want, but once you do, it is stuck that way! Even if you delete the thumbs up and down, the radio is still not very diverse. Also, it doesn't have that much music, and it gets albums on very slowly.All in all, three stars, for problems."

45102,"Pandora",2012-07-12,4,"Love it but...   Don't get me wrong I love the fact that they play great music for no price at all. Its really great that you do t have to go and buy your music for $ 1.00 but I think that they should update it because it plays songs twice after hitting the thumbs down button but at the same time I like to make sure that I don't want to hear that song. I also do t like that you have minnimum of 6 skips and that the commercials are pointless and stupid, I give it 2 thumbs up!:)"
45103,"Pandora",2013-09-25,2,"Fallacy of the Music Genome Project   The free version of Pandora plays music at 128K, which is only good for people who have very low standards in audio quality. Pandora One has 192K sound, but the quality is nowhere near iTunes Radio. The game is over for Pandora. Apple is choosing people who are pillars of music to choose their own playlists, and the lack of crappy songs that comes with Pandora is but a memory."

The music comes in a variety of genres most  of which I haven't had time to explore.  You can save favorite tracks, search by artist, track or song.  I still need to spend more time learning how to use it. But I'm very pleased so far."
45134,"Pandora",2015-05-03,3,"Not keeping up with competition   I like Amazon Prime radio better. Amazon allows you to repeat a song, advance to a later part of the song, shows the lyrics (Pandora dropped this feature from mobile), and has free downloads of some songs. Creating playlists also a big plus."

But now I turn Pandora on, and the option to zoom out to view bios, lyrics, and how the song relates to your selection is gone. What the heck? That means that I also can't go back and view songs that I liked but didn't catch the name of I. time. Not cool.~Kindle Fire?"
45299,"Pandora",2014-02-03,3,"Love it but...   I Absolutely adore Pandora and use it all the time for my music. The only thing that is wrong is I would very much like to use the new alarm clock feature, where it starts playing music when you need to get or ect. I've only got it to work the first time I used it. After that it won't turn on. Will give five stars when this is fixed."
45301,"Pandora",2012-07-05,4,"musical   this app is musical because I can choose any song I would like to choose but there is two reasons I hate about Pandora number one is that sometimes after a song goes of they have commercials and its like really and the second thing I hate about Pandora is that after you skip like six songs they tell you to stop well we don't like some of these songs but other wise that I still thank the game is musical"
45306,"Pandora",2013-05-28,4,"Pandora's ups and downs   Pandora allows you to listen to a variety of music (you name it!!!). It is great to listen to whole working or being occupied. It does not always play the songs you want even if you 'like' them. It only allows you six skips per hour and gives you a certain # of hours to listen for a month. Every month is renewed. If you use all of your ""Pandora minutes"", you have to pay extra to listen for the rest of the month. But it is a terrific and extremely useful app!)"

45352,"Pandora",2014-11-01,5,"Pandora's a WINNER!   Pandora is my go to music app on my ipad, iphone and my laptop. I've come to notice the more skips I use, the more ads play, be wary of that."
45354,"Pandora",2014-12-29,3,"Three Stars   O.k."
45355,"Pandora",2017-04-30,5,"👍👍   Love this app. Best music app. But I was listening to my favorite song and the app reset and I opened the app and it started with a different song 😭"
45358,"Pandora",2017-01-31,5,"Great product, shipping, communication A+   Grandson and his parents were very happy with these items."
45359,"Pandora",2014-05-06,5,"Pandora has it all   I have never been happier. My grandson set it up for me on my desk top computer about 5 or 6 years ago and have embraced ever since. One of the primary reasons why I like it so much is that I have some control over what I may want to listen to. Definitely 2 thumbs up."
45362,"Pandora",2017-05-15,3,"Three Stars   Way too many commercials and auto fed songs not related to my specific artist."
45366,"Pandora",2016-11-08,5,"Works great!!   Most used app I have. Works great."
45369,"Pandora",2015-11-20,5,"The best!   I am listening to Pandora right now.  As a matter of fact, I listen to it the entire time I am working on my computer.  I love that I get to make up my own radio stations and put on whichever station I feel like listening to."
45370,"Pandora",2017-02-25,4,"Ok   Ok"
45372,"Pandora",2013-10-09,5,"Rock on!!   I have Pandora on my phone, Pandora on my Pc and now Pandora on my Kindle Fire Hd. Does that say anything for this app? It is my fav music app. My kids can listen to the tween station, my man can listen to the Regional Mexicana station and I can rock it out!! So, yes this is an awesome app!!"
45374,"Pandora",2016-07-26,5,"I love Pandora! I haven't purchased it   I love Pandora! I haven't purchased it ,so I do get commercials, but they aren't long. Any song you can think of if at your fingertips!"
45376,"Pandora",2013-01-30,5,"love pandora everywhere i go...   I have Pandora on my phone,  kindle and computer. I listen while reading, eating dinner and when working. if you have problems on your computer open a new engine ( mozilla or firefox) and only use fir Pandora. you wont ever get ""stuck "" or poor playback as others complained. I am going to the Bahamas soon and hope I can use Pandora there!"
45377,"Pandora",2017-05-02,5,"The good old days of music   Love to listen to the music i grow up on"
45378,"Pandora",2017-01-26,4,"Four Stars   Turned out to be pretty good. Really learned my taste."
45387,"Pandora",2016-06-23,4,"Pretty good!   I wish it played more of the bands music on their station. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok"
45389,"Pandora",2014-11-24,5,"Fun app   Love Pandora. It's a great way to listen to music without downloading all of your mp3 songs. Doesn't take up near the space and you can change it up a bit really quickly."
45390,"Pandora",2013-06-02,4,"Hm....   I love this app over Iheart Radio because of the shuffle, as well as it plays more songs that I adore more often than its competitor. But the only downside I have found is the 40 hour listening limit on mobile devices. I personally haven't had a problem with the ads, mainly because I don't skip songs. All-in-all, a good app."
45393,"Pandora",2013-05-09,5,"Awesome!   This app is amazing!!! I couldn't ask for better, why download costly songs when you can download a free app to listen to all your favorite songs without pay. That's pretty cool. The only bad thing is that you need Internet connection to use, and some of the songs are innapropriate. But otherwise...I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS APP (:"
45395,"Pandora",2017-08-01,4,"then I'd love this app   If Pandora didn't have so many commercials, then I'd love this app. But, Amazon Music is love for me. :)"

45405,"Pandora",2012-04-15,4,"SO WORTH IT   this app is amazing! especially considering that it's free! I never have to buy music, I just make different channels, that I can adjust to my liking, and have playlists of songs that fit every mood. The occasional commercial, around one every 15 songs doesn't bother me, WHO CARES IT WAS FREE!!!!! ive never had problems with loading on my kindle fire or laptop. GET THIS APP!!! 5 stars."
45406,"Pandora",2016-03-29,5,"Five Stars   It always has such good music, and you can personalize the stations however you want! I really like Pandora!"
45411,"Pandora",2016-12-28,4,"does what it should   I don't subscribe/pay for Pandora, so I listen to the version with ads.  It works well, but can be a little glitchy when used on my phone."
45412,"Pandora",2013-08-15,4,"Its A Very Good App For People That Love Music!  The Only Thing That I Dislike About Pandora is that you can only change the so   I Love Pandora!  Its A Great App For People That Love Music....The Only Thing I Dislike About Pandora  Is That You Can Only Change The Song On A Track Six Times... But Other Than That Its Great!  I Would Rate It Four Stars Instead Of Five  Just Because Of The Issue With Skipping The Track Only Six Times."
45415,"Pandora",2017-02-24,3,"Works with Uber   I started using Pandora only because it's integrated with Uber, to allow customers to choose what content they want when using the car service."
45416,"Pandora",2017-08-11,4,"music   I'm giving it a good because it works, but they send  out these ratings way to soon to really test."

45444,"Pandora",2014-07-23,5,"Love it!   It is a great way to listen to music.It lets you create stations and like or dislike any songs.The only problem is that when you dislike or try to skip a song at the wrong time you get a annoying pop up that you have to respond to."
45446,"Pandora",2011-12-16,5,"Pandora-the best   I have found Pandora the most veratile and dependable of all the music suppliers. I use it on my ethernet connected TV, my PC, my Android X2 and my Kindle. Artists available are most all that I have looked for. Plus you can buy a song or an album if you like. Their variety of artists used has introduced me to new groups that I otherwise might not have heard. A very well thought out program."
45449,"Pandora",2017-06-16,5,"Music   It's a helpful and I love the music and yea so thanks and yayayy"
45453,"Pandora",2016-07-15,5,"Great Music   I love Pandora because no matter what kind of music you're into,you can get it on Pandora.I love old R&B and with Pandora I can plenty."
45457,"Pandora",2012-02-21,4,"stop complaining   people are saying that Pandora is declining, but i haven't experienced any problems that everyone is complaining about. my only issue is the commercials and they only come on like once an hour. the songs never stop randomly and pandoda is still working fine fkr me. if you're having a problem with Pandora, either suck it up and deal with it or use something else like iHeartRadio."
45458,"Pandora",2015-08-01,4,"woukd reccomend this to my friends!   It let's you pick your groups, and any song you do not like, can be changed (stopped) to something you should like ( only so many times though), that is the only part that needs to be changed! But this is totally free, which is quite nice!"
45466,"Pandora",2016-01-30,5,"great music like it knows me!   Great selections of the type of music I like! A few to adds but they need to get paid for a free site to use!"
45468,"Pandora",2017-08-31,5,"Five Stars   Love to hear my oldie's music."
45472,"Pandora",2012-10-28,3,"Needs another upgrade!   on the ipod if you bookmarks a track you can go to another feature on it and listen to all the songs you've bookmarked. on the kindle you bookmarks something and nothing really happens it just says track bookmarked or the songs name bookmarked. please make another update so we can listen to songs we bookmarks. wow I said bookmarks a lot:)"
45473,"Pandora",2015-12-14,5,"awesome   best app ever for music it puts out most bad words and can háve all most all stations u want so get it its good"
45474,"Pandora",2012-07-22,5,"its like genius and amazing had a baby!!!   ok this app is so amazing! u people that gave it any less than 5 stars are blind! this app is great for parties or u just want to jam!! yes the commercials are annoying sometimes but if u could just look past all that u would see the beautiful app that is Pandora!!!!! definitely a must-have app for all music lover's and definitely worthy of five stars!!"
45477,"Pandora",2014-05-25,4,"Good music--the way I like it   I like Pandora because you can choose the songs, artists, genre, etc. that you most enjoy. You even have the choice of liking or not a particular arrangement of a favorite song. Very helpful in providing background music while working."
45478,"Pandora",2016-08-28,5,"Great Selection   Great selection of a variety of types and styles of music."
45481,"Pandora",2016-12-30,4,"It's Alright   The app itself has a great layout and it functions fine most of the time. The only real issue I see is that the app continues to crash at random points while I'm listening to my music. While this is an issue I hope gets fixed quickly, I don't think you shouldn't get it just for that reason. The music plays fine and it goes on for a good hour or so before shutting off. I rate this 4/5 only because of that one problem."
45482,"Pandora",2013-08-17,5,"Love Pandora!   I love music and Pandora makes it really easy to listen to the music I love.  Where else can I get my BB King fix while I exercise at the gym?  Okay, so every once in a while I have to listen to a commercial, so what?  On typical broadcast radio there are many, many more commercials and the music generally is....(can I say this?) crap!Another great feature is that I can listen to Pandora at home on my Roku."
45484,"Pandora",2014-01-07,5,"Love it   I love the fact that you dictate what kind of music you want.  I listen to everything so I can have separate stations made up with whatever mood I'm in for the day.  I have my workout music on one station and I don't have to worry about skipping thru the songs."
45486,"Pandora",2016-07-15,4,"Review   The only flaw is the loading and amount of skips on certain song's."
45489,"Pandora",2012-01-12,5,"Can't understand.   I cant understand why there are so many negative reviews of this app it may not have occurred to some people that your network might have something to do with song skipping and force closure. This is a great app I have it on four different devices. Never had anything but stellar service on 3g 4g or wi-fi. My wife and kids love this app as well. I would give ten stars if I could."
45496,"Pandora",2013-03-31,3,"Works most times   I don't use these type of apps often because I have over 50000 songs in my cloud, but when I do use Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD, it works most times. Seems to stop playing after a few hours though and has commercials. When I use on my LG home theater (built into that) it never plays commercials and never quits until I turn it off. Not bad though for a free music radio. I tend to use Songza more often on the Fire HD then this one though."
45500,"Pandora",2016-02-09,1,"not too happy   Don't enjoy the concept of signing into an app on my BlackBerry.  Was not working well w the z 30."
45501,"Pandora",2016-08-29,5,"Pandora is perfect radio   Perfect Free Radio, i listen to it all dayat work. Easy dashboard. Subscription well worth it to get radio witout commercial interruptiin.Try new bands without spending money"
45508,"Pandora",2013-10-02,5,"Music   Gotta love Pandora.  So fun to gave music when and where ever you want . The commercials aren't terrible either"
45509,"Pandora",2016-11-06,3,"Three Stars   Good"
45511,"Pandora",2015-05-13,1,"Alarm stopped working after update   A great feature of this app was the alarm. I've been waking up to music since the alarm was added. No more. It no longer works after the last update. Please fix."
45515,"Pandora",2015-09-02,1,"not in Canada   Unfortunately after installing a popup appears on launch stating the service is not available in my country (Canada).  C'est la vie."
45516,"Pandora",2016-03-10,5,"Great app for students to use in the classroom when ...   Great app for students to use in the classroom when they earn positive breaks.  I made a teacher login and made appropriate stations for the kids to listen too."
45519,"Pandora",2012-12-21,4,"Pandora   I can play the artist I like.  Being a 1940s' guy I can get the big band music I enjoy and the vocalist of the 40s' singing music that you can actually understand."
45522,"Pandora",2012-10-11,5,"kerb   I love this app, its the best internet radio on the internet! No other app gives you the amount of versatility that Pandora does, I love Christian music and no other radio gives u the amount of artists that I have found on Pandora! Very little amount of commercials. Thank you Pandora for giving us Free Radio that is the best!!!"
45528,"Pandora",2014-03-17,5,"Especially for YOU   Pandora offers an Internet radio that is specifically designed for you! Pandora lets you pick out your Fave artists genres and even a specific song. Pandora will find things related to that!!! LOVE IT WAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATION!!!"
45529,"Pandora",2016-07-29,5,"Love Pandora.   Love pandora and all the stations they have. I had a paid Subscription for awhile but cancelled it. The ads really aren't that annoying."
45533,"Pandora",2015-02-22,5,"amazing app   every on if u read this then u know that this is a good app because it gives u free music to listen to on the road or just in your house with free music when ever u want"
45540,"Pandora",2014-05-12,4,"anyway a good app to relax and be happy because you can listen all types music   is a great app for adults and kids to listen all types of music but the only problem is that when you want to change from radio station stock and you cant changed and have to wait until done the last song that you listening"
45541,"Pandora",2013-07-08,2,"What Happened   I just got a new kindle and re downloaded everything and Pandora so many new limits it sucks so bad like only 40 hours free mobile listening and only 6 skips total per day what happened to 6 skips per station per day uuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhh Pandora used to be my favorite music app"
45542,"Pandora",2016-12-26,5,"All venues comedy, holiday, pop, gospel   best variety of music comedy even some podcasts. I have been a fan of Pandora radio for years never gets old, love it! 😜"

45575,"Pandora",2012-06-03,5,"da best   Pandora is amazing I always have it on my Tv when I'm cleaning or just wanna listen to music . my life basically revolves around music so I would so recommend this to people who love listening to music!  you can create ur stations nd sometimes find songs u never thought u will like,  I love it && I'm positive u will too :)"
45576,"Pandora",2012-03-07,5,"Dunno why you hatin.   I dunno why everyone here is saying it sucks on the kindle fire. Its awesome on the KF and the music comes out very clearly and smoothly. I've never had to deal with a force close with Pandora and although commercials do occur they are not as constant as many people lead first-time Pandora users to believe. Do not fall to the lies children!!!"
45578,"Pandora",2012-11-16,4,"Could be a little better   The android app doesn't let you create new stations from a song currently playing, among other functionality present in the web version. Also songs take a long time to load sometimes, which is annoying, I don't like having gaps of silence between songs. Other than that I like the Pandora Android App a lot!"
45581,"Pandora",2016-08-23,4,"Works great, great music   Works great, exposure to new music with similar aspects of what you like.  It's a great feature to expand your groove."
45584,"Pandora",2013-01-08,4,"love it   I love this app. it can get a little glitchy at times but for the most part runs smoothly. if I do have trouble with a station I just switch the station or restart the app. its a great companion for when I get bored of the music I have. nice way to learn of new artists. I definitely reccomend it."
45586,"Pandora",2014-09-03,5,"amazing   I think that this is a great app I have it on all of my electronics and it has all different types of music for all different types of people I love this app and I think you should get it."

I can listen on my computer, on my Roku, on my phone, and on my Kindle Fire HD.  I've been a Pandora One subscriber for the last two years and it is the best $30 I spend each year."
45628,"Pandora",2015-03-18,3,"Why?   I would give this five stars but if I type in the name of a song it would be nice to hear that song or at least songs by the same musicians."
45631,"Pandora",2012-01-31,5,"awesome on kindle fire   this app loads nicely and is very easy to navigate.  it's great to listen to music while reading to drown out distracting noises like the tv. create multiple artist or group radio stations and enjoy the music.  it even has a shuffle function.  the ads are short and far in between so not a nuisance at all.  love, love, love this app."
45633,"Pandora",2012-06-05,5,"Easy to use   This app works great on my Kindle Fire. The Pandora App will keep playing music in the background while you read, which is nice. I was able to easily able to log into my existing Pandora account and access my stations. It was also easy to create new stations using this app. No problems here and a nice addition to my Fire."
45634,"Pandora",2014-01-14,5,"Never used it   I never really used it but I like PandoraI use it all the time on my phone. Awesome app"

I have discovered many fantastic artists and listened to well over 2000 hours, thanks Pandora for providing such an amazing service :)"
45651,"Pandora",2015-06-28,5,"let me download this app   It should be for  allage cause everyone love to listen to songs, cause it makes them be  who they want to be"
45652,"Pandora",2013-07-09,4,"I Love It!   Often I like music, but can't identify the artist.  This app allows me to do that.  In addition, it provides me with ""like"" artists; music of the same genre or by the same artist which I would not necessarily seek out.  I love these features."

45691,"Pandora",2012-09-10,5,"Why is everyone so negative?   This app is just fine. I really don't see why people are so negative. It plays my music uninterrupted without problem. Who cares if it plays the same advertisement over and over? It isn't after every song like other reviewers said. Don't read the negative reviews. Try it for yourself."
45695,"Pandora",2013-04-26,4,"meh   I love the music choices, but I think its stupid how we have to pay for it after a certain number of hours I. the mobile devices. I mean, if its free on the computer then why do you have to pay for it here?? so I guess its back to iheartradio for me"
45697,"Pandora",2014-05-24,5,"I just kick back and listen   I just kick back and listen to my favorite tunes.  I'm 63 years old still working and when I come home from work, I pick up my tablet and go to Pandora, start it up, start listening. I like 60's 70's and 80's.  I then go to my favorite media outlets (you know what they are), read through those while listening.  I haven't heard a bad song yet."
45710,"Pandora",2013-12-09,1,"Cant Work in Italy's   I live in Italy and when I first opened this app I was really exited. Then it said ""Pandora is not available in this country"" I am very dissapointed. For those with my problem I suggest iheartradio."
45713,"Pandora",2014-07-25,3,"free muisc   this is a great app but there are to many breaks from the muisc and I think we should be albe. to skip as much song as we want but other then that it is a great app."
45717,"Pandora",2014-02-01,5,"amazing   this app is a must have for all music lovers! it lets you create personalized stations and doubles as a social media type thing so you can listen to music and talk to friends that also use Pandora."

45742,"Pandora",2014-12-05,5,"love it   The only thing I don't like about Pandora is, you have only five skips. And after that you have to listen to the rest of the songs."
45746,"Pandora",2015-03-31,4,"Good app   Does what I want it to do and more. I have had no problems with it so far and look forward to using it often."
45748,"Pandora",2012-07-03,5,"AWESOME   this app is great. I love it! You just put your favorite songs and then it plays songs that are like it! you can also like songs to play them again later or you can do thumbs down so it will skip the song you don't like and it will never play it again. Hope you like this app I loved it."
45759,"Pandora",2014-02-26,5,"Love Pandora   This is an great music app to get.I can listen to my favorite artist anywhere I go.Get this app!!! It is awesome app.Please get Pandora its FREE yah I said it.FREEE FREEE FREE!!!!!!!!"
45762,"Pandora",2013-10-09,1,"Terrible recently   I would give pandora 5 stars, it's an awesome way to listen to music, if it was working without me having to shut down my kindle every time I wanted to use it. I can literally turn it on, listen to one song, turn it off, and try again and it won't work. It just shows the blue loading screen. Every single time. I want to use it, but I've used already this time? Shut down my kindle, and hope it works."
45765,"Pandora",2012-09-30,1,"ARE U KIDDING ME?!   whenever you make a radio station it play barely anything u want and plays mostly random music. example: my Hollywood undead radio is playing tech n9ne Stevie stone and worst of all Toby Keith country music on a rock station W...T...F! DO NOT GET THIS APP IT IS CRAP"
45768,"Pandora",2017-08-23,5,"Great App   Great App"
45770,"Pandora",2014-10-16,3,"Not so grand   Yes,  it worked well for a month.  Now,  it crashes everytime I use it!  Also, the song selections at times, leave a little to be desired."
45773,"Pandora",2016-02-28,4,"Four Stars   All my favorite music.  I like it."
45780,"Pandora",2013-10-05,3,"in your country   Pandora is in this country,  it was working an hour ago in Kyrgyzstan. Then I tried adding a playlist and it stopped working. So my problem is why don't you want it to work over seas you greedy pieces feces"
45781,"Pandora",2013-08-18,1,"refresh-ing   Had to refresh after every song. Very frustrating! Don't think it was my fault either, if it was my Droid, shame on Pandora for having such a bad app."

45797,"Pandora",2011-11-15,4,"like it, but has its flaws   I have the paid version.  the free version became pointless because of the commercials, just like spotify and terrestrial radio.  the biggest flaw of pandora in the android/fire version is the lack of a way to filter out bands that you don't like...unless it's right in front of me and I didn't see it."
45800,"Pandora",2014-12-23,3,"commercials   Too many commercials breaking up the flow of the music, and the ads to upgrade to paid service, when it was always free"
45801,"Pandora",2015-01-11,5,"Awesome!!!   Great app. I always have trouble finding a perfect app for my music. But I found it!! It's so helpful. I love it :P"

45824,"Pandora",2011-12-27,5,"works perfectly   this app has worked perfectly, never skipping, stalling, or repeated ads. I would recomend it for everyone I haven't had trouble with it once but of you do i would.uninstall and reinstall"

45831,"Pandora",2014-02-03,4,"pandora   I think that Pandora is a great app and would recommend it to anybody but the one thing that pisses me off is how after you skip a couple songs they wont let you skip anymore"
45836,"Pandora",2013-06-03,1,"40 Hour Listening Cap- ARE YOU CRAZY?????   I used to LOVE Pandora!  Friendly interface, great intuition to what music to play, etc... until NOW.  For free radio, the cap is now 40 hours per month.  Are you for real??  With all of the ads floating on this thing, suddenly, you want US to pay YOU $3.99???  Take a powder, Pandora!I started using RADITAZ, people!!!  Free radio, no ads, no limits, except on how many songs you can skip in one hour.  Even has a carosel for songs.  So, for now, my radio needs are taken care of via Raditaz or TuneIn Radio (free version).  Pandora must be INSANE!!"
45837,"Pandora",2016-05-12,5,"Five Stars   Awesome"
45839,"Pandora",2017-09-24,5,"Great tool   Great music app"

45845,"Pandora",2012-11-13,3,"Glitchy   I really like Pandora.  But for some reason, and only recently, I can't exit the app on my Kindle Fire.  The button for the option to quit will not respond.  I thought it was my Kindle but the button works fine on my phone and other devices. I have to shut down to close it.  I may be  crazy and it's only me with this issue but is there anyone else having this problem?"

45863,"Pandora",2016-02-03,5,"review   Pandora is an amazing app"
45864,"Pandora",2014-06-23,4,"Better & Better   It just keeps getting better. Constantly making improvements. Pandora exceeds all expectations for quality and ease of use. Two words: awe some!"
45867,"Pandora",2013-11-05,4,"The new update   I like the app. just after the last update I got it wont let me sign back. it just says it is having technical issues. to get on I have to uninstall the app and redownload it everytime."
45868,"Pandora",2012-02-11,5,"Best online music with a great app   There is a free Pandora and there is a pay version.  This app allows for both but if you don't have a subscription then expect commercials and popups.  The yearly fee is worth the price; no apps, no ads and higher bitrate streaming.I love Pandora and this app does it justice."
45872,"Pandora",2017-06-24,5,"Five Stars   love it"
45880,"Pandora",2012-12-28,4,"Forget broadcast radio   Pick a fav artist or song and build your stations.  Very few commercials on free version. Been using for years...no complaints. Almost as good as XM .Add some adult talk stations, like Opie & Anthony. Then 4 stars gets 5 stars."
45881,"Pandora",2013-08-19,1,"hmm   This thing isn't letting me listen to music !! I haven't been able to for like 2 weeks !! I'm done, I'm going to another music app !!"
45894,"Pandora",2017-10-24,2,"Two Stars   Too many commercials!"
45896,"Pandora",2012-11-25,5,"Its wonderful, except   I love the app, and when the kindle is plugged into the charger battery life isn't the problem. But after every two songs it plays the same annoying advertisement, I know that's how Pandora makes money. But come on, every two songs???"
45901,"Pandora",2012-10-22,4,"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!   I really love this app. Its free entrrtainment. I can listen to it at my house whenever I want to. I only with they'd let you skip as many times as you want, but that's to be expected. I also wish you could take it where there is no wifi."
45902,"Pandora",2017-09-11,5,"Five Stars   Great product listen daily."
45904,"Pandora",2016-03-14,5,"Five Stars   Love it!!"
45913,"Pandora",2013-07-23,5,"Excellent music alternative   No commercials just music tailored to your own tastes. It also provides tracks that are similar to your own favorites. The yearly license is worth the small investment. XM radio and Sirius cannot compete with this. The only drawback if there is one is that they have a time limit where if you don't rate/skip a track or whatever it will go into a play pause mode until you tell them you are still listening. A small price to pay."
45914,"Pandora",2017-08-12,5,"Five Stars   The best"
45917,"Pandora",2016-03-19,5,"Five Stars   Niceee"

45932,"Pandora",2016-03-03,5,"Five Stars   awesome"
45937,"Pandora",2011-11-10,2,"Used to be good.   I had to go back to an old version to just get it to work. Still very sketchy using that. Takes a minute to load the first song then twenty seconds to over a minute to play the next song. Do you call that quality? Because I don't. I've had better luck using Slacker. Droid X2"
45941,"Pandora",2014-03-16,5,"Awesome!!!   this is a really, really good app! love it! I highly recommend this for anyone who loves music like I do! it works really well on my kindle fire too."

45966,"Pandora",2014-05-05,5,"love it   loved it great opputunities for life for you and me and great music I guess.thanks for the oppurtunity google and I want to thank my mom"
45968,"Pandora",2013-10-27,4,"love it but sometimes doesnt work   I love it but sometimes it doesn't work on my phone it will just have a blue Pandora screen so I have to shut my phone down then turn it back on just to listen to music."
45974,"Pandora",2011-12-17,5,"love it on all devices   I have this on my Bionic, my Fire, my Xoom and my desktop at work and it works flawlessly. I use it to stream music during my commute too. Much better than commercial radio with all the chatter! I'm also a member, it's well worth the price if you're a music junkie."
45980,"Pandora",2015-08-20,5,"Great app for Music streaming   Always a good choice for music streaming. Available on all platforms."
45982,"Pandora",2015-01-01,1,"This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's)   I am using it on my Black Berry.  The app I had (Apollo) stop working and of course, Black Berry doesn't have another.  No surprise, don't ask.  This app is a poor substitute at best (for Black Berry's).  It is not clear, actually has static over the channel and hard to navigate.  I will keep it because I love Pandora but, continue to look for an alternative."
45985,"Pandora",2012-01-09,5,"Great App on Kindle Fire   I have not had this app ""force close"" on me ever on my Kindle Fire.  It is nicely designed and gives easy access to all the same capabilities as the Pandora web site.  If you want another mobile option for access to Pandora, I highly recommend getting this app."
45987,"Pandora",2013-11-13,5,"Love it!   I use this everyday getting ready for school and stuff. Very useful and easy to use. Sometimes though it doesn't load and that gets frustrating but I still love it."

45991,"Pandora",2014-07-16,4,"Crashes?   My Pandora usually works amazing and how it's supposed to, but lately it's been crashing and stopping for no apparent reason. I have a kindle fire hdx so if you could fix it please, it crashed about twice both times on songs I Was singing too sigh. Please check this out."
45998,"Pandora",2012-12-11,4,"better than others   this app has almost all the music in the world. and some apps are realy bad and u have to pay for it.on my kindle u get commercials every 7 songs or something like that and they are only 30 seconds most of the time"
46004,"Pandora",2012-01-21,5,"Pandora the Best   Pandora is the best.  You can find anything you want to listen too. Loads Quickly and you get to make your own stations, rate songs, jump to next song if you don't like listening to one.  It doesn't cut in and out like regular radio.  Great for road trips."
46006,"Pandora",2015-08-13,4,"Four Stars   Great stations..they just repeat A LOT!!"
46010,"Pandora",2012-11-20,5,"Get the app  :)   Its a radio what more do these people want.  Its got a lot more features than the radio in your car.  It barely ever plays a commercial.  So I don't see why everyone is Downing padora when its a really good app.  :)"
46012,"Pandora",2012-12-03,2,"Disappointing   I used to use this app all the time.  But lately it will just randomly stop playing - all too often.  I can only get it to play one or two songs now before it quits.  It's unusable now.  I hope it gets fixed soon."
46015,"Pandora",2016-01-04,5,"Five Stars   Love it!"
46020,"Pandora",2012-02-07,5,"Kirk Franklin   Pandora is great and I recommend this site to everyone that I know who doesn't already use it! I have never had any problem with Pandora only a great experience. I just wish I could afford to buy the service where I would have un-interupted playback."
46021,"Pandora",2013-05-26,5,"Great app!   I love this app! I will turn it on when ever i want to listen to music!! The only problem is occasionally it will like skip and pause and stuff when my kindle is doing too much at once."
46022,"Pandora",2012-08-08,5,"single artist   to those complaining about it not playing enough of the artist you make the channel for, the riaa regulates them and only allow them to play a single artist 6 times with in a 3 hour period on a given ""channel""per user"

46024,"Pandora",2013-09-16,1,"sucks   this app froze and never came back I had to reset my kindle and lost everything that I put on my kindle"
46025,"Pandora",2012-04-18,2,"Frustrating on Kindle Fire!!!   I am frustrated with this android app for Kindle Fire. Why can I not add content to a newly created station? Did Pandora now take features away from the free subscribers?  What gives?  If so, it's. not the best way to encourage upgrading...."
46031,"Pandora",2012-09-24,5,"my favorite music channel   This station is just awesome. It plays music almost nonestop. The advertisements are very just very short onset. It does not matter if you listen to it in the car or at home or wherever you are I just can't get. enough."

46042,"Pandora",2013-08-09,5,"Music & Comedy   I enjoy Pandora. It lets you listen to a wide range of music and even stand up comedies by different comedians. The only thing I dislike is the ads but there aren't many."

46047,"Pandora",2012-06-17,3,"its ok i guess   there's to many commercails! there the same ones too. you cant look up a song because when you do you have to listen to a random playlist. if you look up feel so close by Calvin Harris you get skrillex and all these random song's!"
46054,"Pandora",2013-04-23,5,"awesome   I love this app I listen to it every day and I like how they updated it. this is so cool and there is some songs I haven't heard in a while that I like plus you create your own stations."
46059,"Pandora",2013-12-09,5,"Pandora rocks!   Love being able to listen to the artists I like and not ALL artists.  Having the program suggest artists that I might not be familiar with is great."
46060,"Pandora",2012-02-25,4,"works good for me!   Downloaded this morning on my Fire. No buttering issues, and very few commercials. Very good for a free app, the only reason i would upgrade is to be able to skip more times per hour. All in all, it made my long day of overtime very pleasant!"

46078,"Pandora",2012-06-02,5,"Great the best radio app on kindle   I love how it has every type of music and even comedy I listen to Daniel Tosh radio all the time and they even have really obscure artists. I have tried all the other radio apps and this one really stands out to me as the best."

46095,"Pandora",2013-05-26,4,"great radio app   The wide selection of music available and the ability to create your own personal genre and musician stations are awesome. I just wish I could skip more than 6 songs per hour."

46114,"Pandora",2012-12-31,1,"Not A Fan.   I don't get why Pandora is sooo popular! A. You need WiFi, which the Kindle Fire doesn't always have. B. You need an account. C. Only plays music it thinks you like. WASTE OF MEMORY STORAGE! -DJ"
46115,"Pandora",2014-01-21,5,"Anna~G35   Love all the underground tunes and there's a great variety of genres as well. The absence of advertising is my most favorite feature."
46119,"Pandora",2013-01-26,5,"great music for free   I would give pandora 10 stars. I have siriusxm and it doesn't compare. You can select the artiste or type of music and it will play so much better than listening to music you don't care for."

46146,"Pandora",2012-10-06,5,"Best Radio   You can listen to radio right on your device but u have to have WIFI so instead of buying a radio you can you can save money by downloading this free app and add stations and pick any music to listen to."
46150,"Pandora",2012-07-20,4,"ok not the best   Pandora is a great way to listen to music but I don't like that example:if u click on Chris brown you hear trey songs like if I click on a certain artist that's all I want to hear tbh but its not s bad app to have"

46168,"Pandora",2013-01-27,5,"great   Pandora gives me the music I like without having buy and download hundreds of different songs. I had a satellite radio account for many years but find Pandora to be superior in content."

46247,"Pandora",2014-04-02,4,"love it, BUT...   As great a resource for music lovers Pandora is, some things aren't as great.  For example, the first thing you want to hear on johnny cash radio is not the whatshisface impersonator guy from the I Walk The Line sound track.  And today, it seemed the only Chubby Checkers, The Twist track miss Pandora could find was from THE SON OF MASK SOUNDTRACK!!!!! WHYYYYYIZSSSITLIKETHIS?????"

46977,"Pandora",2011-10-24,2,"Not for me   I didn't really like the way Pandora chose music for me. I'd try to get it to go more toward my genre, but it inevitably would veer off toward another genre and toward music I wasn't interested in. It also set up ""stations"" too frequently.I ended up deleting Pandora, and will have to find another app which suits me more."
46986,"Pandora",2011-12-16,1,"All I get is the Splash Screen on my Kindle Fire   If you've got a Kindle Fire, forget this app.  It works on all of my other devices (iPhone, iPad, Windows 7 laptop, and Mac mini).  Bummer."
46990,"Pandora",2012-01-26,5,"i love it   my daughter thought I would not like, but I love it lets you create what ever station you want just for you. listen ti it all the time"
46999,"Pandora",2012-12-02,3,"soso   I like this app but sometimes two songs play at the same time and it has a stupid skipping limit"
47006,"Pandora",2015-01-09,5,"Once you go Pandora, no other apps will get to store ya (identity). (corny I know, but I'm tired and its catchy)   Great app especially if you pay the extra 5 bucks a month for the plus edition. I know their margins are really high on the premium edition and as a whole they play really predictable music but to my knowledge no other app or program in general offers a comparable service. Who can beat Pandora?"
47011,"Pandora",2013-02-20,5,"awesome   this is so cool and just so easy you should try it out why not try its free. try it"
47023,"Pandora",2017-07-18,4,"Four Stars   It's good, but you can't play back songs."
47024,"Pandora",2017-07-19,5,"Great app   What's to say. It works awesome. On my echo there is no commercials."
47033,"Pandora",2012-05-24,4,"It's Alright.   well its ok but sometimes it skips my songs. and the minimum of songs skipped is stupid. but otherwise its alright."
47034,"Pandora",2011-10-23,5,"Pandora   Best app ever made. Love the music and it broadened my horizons. I have more bands I love and listen too that are just like my favorites."
47043,"Pandora",2012-04-21,5,"i love it!!!   i love pandora...so i dont hav to bye any music i can get pandora for free!!! you listen to every music you love!!!!!"
47045,"Pandora",2012-02-03,3,"so,so   I like it but the thing is when u look up an artist a totally different artist comes up and they limit you on skipping  songs"
47049,"Pandora",2014-07-10,5,"Five Stars   GREAT LISTENING"
47057,"Pandora",2017-01-16,1,"Bad people   Supports black lives matter"
47060,"Pandora",2011-12-10,4,"great to have a personal radio station   I like how the program tailor fits my needs. Sometimes I hear new songs and artists that I like and wound not have heard otherwise"
47062,"Pandora",2012-07-28,5,"I love this app   it matches my mood and I like some wired music but pandora showed me artists that ive never heard before"
47065,"Pandora",2012-03-14,3,"songs not finishing..?   Almost every song on my free account stops playing before the end of the song. Even free the whole song should play. :("

47181,"Pandora",2012-01-22,4,"love it!!   love this app so much it really fun to listen to. But, there are a lot of added popping up everywhere!"
47182,"Pandora",2012-03-06,3,"needs work   Its a great app but you cant look up songs!also when I type in a band it play other groups to!!!!"
47184,"Pandora",2013-12-18,5,"Pandora   Love the music,that you can choose yourself.Regular radio stations now,just don't do a thing for me.Pandora has something dor everyone.LOVE IT!!!!!!!"
47187,"Pandora",2012-12-18,3,"Eh...   Well first of all it will only let u skip 6 Songs and on almost on all of ur stations it will say 'We can not fetch anymore songs. Please try again.' I get mad when tht happens...like it just did.  But over all it had ALMOST all the artist that I wanted..."
47190,"Pandora",2013-01-19,5,"I <3 PANDORA   I love,love,love Pandora!!!!!!!!! It has all my favorite singers and more!!!!!! I recommend this app COMPLETELY for any age and it is FREE!!!!!!!"
47191,"Pandora",2012-01-25,1,"poop   I hate it how did I get it I'm so confused its like a piece of poop shaved and poured into a radio."
47197,"Pandora",2012-01-16,5,"good   This app is goodHas cool things and is exciting and is coolIts fun and coolHas good songs too"
47212,"Pandora",2011-10-20,5,"One of the best apps   Pandora is one of the best apps, plus it's free!  You can use in your car in place of satellite radio."
47213,"Pandora",2012-02-14,5,"pandora   this app is awesome. it plays all the new music and it takes up no space on my kindle fire."
47228,"Pandora",2012-06-25,1,"this sucks   Pandora is a bad app when you type in what you want to listen to half the time it does not go to it. it takes you to a differnt song do not get this app. you are better of getting songs from the store or get them some where else this app is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
47231,"Pandora",2013-07-01,4,"Curses   it's  good but pandora curses. you can also only have a certain amount of skips but it is ok. i do like how you can create stations and flip through them. you can also use it on the interweb which is also very helpful"
47234,"Pandora",2012-12-14,1,"Great down to BAD   I agree with everyone else, the app stops playing and doesnt start back up, I thought I was having issues with my kindle until I started reading the reviews, Thanks everyone!!"
47237,"Pandora",2012-02-24,1,"Sucks   It Sucks. I like I heart radio better. To many adds. Buffing takes so looooooong. I'm unstalling. And it repeats."
47240,"Pandora",2012-02-14,1,"not working   everytime I try to use,getting an error message. I've. installed and uninstalled several times...if anyone else is having this issue please help me... I really love Pandora. and would love to use it on my kindle..."
47243,"Pandora",2013-01-19,5,"pandora is beast   I love Pandora so much and it is the best because I can listen to any type of music that I want to listen too"
47249,"Pandora",2012-01-13,1,"do not want!!!   I wish I could remove this app from my list. especially since it is not part of the kindle rom and I will never download it.besides, I've been a rhapsody customer since 2002. I'm not likely to switch to this crap now."
47250,"Pandora",2013-01-22,5,"Nothing but AWESOMNESS!!! :D   This is a great app. It. lets you listen to music for free and you can still hear that song again by liking it. You can hear your favorite artist's songs without hearing the same song three million times. This is a BIG must have app."
47251,"Pandora",2017-04-16,4,"Awesome   I love this, I can listen all my favorite artists and find new ones! The reason for the 4 star is because it skips songs by itself and that's really annoying when it's one of my favorites... otherwise it's Amazing!!"
47254,"Pandora",2012-04-12,1,"it worked at first....   I have had Pandora for about 4 monthes now and it has been great...untill now. I turn it on and it goes to my station screen and..just..stops. I even deleted it and downloaded it again and still nothing. so if you are wanting to listen to music without it messing up, don't waste your time with this app."
47259,"Pandora",2012-05-19,1,"it wont let me sign up!   that's not cool. I put my email address and everything else in correctly numerous times and it continued to tell me ""you are unable to create a Pandora"""
47261,"Pandora",2013-06-28,2,"Poor pandora   Pandora has good music but the commercial's after almost every song is awful! It ruins the listening experience. They need to figure out another way to make money!"
47267,"Pandora",2012-12-30,1,"HATE IT 0stares   its give my kids bad names and then they repet the words hats it so much I hats it I hats it I hats it.I don't like it"
47268,"Pandora",2013-01-26,1,"get i heart radio its better   this one has ads and with ads it sucks I heart radio is much better it lets u choose an artist or song and its a wholl thing with many diffrent  songs by other artist"
47275,"Pandora",2016-12-27,4,"3 out of 4   3 Stars of this Rating goes to the Position side, while on the other 1 Star goes to the negitive.  Pros.  Radios, Music, can skip many filthy songs and much more.  Cons, you have a skip limit,  so if a bad so if a bad song comes on your screwed...😐"
47278,"Pandora",2012-01-15,1,"Sucks!!   Sucks don't get waste of time is very sluggish don't get DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS It SUCKZ!!!!!"

47292,"Pandora",2016-01-02,2,"Blah   Same old crap..."
47300,"Pandora",2013-03-08,1,"worthless   i want to like this app , but its worthless. i got it on my kindle fire and i play it put it in sleep mode it will play couple songs then stop. i unsleep my kindle and the app will be asking if im still listening."
47302,"Pandora",2012-02-07,1,"NO   I downloaded this for my kids that I babysit l. I added a. baby song for toddlers and I' m sexy and I know it can on!"
47313,"Pandora",2013-11-15,4,"meh!   Enjoy the variety of music I'm able to listen to. Like being able to learn about the bands I like."
47315,"Pandora",2011-10-14,5,"Woop woop   Finally. Some Pandora love. Lets just hope Amazon keeps up with the updates. If theres one app that should be updated when need be, its this one."
47318,"Pandora",2012-09-30,1,"grand   I have not used. this site just yet but will get back to you! This. seems to be a nuisance.  To have to put my input just yet."
47324,"Pandora",2013-04-17,5,"MY NEW BFF   this is the best music app ive ever used and I love it!!! when I'm home and bored I am always using it! :)"
47325,"Pandora",2011-10-17,2,"Find another app than this one.   Tracks basically everything on your phone, from phone calls, txts to gps location and more. There are better Internet streaming radio apps on Android Marketplace or Amazon Appstore that do not do that. Don't waste your time with this one."
47331,"Pandora",2012-12-19,5,"Awesome   I love this app it is awesome. I can listen to any kind of music I like and if I don't like song I can skip it"
47335,"Pandora",2013-03-12,5,"nice   ward slap paper awesome app love the music mama I wish u could add more things to your profile though"
47338,"Pandora",2013-11-14,1,"what a rip off don't get this app   This is a rip off because as soon as I got loged in it said  can't take my login at this time and I just got it.so don't even think about getting this app because it is a rip off. I should not given it one star."
47346,"Pandora",2012-08-11,4,"needs to let you skip more songs   need to let you skip more songs and have no limit on how many songs you can skip. plz read comment."
47347,"Pandora",2017-04-26,3,"Three Stars   I have CD's that I like better."
47350,"Pandora",2012-08-14,1,"why   why do you have to have a account when I got it I just deleted it I recommend I heart radio"
47352,"Pandora",2012-12-04,1,"stinks   stops playing music after about three songs. ads will pop up  and it stops. used to be great. please update. kindle fire"
47355,"Pandora",2011-12-25,5,"Love it   love it. always plays music i like. and turns me on to new artist I may not have heard before"

47363,"Pandora",2017-07-27,5,"Five Stars   Great music mix!"
47364,"Pandora",2011-12-28,1,"Doesn't play on Kindle Fire   Completely dead on Kindle Fire, no music plays at all. going to have to try alternatives now. Pandora has really gone downhill."
47367,"Pandora",2012-09-28,1,"1.7.1 Poor audio quality, lack of privacy   Either the upgrade to 1.7.1 or some change on the hosting side caused the audio to lose all the highs.  I thought my tweeters were busted at first but no, every other audio application sounds fine.  The music barely sounds like it's in stereo any longer.  And why would a music player need to read my phone state (which includes the phone numbers of who is calling).  Pandora is going the way of Netflix, losing customers by dropping service quality."
47370,"Pandora",2017-07-18,5,"Five Stars   Love the music!!"
47372,"Pandora",2012-09-19,1,"no, you may not email my mom   ...and I can't imagine why anyone would let you. these permissions are insane. I absolutely do NOT agree, this app is mediocre at best... yes, Pandora was soooo cool a few years ago, but we have slacker and spotify and 8tracks and so much more now. certainly not worth all this hassle to hear commercials and out-of-date indie rock."
47381,"Pandora",2017-07-17,3,"Its ok   It always says that I can't find a connection so I have to press retry like 5 times before it actually works, then its really laggy. And every time I try to have it in the background so I can hear music while using another app it quits working. Overall as much as I like Pandora I'll just stick with Spotify it doesn't have any of these issues"
47383,"Pandora",2012-01-12,4,"ads?   I thought this wasn't supposed to have ads. aside from quite a lot of buffering if I try and change the song and the ads at the bottom its pretty great."
47386,"Pandora",2012-11-28,1,"Nov 2012   pandora has been great for 2 years but this week it plays one song when i first start it then it hangs there and does not play any more songs."
47389,"Pandora",2013-04-08,4,"music   love to listen to music especially when I'm working and you can pick whatever kind of music you like to listen to"
47397,"Pandora",2017-10-07,2,"fix or ill rate one star   The reason I gave 2 stars is because whenever I type a song name or the artist I don't get the song or artist I want so plz fix it only works on my phone I'm on tablet"
47398,"Pandora",2017-06-10,5,"Numero uno!   Use pandora every day. For driving to work, relaxing at home, partiea. Any day, every day, any time. Great app, wide selection!"
47399,"Pandora",2011-12-01,2,"other radio apps better   Navigation quirky. Ads all-pervasive. Sound quality mediocre. Maybe good if you're already a Pandora fan. Otherwise, skip it. Uninstalling from my Kindle fire."
47408,"Pandora",2016-12-14,2,"It kind of works   It randomly cuts on in the middle of the night  some times when you unlock my device"
47411,"Pandora",2015-02-14,5,"Five Stars   💜"
47413,"Pandora",2011-10-26,4,"Needs a couple features from Slacker   I like Pandora more than Slacker, but Pandora has no ""never play this artist"" feature. So when Brittany Spears comes on, I have to thumbs down her one song versus her entire career."
47414,"Pandora",2016-03-20,1,"not fun   Every password u type won't work on kindle fire!"
47418,"Pandora",2011-11-19,1,"Never completes a song, force closes.   Only plays few seconds of song before skipping to the next. Force closes a lot. Plays a complete commercial every two songs. Since it never completes a song it's all commercial. Deleted (Same problem on non-Amazon version) Droid2Global"
47421,"Spotify",2017-10-07,5,"spotify is great   Spotify is way, way, way, way, way, way better music app than Pandora. It doesn't limit you on the musicians you actually like with awful musicians with a few of your favorite songs peppered in between garbage pail cousin  music and brown water trash one hit wonders. Spotify let's you play whole albums and let's you make custom and endless playlists."
47424,"Spotify",2017-03-07,5,"The ony music app you neec   I love this app. I've tried them all (apple, amazon, pandora) and nothing compares. The suggestions are awesome, I'm finding new music all the time. Also, you can pick up where you left off on any device. Spotify is the best, period."
47428,"Spotify",2017-10-14,5,"Best Choice for Music   Listening to music on demand has never been better than it is with Spotify. The app not only provides access to thousands of classic tracks, but it provides great recommendations for music you might like based on your listening history. Highly recommended!"
47429,"Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"Great app!   I really like being able to pull up my favorite songs and adding them to a playlist. I also really like how it recommends new music for me based on what I already listen to."
47432,"Spotify",2016-04-10,5,"Awesome music   This app is wonderfully diverse in its music content. You can create your own playlist or listen to individual songs. Typing in an artist name reveals lots of albums and hit songs."
47443,"Spotify",2017-10-26,5,"Great Music App   Great app, has every kind of music that you like. You can find a lot of great songs that you would not have found before. Also you can listen to old music or new music."
47456,"Spotify",2016-03-02,4,"Good App   I find that this app is better than others that I have tried. However it does seem to freeze up from time to time during songs changings I guess nothing is perfect. The download went fine with no hangups. Overall it's a good application."
47457,"Spotify",2017-08-26,5,"Spotlight is great   I just love spotlight premiumI don't have to listen to ads and interrupt my listening  they have all the great songs"
47458,"Spotify",2017-06-08,5,"Spotify   I love all the premade playlists."
47462,"Spotify",2017-04-21,5,"Spotify perks   Works very well on my tablet and even plays while I play a game. Spotify premium is even better because there are no commercials and that is the best."
47463,"Spotify",2016-02-19,4,"Great Music App   Has lots of popular songs, however I was disappointed that Taylor Swift wasn't on here. She is my favorite singer, so I wanted to hear her music. Otherwise, good music app. You can create your own public channels and playlists. I recommend"

The ability to follow others and listen to their playlists tops the cake for me. I love me music, and listen to different styles depending on my mood.  Only issue is that I am so very poor at remembering song artists, song names, etc.........this is a blessing."

Music sets a mood.  The commercials are such a jarring clash of genres that it destroys the mood of the music.  These interruptions are truly ill conceived.  I doubt popular music listeners would appreciate their music being interrupted by musical commercials for the Met."
47527,"Spotify",2016-01-15,5,"excellent   For someone like me who has eclectic tastes and listen to music based on moods this is perfect. I was told it as a good music service but I didn't want to try out of stubbornness but now I wish I had it sooner. Get the premium. It's worth it"
47535,"Spotify",2015-11-12,5,"Perfect!♥   Its awesome so much better than Pandora!  But what would make it even better is if you added when concerts of your favorite bands are playing it would help people so much!  And you would get less complaints about the ads!  Hope you consider my idea thanks!"

47565,"Spotify",2014-10-26,3,"Okay, I guess...   Was very thrilled when I saw that Spotify had been made for a tablet, so I logged in on my Spotify account from my school laptop and saw all my music was there, but now that it has been a few days, it is being very annoying. You can't play music unless in shuffle mode. Unless you are tolerant of nonsense like this, this app is not for you."

47581,"Spotify",2016-06-19,5,"Best Music App!   I practically depend on this app for my daily music needs, I am band trash (think of that what you may because I just went to emøtiønal røad shøw yesterday (June 18, 2016)) so hehe.  But this app is absolutely amazing, waay better than apple music which is just a more expensive copy of spotify, spotify is free unless you want premium, but if you don't have premium and you play mudic on shuffle it actually gives good recommendations for songs, for example if you're listening to toxic by britney spears because you like that song or like me are in the phandom or something they won't play like my chemical romance after, they will reccomend like a song similar to toxic.  I'm awkward just get the app."

47588,"Spotify",2014-11-08,5,"Love Spotify but...   Spotify is arguably one of the best things that ever happened for music listeners and one of the worst for music artists. Artists make next to nothing. We're talking 1/100 of one cent per listen. Do the math and tell me how anyone can live off that. The only artists who can survive are superstars who make all their money from touring."

47653,"Spotify",2015-06-27,3,"Good but..   I really love this app. It's so easy to find the songs that you want. One thing I dislike is that you need internet to listen to the music. Some of us want to listen without wi-fi but Spotify doesn't let you. I wouldn't recommend if you are going on a camping trip or something."
47661,"Spotify",2016-09-22,5,"Pretty good   I like this music app because it gives me a greater variety of what to listen to and on premium I don't even need Internet connection to play all my favorite Playlists"

47669,"Spotify",2016-06-29,3,"not eligible to purchase this app due to geographical restrictions   Latest update is no longer available in Malaysia. Spotify is available in Malaysia, I have a premium subscription with them through my telco, and I can get the latest versions on my other Android and iOS tablets. However on my Blackberry Passport and LeapFrog Epic who can only get apps from the Amazon AppStore, Amazon is denying me the ability to download the update. Very disappointed. I've already contacted Amazon Customer Service and they told me to contact Spotify, who is appearing to be clueless as to what has happened.I'd have given it 5 stars, but denying me off the update, even for something I'm paying monthly for, is just plain wrong."

On my old kindle, it was amazing, but I recently got a new one and I immediately downloaded this app. But, when I downloaded it, I only got a limited amount of skips like I was on Pandora, and I can't choose to play a specific song. It bums me out."

Just wish I could get free music on my ipod shuffle, since that's what I use to keep me motivated when doing chores or exercising at the gym.  I even found a country song from the 80s I'd been wanting to hear for a long time, so this app doesn't just have ""new music""."
47710,"Spotify",2017-06-21,5,"Thanks !   I prefer to use this app than others! This is much better then my previous music app."
47715,"Spotify",2015-10-05,5,"I Quite Enjoy It!   You will have a good time with Spotify. You CAN use it, fee free, however Premium is the best. Whatever else you are paying for, each month, make room for this service. All the music you want, when you want it with no library to worry over. Cheers!"

But there is a reason why I can't give it four stars. You can't change the song. You need a payed membership to pick certain songs and skip them, otherwise it's just placed on shuffle. Other than that though, I love it!"
47793,"Spotify",2016-05-03,5,"Music on Demand   I love being able to listen to all different types of music whenever I want to and to find music to fit every mood.  Spotify allows me to do that and for that reason, I give Spotify 5 stars."
47795,"Spotify",2017-06-07,5,"Lots of music available for your listening pleasure   This app seems amazing. However, I wonder whether artists are compensated properly. Ads are really not very intrusive. But why is there not under Amazon apps the opportunity to pay the .99 cents as a form of upgrade like with some other apps. In addition I have wondered why Amazon has changed things with regards to music. Now if I go straight to Music - Store, all I get is Prime listening stuff. I do not want to pay $10.00 a month just for listening to some music. I do like to buy tracks or CDs if I like them. I discovered one can go straight to ""shop"" and then one still has the ability to sample the tracks, or put a CD or track on your Carousel and then when they suggest other music you still can sample some tracks. I used to love  the radio app Tune-In but they also changed things and truly I wonder why. Now I no longer like that one. If something is good, please leave it alone."

47870,"Spotify",2016-07-07,4,"It's Pretty Great!   This app is really good for listening to music and the sound quality is good. I just wish they had more of Taylor Swift and other artists. Also at this point my spotify/kindle has glitches and I can't pull down the top of my screen and see the Spotify tab to skip forward and/or back. Other than that, this is a great app! However, when the trailer for “ The Visit "" came out, Spotify kept playing that trailer and it freaked me out. But just get premium if that's a problem. They have really great deals. So I would highly recommend this app for all the music lovers. ( LIKE MEH!!! ) 🎆🎆🎆"

47905,"Spotify",2015-10-29,5,"Impressive selection!   All my favorite classic Brazilian bossa nova and jazz are there. The groups and sub-groups are very helpful. Amazing selection and the audio is really good if you use quality headphones. (I am using this app on a Kindle Fire)."

Sometimes i have to do this several times in a week. Aside from that, it's amazing!"
47915,"Spotify",2015-07-03,2,"Free for 30 days.   I got a sample, was pretty happy. The time ran out so thought I would join. No way,no how. Aggravated me so kept try.

48064,"Spotify",2014-08-09,5,"just my thoughts   I absolutely love this app there wasn't a song that I looked for that I couldn't find. It even finds the album that the song came from. You can even save the whole album itself  if you wanted too. I even created a slow jams play list  and I love it cause it's a combination of old and new songs it's a perfect blend."
48070,"Spotify",2017-04-02,4,"Great music app   Great to use, make a playlist of all of your favorite songs!"

48103,"Spotify",2015-10-26,2,"Something to Fix?   Spotify is great in the sense that you can make your own playlists, however, you should be able to choose the song you want to listen to instead of having to shuffle and hope you get the song you want to listen to."

48172,"Spotify",2016-12-25,3,"Okay, getting better.   I mostly listen to classical, 19th century popular music, and jazz. The selection is good enough that I rarely listen to my CD collection anymore. But the computer app for my iMac, running the latest OS, is a memory hog. I find the interface to be cluttered. The ability to order & retrieve saved albums is not very flexible. I will note, however, that the interface is constantly being improved - it's better now than when I first bought it.And Spotify really ought to figure out how to set up a tip jar for the artists."
48183,"Spotify",2017-05-25,5,"Meditative   Great easy listening music. Helps me meditate and pray."
48185,"Spotify",2017-08-07,5,"Why I use Spotify!!   Spotify rocks!! I will never bother with anyone else. Simple to use.  All your information is private and safe."

48201,"Spotify",2015-02-23,5,"Love me some Spotify.   This is by far my most important app. I BlueTooth it at work off the company's WiFi. I use it at home off of my WiFi. I just bought a new car and it has BlueTooth. I put all my songs on 'available offline' and now the car rocks with Spotify. Essential app I tell ya!"
48202,"Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"love the free version   I've never paid for spotify so my one and only gripe is that it sucks the life out of my data plan... I'm not sure if paying for it would solve that issue but if $10/month would do it, I'd start tomorrow! As long as you expect ads, this is the best free music server out there."
48203,"Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"Great app   Easily giving Spotify 5 stars because I have it on all my devices and it has never disappointed me👌👌👍👍👏👏"
48204,"Spotify",2014-12-27,4,"pretty good   It is pretty good but there are a few cons one is that you need a premium membership to use it with out Wi-Fi and there's WAY too many ads and one more is that you need too search for a lot of the music and you can't change your username. Please look at this before you get it."
48208,"Spotify",2016-02-15,5,"Great Resource.   I love the variety of music available here. I can find almost anything here, whether current or recorded in 1920. This is byFar the most comprehensive source of recorded music."

48233,"Spotify",2015-01-19,5,"Wonderful App   Very easy to use and in my opinion better than Pandora if you have particular artists or albums you want to listen to. I use this with the Bluetooth feature on my kindle fire to listen to high quality music on my home stereo. I wish I would have downloaded this sooner."
48238,"Spotify",2015-01-13,5,"amazing!   This app is a godsend. I can listen to any song I think of, without having to buy it or wait for it to play on Pandora on some radio.

48247,"Spotify",2014-12-28,4,"Almost perfect. There are some minor organizational problems that prevent ...   Almost perfect. There are some minor organizational problems that prevent 5 stars. Things that you can do on your pc but not tablet, like rearrange your downloaded playlists by artist for example. It can be annoying when try ing to find that one song in a list of hundreds."
48250,"Spotify",2016-03-06,4,"Best service, but acceptable app.   An excelent service but the app must need improvement (don't have many play options, is hard to find the playlists, the options buttons are too small, and a few more things)."

48269,"Spotify",2015-09-12,4,"Great app! I love using it for my music!   I love using Spotify! Even though I don't have the premium yet, it's still great when you're using the free version. The only downside is not being able to save music for offline use, otherwise I would use this 24/7"

Also new music comes in frequently. Its something you truely have to get to understand and apperciate how awesome it is. Also it is completely free of charge unless you go premium, which turns off ads and lets you listen offline. You can even listen to music as you read or play games or whatever you do on your mobile device. Way better than Pandora or other music services like that.

48598,"Spotify",2017-04-20,4,"Great but...   This app offers you a huge selection of music for all tastes, but if you don't have the premium account you have ads. Whenever the ads come on they either get stuck and I have to press pause which means I have to get up or out of the shower and take care of it. Or the ad video gets stuck and the time keeps going and once the time runs out everything stops and the only way I've figured out to fix it is by deleting the app, downloading it again, and logging back in. This may not seem like a big deal but it frequently is happening now which is making it a huge inconvenience for me."

49735,"Spotify",2015-03-09,3,"spotify for fire phone   It's nice to have an app, but the web player seems to work better. Also, on the web I don't have ads due to spotify rewarding me for helping with bug fixes or being member since prebeta, or something. It wasn't really specified as to why I shouldn't have ads with my account, but I still get th on mobile app.  Another issue is that I can't find an option to use better sound quality when on WiFi. I get the crap audio on 4g eating up my data cap, but I have a nice phone and would like better quality music when it's viable through high-speed internet.  The app kinda sucks, and the web player still seems to be the best option across most platforms, but at least they thought of us Amazon users."

Most of the music I currently enjoy and hundreds of songs I loved as a much younger person are available to add to playlists and enjoy.

50400,"Spotify",2014-09-03,5,"Spotify is the gift of music in its entirety   I grew up with a turntable, reel to reel tape and AM radio, then marveled when FM and cassette tapes rocked my world with improved sound and portability.  CDs upped the ante.  MP3s, portable digital players and satellite radio further extended content and quality.  Then something wonderful happened and changed everything: enter Spotify.Spotify’s paid subscription delivers ad-free all you can eat music with every song you can think of and access to every genre old and new.  Combine that with phenomenal quality and universal streaming access via any smart device – PC, smart TV, streaming media player, tablet and smartphone – and musical nirvana is mine.In practice, Spotify can be quite daunting.  What genre, group, album or song would I like to listen to now or download to my device for later?  Spotify makes answering this question easier with options for matching your mood or activity with playlists supplied by Spotify experts and other users as well as searching and browsing tools that deliver clear results with helpful, relevant recommendations.The Spotify experience plays out differently across each of my typical use cases – desktop PC with near-field monitor speakers, tablet with Bluetooth connection to living room home theater sound system and smartphone with Bluetooth connection to car stereo or wireless headphones – but each one delivers exceptional results.Frankly, exploring Spotify on a 24 inch desktop computer display and hearing the results on studio-quality monitors pointed at each ear is thrilling.  This is where I can truly grasp even the finest musical nuances and how I can accurately judge Spotify’s streaming media as excellent.Spotify on my 8.9 inch Kindle HD adds a novel musical dimension to sitting on the living room couch or hanging in the kitchen with family and friends, enabling one and all to queue their favorites, contributing background or central focus for conversation.  Handing the Bluetooth connected tablet to a newcomer often requires a few moments for instruction on finding and queueing tunes that benefit from my home theater’s surround sound with subwoofer speakers.  Recently, I introduced a friend with a room-sized, wall to wall audio collection to Spotify, who said this tablet solution could, should and would replace his shelves and stacks with instant musical gratification.Smartphone Spotify brings an endless mobile musical mix to the gym and in the car.  In both cases, I typically rely on a quick search for a favorite group or mood-matching playlist, then get moving.  My Bluetooth headset’s controls make it easy to pause, skip or replay tunes playing on the Spotify app without touching my phone.  On the road with my smartphone connected to the car stereo via Bluetooth, the Spotify app’s big Shuffle Play button makes moving past less desired tracks effortless while maintaining the spontaneity akin to broadcast radio.While all these options for consuming music are first rate, the most important service feature remains Spotify’s monumental breadth and scope.  The collection offered by Spotify fulfills my dual desires for deep diving in my musical past as well as expanding my horizons."

I'm NOT the one to be rating this app.  I'm so bent on preserving cell phone battery power that I find it hard to sit back and enjoy the tunes.  In fact I've only used the app once, the day it was downloaded.So far... I've only one band that I've clicked to follow.  MUSE.  The evening the app was downloaded into my phone I did enjoy the shuffling of the different MUSE songs.  The few advertisements played through without me really noticing them. (SORRY Ad Agencies)  So it's just kinda like a radio station that plays only one group.  hahaha.  Though, I'm sure that will change as soon as more groups are listed in my favorites.There wasn't any stuttering effect or pauses due to band width issues.  And sounded pretty good with earphones on.  So with my limited knowledge of these things, take this 5 star rating with a grain of salt."

53304,"Spotify",2014-08-14,4,"The sound quality is great (not excellent   I use this on a daily basis. The sound quality is great (not excellent, but still a nice quality sound for most songs). There are very few songs I have not been able to find on Spotify, and I suspect that has something to do with the individual artists' licensing agreements. Unlike other music services, I don't have to listen to any songs I don't want to, and when using the non-mobile version, there are no limits to the number of times I can skip songs. I merely have to listen to a short (around 30 seconds) advertisement after a number of skips and after listening to a number of songs.The drawbacks are that some songs are not available, and you are limited to the number of skips in an hour on the free version of the mobile app. If you want to use the mobile app, you are better off paying for the membership due to the limits on what is available to listen to on a mobile device, and that even includes iPads and tablets. Still, if you are using a laptop or desktop, it is probably the best free music app available at this time, and you can't beat the price."

53360,"Spotify",2014-09-15,5,"Spotify Is Great!   Very great source for music and programming to listen to while you're at home or on the go.  I do recommend that you use this only at home since it might run up your limited data plan.  The sound quality is above CD quality and the service has a very good library.  It beats filling up your phone with songs and ending up running out of space.  Spotify does not have everything and sometimes they limit what you can listen to based where you are located because of those copyrights.  I have the premium subscription because I hate the commercials in the middle of the listening sessions."

I don't think the television has even been turned on since getting this music app.  It must be relatively simple to use because I have gotten it to work amazingly well.  Since it is Christmas time, it has been tuned to Christmas radio and albums.  Very nice.  Mannheim Steamroller is playing right now.  One thing I don't understand is how this service is available for free.  It does have a few commercials, VERY few.  It just doesn't make any sense to me, but I'm not complaining.  Really nice service or app or whatever you call it.  I think it's great!!!"

55359,"Spotify",2016-01-11,5,"A Rich Musical Experience   Spotify is my go-to streaming app because not only does it allow me to listen to all of my favorites, but it also allows me to personally experience music in a much richer way. I can find music by mood or era, and discover gems I would have never come across by just a simple search. The feature of following other members' extensive playlists is a great way to reconnect with music that has been forgotten over the years. Spotify isn't just a steaming app. It's an experience for a musical connection that I haven't found anywhere else."

55867,"Spotify",2014-10-23,5,"this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music. I can spend hours a day creating ...   Spotify is truly a unique app in how it not only offers a variety of music, but allows you to personally choose/create your own playlists.  Unlike other music services, this one allows you to search and download your own favourite music.  I can spend hours a day creating different playlists which help make the work day or study time go by quick.  If you enjoy creating your own playlists then this app is for you.  If you choose the free version, there are commercials and you are only able to shuffle your playlists.  Should you choose the paid version, then it is basically like putting in a cd and hitting play, skip, stop, etc.  (I recommend the paid version) If you are a student, there is a student discount basically cutting the month subscription price in half.Happy Listening Spotifyers!Cheers!"

55878,"Spotify",2014-09-25,5,"Best music app ever.   Spotify is amazing. I use this app every single day and I love making various playlists of my favorite musicians and artists. I also love that I can find new music and bands within the same genres, which has turned me on to new music and indie artists that I never would have known about without Spotify. Now I can support these artists by buying merchandise, CDs and going to their concerts. Another cool feature is that you can listen to music offline by downloading the songs to your PC. This means that you can download music to your device at ho,e using your WiFi instead of using up all of your mobile data streaming the songs when you are out. You have to get this app. Spotify rules. It is ABSOLUTELY WORTH GETTING A PRO SUBSCRIPTION!!! It is $9.99 a month, but it is worth it. SPend the money!!! You will not regret it."

Here's how I'll put it: Spotify makes me feel rich because l have access to almost all the music that l can ""think of."" And the best part is the cost: which is free. Love it when l (and you) win as we do with this app. I wish most other ""basics"" were just like Spotify! Perhaps a day will come (sooner than later) that disrupt things so that life become an affordable luxury --as Spotify has done for music! Great app!"

You can create your own playlists or choose from many already set up. Spotify can be used in your computer with no loss of selections made. There are 30 second commercials. There is a prime version that is commercial free.  I find it easier to set up playlists and albums to listen to on my computer. Not certain about battery drain, it seems the steaming audio could use up battery life rather quickly. I have been using Spotify on my computer for several years and am happy to have a portable version available."

There is just one minor problem, their music library is somewhat lacking. Don't take it the wrong way, they have tons of songs and such, but some of the things they call singles are actually quite large albums. I don't appreciate it when I find a song on something like Pandora and want to listen to it again, only to find the album on Spotify has every song except the one I am looking for. Other then that, it's a good music app."

I love the ability to create different playlists. I also love the radio feature (you can create a custom radio station around almost any artist or song) and the ability to customize your radio by giving songs a thumbs up or down.We also have Bluetooth support in our car radio and often use it to sync our phones and listen to Spotify while riding/driving. The ads can be a little annoying at times, but I understand they have to make money somehow. You usually hear an ad every 3-4 songs."

You can play it, but it doesn't stop when you switch to another screen. Even when your kindle is off. You can easily play/pause. Thank you, spotify. So muchSincerely, A.A (my initials) ;)"

57086,"Spotify",2015-07-13,5,"Five Stars   Really good"
57091,"Spotify",2014-11-23,2,"Good, but I'm not paying.   I have loved Spotify to death on my laptop, (750+ song on several playlists that I use a lot) but the tablet/phone version is terrible. There are ways to get around the shuffle limitation (really, Spotify? Really?) but I shouldn't have to deal with that. I realize that I'm not paying, but I shouldn't have to be. Spotify is not a radio app and should not ever act like one. It downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD, synced up my music beautifully once logged in, and as always most of the music I could ever want. I don't mind the ads, that's what premium is for. But again, the shuffle-only issue, and it refused to sync again to accommodate the playlist changes I made online, and said 'no internet connection' even when I had WiFi and my other apps had no problem with the WiFi. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled, but this time I got a different Spotify, even though it was the same app in the store. I think it was the premium version even though I never knowingly paid. It was fantastic - but I'm worried they might have charged me, so I uninstalled. It may have been some kind if free trial, but when I first reinstalled it told me there was a payment issue in the store, so I just tried again. If they charge me, I will raise hell, but as usual Spotify is (in my experience) an amazing app."

57891,"Spotify",2016-03-14,5,"ROBUST!!!   This app is basically the NEW Pandora. I recommend you to use this music app. Trust me you'll love this app, so I encourage you to switch to Spotify. It`s an incredible app, especially if you have a premium account. There`s an immense number of selections to pick from; pop, latino, rock, country and so on. Another thing you can do if your a premium user is skip songs an infinite number of times, and pick the song your heart desires to hear.There's a number of things you can do. If you're a music lover I totally recommend this app to you. Even if you're not a premium user you'll automatically fall in love with this app, you'll be blinded by your love for music. Likewise, you'll be attached to it.The only difference of not being a premium user is not having the freedom to skip songs, and make your own selection of music. Otherwise it's beyond phenomenal."

58307,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best Music App Out There For Streams!   Spotify is my main source of music. It is available on every device including Roku, and has the ability to put together play lists. I used to download mp3s and it took hours of my life transferring them onto devices or cds. I had to pick one track out of entire albums constantly, and it was a pain. I am an early adopter of Spotify and the Internet in general. I remember when Yahoo Music came out. I was there for the controversial Napster, and the embracing of mp3 as a legal format to sell albums on iTunes.Spotify could stand to give a bit more back to artists, but I love I pay a monthly fee and can support musicians just by listening as usual. I love it has a high quality play back mode and an offline mode for when you lose service. I still think it's important to purchase music, but as a culture streaming will be vital to the new model being built in the music industry.Spotify links to last.fm accounts for charting your music,  you can add local files to it, and it has great Playlist choices, recommendations from friends, stations, and more. If you're a music lover you will love this app as you have much more control over what you listen to, and is great at helping you discover new music! While supporting artists.I highly recommend to anyone who doesn't already have Spotify. It's my daily driver, my go to, my happy place. I've been using it since it came out and I am ever grateful for it in my life. I just upgraded to a family plan so everyone can enjoy and make their own play lists.I'd also like to add the app is smart. If you have it running at home the  use it on your device it will switch to the new device seamlessly. Pretty cool right?I think so!"

For example, when I'm trying to add a mass amount of songs to a playlist, it's very time consuming. Maybe you could add a select button so that we could select many songs at once, and then it would be easier to add to playlists. Another thing you could add, is making it so you could see how many songs you have all together, and not just in the playlistsThanks"

58687,"Spotify",2015-09-09,3,"It was GREEEAT ...before the update ):   It was perfect .... before the update.Before: You could select whatever song you WANTED to play without having to put shuffle play and either wait for it to play or keep skipping until you get the song. (Though if you kept skipping chances are that you get an advertisement) Also, you were able to see the songs that were coming on next.After (now): You cannot select whatever song you want to play. Which REALLY sucks. I always loved Spotify on kindle because you could pick a song. Now you can't put songs on queue or see what songs are going to play next. I always liked looking at the songs coming on next.The update was just today. (9/9/15) I feel so upset.*The only thing that kept the same THANKFULLY is the ability to replay ONE song over and over again.I want to kinda give up Spotify and just have Pandora since Spotify isn't very useful and takes up sooo much space. But I have some very good playlists.I'm so very unhappy. I understand why they might have done that however I can't afford premium. It's not worth it. ):"

58706,"Spotify",2016-12-25,5,"Why havent u subscribed to Premium yet! Go do it! 😎   Spotify I feel is the best music app period. 1 being is that your not stuck having to listen to already programmed stations or set music/song lists. You can actually download full albums of literally who or whatever pops in your mind, and not just stuck to others options for music. I mean let's face it, were all different and Spotify definitely enforces that right to hear, listen, share and dance to any genre of music you or others are feeling at the moment. Another cool feature Spotify offers with having a premium account is another plan, such as the Family Plan. Yet again Spotify has personalized in so many ways to fit each person with there own individual preferences! Boom!"

58770,"Spotify",2016-03-22,3,"angel.goins👅👅   I think they could do better.They should give us a month a free music before we decide.😕Why get something without nowing if it is worth it.It say it takes no internet and WiFi but they lied unless you pay for it.I like the songs on Spotify.They are a good website.I will not lie about that.And we should not have to sign up and you should not have to be a sertine age.That is just meen to like kids.😫Why"
58773,"Spotify",2017-04-06,5,"An able app   Ease of use great library"
58778,"Spotify",2017-08-12,2,"Internal error   The app would not work on my Samsung S6 edge +.It loaded with no problem but when I tried to start it it gave me an internal error and wouldn't run. I would like to use it but can't."
58786,"Spotify",2016-06-04,5,"Love it!   I honestly love this application so much. In my opinion, it's the best one out there. Although there are a few artists and songs that I can't find on this platform, on the whole it's easy to create playlists, follow your favorite artists, and stream music. Amazing for any music lover."
58788,"Spotify",2016-08-05,5,"Perfect song app   You can find just about any song that you can imagine. Rock, rap, metal, edm, it's all here. Great loading times on the kindle. Just a few ads for non premium users, but it's more than worth it for freedom in your music. A must download for any human that likes music."
58791,"Spotify",2015-07-24,5,"Best Music Streaming Service!   Spotify is my favorite streaming service for music and prefer this over Pandora any day, you can listen to full albums (heck, even complete discographies if you feel so inclined to!) from all your favorite artists / bands!If you buy the Spotify Premium Service, you're able to listen to your music - commercial free."
58792,"Spotify",2016-11-12,5,"Absolutely love this app   I've used a lot of music apps over the years but I've never found one as great as Spotify and I loved the app so much I even upgraded to the Student Premium which is even better. And for $4.99 a month you can't beat the price or the quality."
58799,"Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Stream vs Storage.   I used to be an avid fan of keeping recordings in my collections. I was constantly finding songs I wanted either they didn't have it available or you had to buy an entire album just to get one song. 99c to $1.29 adds up quick when you build up a collection. For this rate a month I don't need to keep all the overhead and I stream a lot. Only been twice I couldn't find something on Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't find it anywhere else either. They got pretty much everything ever recorded. You can stremit any tie you want and it's made more portable than carrying around CD's and ruining them or losing them."

58814,"Spotify",2014-06-18,5,"woohoo!   I started using spotify on the computer and now I have it of all of my devices. I would reccomend it to anyone that loves music."
58816,"Spotify",2016-11-26,5,"aetao25's review   It is perfect to sit down, relax, and listen to your favorite songs! You can find your friends profile or albums and follow them! You can even follow your favorite artists and their albums of to listen to!"
58820,"Spotify",2017-03-20,5,"Awesome!   This app is amazing it let's you play music while shutting off your device or playing a different app! Wow I've never had a app this good in my whole life, I'm never uninstalling hthis!!"
58823,"Spotify",2015-10-19,3,"Uh...   This app was great, we all know it.But suddenly, out of the blue, came an update.Because I hadn't updated the app, it was pretty glitchy. Due to that, I updated it. Now, whenever I play music and swap to another app, it crashes. The music COMPLETELY STOPS. Before the most recent update came out, it was FINE.Because of this, I would rate it one star- but I'm not going to, because this app has great potential and on all my other devices it works quite well.I would recommend this app, but they should really fix the bugs in the next update!!!"
58825,"Spotify",2016-06-12,5,"omg   Best app ever I love it u can listen to the music easily and quickly and Iove how u can make ur own play list but I wish it was for free for u to listen to it out side with no wifi for free but I loveee itt !!!!"

58838,"Spotify",2016-09-04,4,"4-Stars   I gave this 4 stars for one reason - There are times when I'm listening to a song and then out of the blue - it just cuts off. Why does this happen? I can be enjoying a real good song that I added to my up next listen and minutes later, it just shifts songs, without notice. Really annoying! Over all, I love spotify. Fix this problem and I'll be golden. :)"
58841,"Spotify",2016-09-02,5,"Game changer for music lovers   My family really enjoys this app. In fact, we made it our default music app on our Echo and listen even more than befo'. Get the family subscription and !ore than 1 can listen at a time without commercials"
58842,"Spotify",2014-12-25,4,"Great App!   Love this app. Much better than Pandora in my opinion, because you can make your own playlist, with your favorite songs. Only fault is that you have to buy a Premium if you want to be able to play certain songs when you want. You can only shuffle otherwise. You have a limited amount of skips, but more, it seems, than Pandora. They have all the songs I want. Even the most  unknown to the people around me. Over all, a really fantastic app.Update: There was an update on my Kindle Fire HD, and now I can pick whatever songs I want to play whenever I want to play them."
58846,"Spotify",2015-03-04,2,"Meh..   Something is very wrong with this app, it wants to reinstall itself everytime I open it, it's very slow at loading my music and I only have maybe a 1/20th of the amount I wanted to have, offline mode is kinda cool but still slow. And to top it all off, I made a new facebook and I had my spotify set up through my original account, so everytime I deactivated my original and opened spotify, it'd reactivate my account. But the kicker is I can't switch payment plans to another account so it's stuck on that until I get rid of spotify, which will probably be soon."

58855,"Spotify",2015-01-02,2,"um ... well   Well sometimes I will go on it and it never loads. What I mean by this is that I only get a gray screen . Also sometimes there are ads that I Don't mind but they pause and can't play so This means no music . Now back to that gray screen .  .  . I have tried everything even deleting it then downloading the app again . Now the music is great and all . If you like rock like me then listen to linkin park (in the end , numb,and no more sorrow ) you also need to listen to headstrong . These songs are rock songs so listen to them if your into rock ."
58857,"Spotify",2014-06-24,4,"Super   Love it!!!  Just wish that I could afford a newer iPod so that I could listen on it.  Have suggested it to a couple friends that didn't know about it."
58860,"Spotify",2016-12-26,3,"Really???!!!   I was really excited about this I had downloaded many stations and songs then one day I was going to listen to it while offline and ALL of my music was gone! I tried to re download the music and it said things like sorry you can't get this. I still have it but I'm really disappointed that this happened Fix it soon or I'll get rid of it and I really don't want to because I like it but if you don't fix it's gonna go :/"
58867,"Spotify",2016-04-11,5,"Spotify is spot on   I love spotify.  It's the best music app and I've searched high and low!"
58868,"Spotify",2014-07-31,5,"Best Music App ever.   This is literally the only app that you can listen to any music you want for free. It's beautiful, chic and it has great sound quality.ignore old review of this, it now allows you to listen to any of their music for completely free. You still have ads, but they're not very common. Also it's has great connection to social media and it even outlets to shazam so you can find the song you want and listen to it automatically.Save your troubles with any other music app this is the best decision you'll ever make."
58875,"Spotify",2015-09-15,3,"I love the app but...   I am in love with Spotify, but ever since there are two problems I with the new update:1) You can no longer choose a certain song, you must always click the shuffle button and skip untill you find the song you want to hear.2) If you are listening your own playlist, the app now adds recommended songs on there too.Honestly, I think this made the app a lot less enjoyable, and I find it annoying.  I think if they want to recommend you songs, they should e-mail you them like the old way."
58876,"Spotify",2015-09-25,3,"Love spotify, but app needs work   The app regularity &#34;skips&#34;, similar to like what would happen if you bump a CD player.  It doesn't cause the app to lock up or anything, but is annoying none the less.  This happens in offline mode so it isn't caused by an unreliable network connection.  This is on a fire phone."
58877,"Spotify",2017-02-21,5,"Crazy Song app   Ok so before I start blabbing. This App is crazy amazing. You can search all songs you want. I have to say this but this better than sound cloud SERIOUSLY. But the only down side is that You need the premium virsion. But anyway get app they did not pay me too say that."
58878,"Spotify",2014-06-25,5,"I always use this app!   I was looking for good music apps and I don't really like pandora...it doesn't have enough skips and u don't know what song is going to go on. Then my brother said spotify was good. So I got the app and it has like every song I like on it!! I use this everyday!! I would rate this 10 stars if I could!"
58879,"Spotify",2017-03-21,5,"Completely blew my mind! { Please read my Review }   I got Spotify a couple years ago. I do not have Premium, (for those of you who don't know what that is, it is the version of Spotify that you pay for.)  However even without Premium, Spotify is an all around amazing music app! I have never really had any trouble with it, and it plays all of my music like a breeze. I happen to have gotten Spotify when it wasn't really a big music app, and even then it worked great! It updates every now and then and makes it better pretty much every time. I would highly recommend this incredible app, especially to music lovers that just need a good music app. It has a lot of features including, following music artists, creating your own playlists, picking who you want to listen to, and you can also go to the ""Browse"" section and from there pick from a lot of genres and even sleeping sounds to help you sleep. There are radio stations to listen to as well. Great app! I would say the best ages that should get this app are, 11 and up. Depending. I love Spotify and if you get it,  (which you should) then you will too! Thank you for reading this I hope I helped you make a decision on whether or not to get this amazing app."

58886,"Spotify",2014-11-23,2,"They pissed  me off!   This app is great but my favorite artist was taken down, like all of her good country songs and now they only have her stupid pop songs. I need my Taylor swift back!"

One thing is, the songs that have curse words in them say it and they don't block it out, so I wouldn't pick songs that have curse words in it. Good luck!"
58894,"Spotify",2015-10-02,2,"meh   Can only play shuffled. Can't just listen to an album from beginning to end. Ads are way too loud. Much louder than the music. I find myself ripping out my ear phones when an ad starts even though the music itself wasn't very loud."

58896,"Spotify",2014-07-23,2,"Free with a catch   GREAT if you don't mind NOT choosing your own songs even ones you own.  I find it annoying that you can't play a specific song unless you have a one song playlist and even then you get the crummy suggestion.I like Pandora better personally. I can at least listen to the one song I want to hear or someone else hear without issue. Spotify on the pc is the way to go.$10 a month premium is just too much would rather watch movies for that kind of money."

I can't count how many times I've listened to Hamilton on this, it has a little of everything and has playlists tFor what ever you may be doing, studying d wrong or even Podcats, after you find st a playlist of a track the app automatically plays a song related to the track you just listened to. This helps you discover new songs and artists you might like, they you would have never found othwise."

58910,"Spotify",2017-03-17,5,"BEST app for music   I can't even express how much I love this app. I've tried iheartradio, the Windows music thing, iTunes, and this, and Spotify is the best out of all of them. I had been using the Windows music thingy (I forget what it's called lol) but I needed an app for my kindle that does the same thing-- Spotify is that app, only its better than what I was using. You don't have to download the music-- it's all there in Spotify's massive library of songs, albums, artists, and more. You can create playlists, listen to songs, save music, and much more. Only on some occasions do you ever search for a song and see its not there-- about 98% of songs you search for are there. I found out about Spotify because my friend recommended it to me and at first I was a little skeptical because you have to sign up for it, but everything (even the deluxe albums) are still FREE. My dad asked me if it was legal because everything is free and yes, Spotify is 100% legit and legal-- they get there money from 30 second ads about every 15 songs or so. The only small error I ever encountered was sometimes it takes a minute to load, but that's probably just my old kindle. This app is also compatible with every single device I've ever used. Overall, I love this app and I hope you get it because it took me a long time to type this"
58912,"Spotify",2017-06-22,4,"Where's my song?   Specific song by Johnny Guitar Watson not in library of his works. I do like that you can download specific songs as opposed to entire album or having to create a station."
58915,"Spotify",2016-12-26,2,"No   This app does not letme listen to music the way I want to, unless I spend money."
58922,"Spotify",2015-09-11,4,"Pretty awesome app.   I am officially a hooked on Spotify listener/ user. I love the variations in stations, weather it be in genres or moods, Spotify has it ALL! I particularly like the Discovery Weekly playlist which stays in tuned with what you like listening to, keeps you up to speed with fresh music and a lil hint of older hits.Definitely recommend Spotify to others to experience, listen and enjoy its splendor! 😉🙌😁🎶🎵📻🎧"
58924,"Spotify",2014-06-19,5,"Spotify is Spot On!   Spotify was a good music app when it first appeared but has grown better and better!  The clincher for me was the ability to download my favorite songs and playlist to my various platforms, phone, tablet, ereader, computer and iTouch.  Wireless or phone data signal is not always available and knowing that I can still listen to the music that I want is very important to me.  Way to go Spotify, keep up the great work!"
58933,"Spotify",2016-08-28,4,"Great! But...   It's A Great And Wonderfully Helpful App, But I Wish It Had Way More Songs. Like, The Gypsy Bard? The One About Pinkie Pie??? Please Add It.

Now though the stupid thing will not let me chose a song unless I pay for it what the hell I am not dealing with this it I wanted a limited number of skips and to not be able to chose the song I would have use I heart radio or Pandora.

Honestly,it's too early for me to conclude anything about Spotify music except that I definitely don't like the commercials.  I'm already paying for Pandora One, and their price seems more reasonable.  I'm going to give this one a while longer at this time. Maybe I will change my mind."

Now let me just say if you're getting this application for your blackberry classic oh my god have I had the worst experience that I have ever had with an app. Don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure that it's my phone that makes it so slow and choppy and unsteady but this app sucks on blackberry classics. It works better on Passports. The experience I've had with this app is choppiness. Lag. freezes. crashes. unresponsiveness. It's just the worse. Spotify you guys have to make an application especially for Blackberries. Put it up on the BB world. Please. This sucks. And I'm a premium user for this s***? F that."

59102,"Spotify",2016-04-16,1,"Free app is useless   Best music streaming app if you're on premium. Worst app imaginable if you're on free subscription and a music lover who loves to listen to specific songs and artists. Someone like me. Even the most basic thing like choosing your own music isn't permitted, even on a limited basis. Not recommended if you aren't ready to spend $10/mo to go premium, which I find quite expensive, hence not an option for me at the moment. 1 star because there's no commamdable middle ground here, planned in a way to force users to go premium or stop using spotify altogether. 😔"
59103,"Spotify",2015-01-05,2,"Broken   Well this app started out working fine but now when ever I try and open it it automatically closes me out so I can't use the app any more."

59111,"Spotify",2016-08-06,5,"You get to create your playlists and aren't forced to listen to songs you don't like over and over again   Spotify lets you choose what songs you want to listen to. You get to create your playlists and aren't forced to listen to songs you don't like over and over again, like some other Radio Apps. The search engine is easy to use, and finding the artists you love, as well as obscure artists is a snap. I love this App and use it on my phone, computer (desktop), Kindle, laptop, and I even pipe it through the surround sound speakers via TV and PS4."

59224,"Spotify",2015-10-24,1,"Used to be a fantastic app, but now....   I used to love this, it was one of my favorite apps! Until it said it was 'Updated'. Is the update only being able to shuffle, and not being able to just tap on a song and play it?! If it is, then that's a stupid update. Or, it may be an update for other devices, but not Kindle Fires. I hope you can fix it, but until then I'm not playing it."

I was using the ""p"" service and it was ok.  But with Spotify I can make my own lists, as well as listen to radio.  Then I got premium!  Love this! No going back!  I can find 90 to 95% of what I want.  And with the Discover Weekly playlist I get 30 recommendations a week for my highly eclectic tastes.  Loving it!This was not a paid review!"

59278,"Spotify",2016-05-16,5,"It's Strength Is Its Library of Music   I'm two weeks into the free test drive of the premium website. The only reason I became interested in Spotify was that I bought an Amazon Echo. Although I have a Prime membership with Amazon, I found a lot of music I grew up with in the 60's wasn't available through Amazon Prime, but it was through Spotify.  (Of course, for what amounts to $120 per year for Spotify, I could probably buy a boatload of music on Amazon that's not available on Prime.)  Plus, Spotify has a lot of compilations of different kinds of music I like.  From reviews I read before uploading Spotify, it seemed like they were the premier site for a broad range of digital music, and that seems to be true."

59572,"Spotify",2016-09-22,4,"Absolutely awesome. Just two flaws..   Your search for a great app for music has ended! Spotify has thousands of songs to choose from. Two drawbacks is that if u have the kindle fire HD6, you won't have to web player option, that lets you choose whatever music you want just with ads. Then for the downgraded  devices, you don't have web player.I just make playlists of just one song so I can listen to whatever I want though, so it's no issue for me at all. Besides that, this app is great for all the people who need to listen to music ln a daily basis. On VERY rare occasion does it crash btw."

This is going to get out to people thinking of buying a kindle and once they hear about the spotify changes and if they use spotify religiously this is going to discourage them and that is going to mean way less sales of kindle`s and is going to make them choose a different device so good job Amazon for letting this happen."

Unless you pay the premium subscription, this app is nothing but terrible, the same commercial five times in a row every ten minutes, they say they give you 30 minutes ad free if you watch these long videos, but then they force you to listen to whatever garbage they want in order to continue listening to what you want. I only got it because the ps4 got it, but this is horrible."

59729,"Spotify",2016-06-21,1,"Unhappy Customer   I like spotify however I don't like how every option is blocked due to not having premium. I have suggestion that around certain holidays where spotify can be cheaper and have some months free. For example the the months for 99¢. I believe that this will ensure more customers and keep some coming back."

59738,"Spotify",2015-09-10,1,"used to be good.........   When I first got this app, it was a dream come true, being able to listen to any song whenever I wanted to (if I had WiFi) and the variety of the radio stations. But a few days ago, the app updated and I have no say in what I listen to unless you have premium and I'm forced to shuffle play but after 5 skips you can't skip anymore. Please fix this and convert back the original version of Spotify where you have the freedom to choose what you listen to and whenever you want to listen to it. Thank you for reading my review and I hope this helped you choose if you want the app or not."

If someone could help fix the issue or tell me now to uninstall this update that would be wonderful."

Every time I hit play it starts playing the ""recommended"" song which is nothing close to the song I chose.  To top it off I get at least one email a day attempting to sell me a premium membership.  I understand how spotty is supposed to work but my patients attempting to play my selection has worn thin and I will not continue with spotty. Prime music, songza, and my own library will be just fine."

So I'm like OK. So, one three-and-a-half song later, it says: Watch this short video to get 30 minutes of ad-free music and three more ads after that.  But it's still a good app because I can make playlists of my favorite songs."

I recently sold and bought a new tablet it took a few weeks to come in and of course I wanted spotify! So I logged in and was excited to see everything was still there! Here's where the crap comes in..I noticed I couldn't click on the song I wanted so I thought id just skip through shuffle to find it. Come to find out you can only get 5 skips and you can no longer listen to your songs on demand..This WAS my favorite app but now I see it as a glorified Pandora which angers me.....I suppose ill just use the radio..."

Id recommend other music apps before this one."

60034,"Spotify",2015-11-24,5,"Slick and Nearly Everything in Music ---Best Buy in Music   I listen to A LOT of music and a lot of it is alt-country, folk, and Americana. Other than purely local bands (and even some of them are here), Spotity has even some of the most obscure music I love.  It has way more than other subscription services I've tried.  The quality is fantastic. The only thing I would change is to provide other ways to organize music. I also find frustrating that what I listen to on one device is not saved to another.  I use a lot of devices - - two smartphones, a tablet,Chromebook, and two laptops. Unless I add what I'm listening to to a playlist, I won't find it on the next device I open. That device will have only the music I listened to on that device.  I also miss liner notesBut these are small points to what is otherwise a fairly priced service, at least for someone like me who listens a lot. The free service is fine for casual listeners who don't mind commercials  Hey, someone has to pay the bills.Subscription services are the future of music. My own vast collection of music is almost irrelevant. I choose albums I already own from Spotify because it's just more convenient.  I HOPE my favorite artists are adequately compensated when I listen to their music on Spotify. I just have no idea of the financials of this model. It certainly  works for major commercial artists, but that's not my scene. Are my favorites getting decent micro payments or would I be more supportive if I bought their CDs?  When I have bought CDs, I end up listening on Spotify. On the other hand, I still buy and listen to LPs and their is no digital substitute for them."

60042,"Spotify",2014-06-24,3,"Spotify as a User selectible music source - FREE version   Downloading to the Kindle Fire HD did not go well from the Spotify website.  Several attempts were necessary, possibly due to the screen size and location of data entry fields.  After installation I searched for and selected an album to listen to, but could not locate the play button; but a shuffle play button was available.  This started music but switched to a genre' format not allowing the songs from my selected album to be heard in order.  This may be fine at times for some users.  Odd that I did not see this limitation when downloaded to my WINDOWS 7 PC.  Like PANDORA, product adds will be heard after so many songs.  I have not tried the premium version of Spotify for the KINDLE FIRE / ANDROID / TABLET.  I may try downloading again to see if I missed something."

60077,"Spotify",2016-02-08,4,"Almost got it.  So close.  Mostly perfect.   Very ""manual transmission"" in design.  For some, this is a great thing.  You control EVERYTHING about your catalog, You can choose songs or albums to save.  I'm ambiguous on what ""follow""-ing an artist actually means... but whatever.For those that are stuck in automatic transmission mode (pick some thing and let it unfold how it wants), all this freedom can seem horrifying,  It took me a few days to re-adapt myself to the freedom that the app offered.No consideration is really given for what you already own.  This could be frustrating if it isn't considered that a person can arbitrarily add any single track (that the service is aware of) to the person's own catalog.For a person with a PC background, trying to add things (while the well behaved android thing runs) can be confusing/annoying.  This isn't a criticism of the app, which seems to do fairly expertly what it does... But, The ""Oh, ya.  There might be desktop users."" thing seems to be an afterthought.  This isn't a criticism of the app itself.  It can only do what it is programmed to do,  But, [desktop user manipulating user's library] seems to (unfortunately) be an afterthought at best.As to music sources, there's few things lacking as I can tell.  In particular (as of this date). Yanni - Optimystique seems to be absent, and to access the songs I remember I have to use ""Winter Light"" (a newer album/rehash, or whatever).  I can live with that."

60080,"Spotify",2014-06-22,5,"Nice Service   I like that there is an app for Kindle for Spotify because it is instantly addicting, not having to pick out songs to play yourself.

60082,"Spotify",2016-07-27,5,"Spotify   I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get this.  You don't even need premium (unless you want more songs).  This app is great for listing to a specific song any time you want."

60132,"Spotify",2017-08-22,4,"Awesome service if you don't mind the subscription fee. Music choice is pretty great   Comparing Spotify to what I consider its main competitor, Apple Music, there's really no clear winner. Both services have comparably sized music libraries, and each one has plenty of content that you won't find on the other. They're about the same price and have similar features such as radio stations (although Apple Music has stations with DJs if that's something you care about), hi-fi streaming, commercial free streaming, and so on. Apple Music's library appeals more to me personally, but the client absolutely does not.The iTunes desktop client for Windows is nothing short of horrific, and they're pretty much equally inconvenient to use on Linux. I've found that they work about equally as well on OS X. You can login to Spotify on as many devices as you'd like, where Apple Music can only be authorized on six devices at once. You can't stream from multiple devices at once with either service. The Android clients for both services are great, although buffering time occasionally seems a bit longer than necessary on Apple Music. Obscure music is equally sparse on both services, but different bands are available for streaming on each of them, so it's worth looking into what they offer. I ultimately switched from Spotify to Apple Music because of that."
60134,"Spotify",2016-08-06,4,"Music   They have great music and most of my favorite songs, I recently figured out that they don't have all of the panic! at the disco songs, and not all of a lot of other bands songs, I think they should work on getting all of a bands songs and not just half of them.

60152,"Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"I like it.   It's a pretty good app.  The suggestions are way more appropriate to my likes/dislikes than Pandora managed.  It is indeed spotty as far as internet connectivity (to their app alone; I could still reach the internet and other apps), and I spend half of my time on the app, waiting for it to load again.  But I can create playlists, which is a step up from many sites; not just ""I like this band, play me their channel and similar songs/artists"", but outright putting songs in order on a listing, with the capability to shuffle.As per usual with free radio sites, I couldn't find a few of the songs or artists I wanted, and annoyingly some songs only came as excerpts, like ""Lady of Shallot"", which has 5 versions on this site, none of which include the full song."

60172,"Spotify",2014-12-05,5,"Relevant Solution for Life   Spotify is the solution for keeping your music selection relevant throughtout you life. Allowing you a full musical experience in a very cost effective manner. Music is the background of life keeping us present. Let me tell you a quick story. When in my car with a nephew one afternoon I realized my music collection was so stale and outdated. An indicator part of me was stuck in the past and holding on to something. Like many of us, I had spent a lot of money on everything from albums, 8 track, cassetts and CD over the years. At some point that investment switched from buying to storing music. The cost of holding on to the past prevented me from experience the present. And takes me back to the beginning of my story. So my solution to keeping life's background revelation in a cost effective manner is SPOTIFY. And Spotify Connect allows me to stream Spotify thought out the home"

When i'm putting songs into categories or playlists, sometimes it switches to the Playlist i'm working on  - if i stay on it a second too long.  THEN when i go back to the Song List - it jumps up to the top of it (to the A's) and i have to find where i was before.  This happens a LOT and it's VERY annoying.I have found many 'songs' on Spotify that i have been looking for for a long time - so that is Great!!  The Classical lists are very good as i have found Augustin Hadelich whom i absolutely love.  It has music from the early 1900's - the 20's, 30's, 40's.  i have found most of the music i really love - BUT i can't find any good stuff of Bob Seger's or  solo by Eric Burdon which he has done lately.  i am frustrated over that.Spotify sound is fantastic even on my Macbook and iPhone regular speakers.I am really looking forward to getting the glitches fixed - and i still love iTunes (i'm sentimental :)"

Unlike leading music apps/radios, you can create playlists, listen to already made playlists, or, my favorite, just search up particular songs, artists, or genres. Usually, on Pandora our iHeart radio, you just listen to whatever is on a certain radio of your choice. After using this app, I have found absolutely every song I've looked for but one. It works great, but like all others, needs Wi-Fi or cell service. But it's still totally worth it. 5 stars!!!"

I have used it for about 2-3 years now and recently i have upgraded to premium to take away the ads (which are always funny and interesting) the only problem i have ever had with it is sometimes if you have your library saved offline to your phone it will un install all the songs forcing you to redownload them. Now this may only be a bug, and it has only happened to me twice in the past 6 months but it is kind of a pain. If they patch that bug then i will gladly give a 5 start review."

It will always be there.  Same goes with any othe playlists I create.  I still need to figure out how the folder system works and though I have the free version on my tablet the interruptions from ads are minimal.  I think $9.99 a month is a little over priced, since I could get Prime with all that comes with it for under $100.

60218,"Spotify",2017-10-15,5,"Just the Best Music App Ever!   I created a calm jazz playlist last night, and fell asleep to it.  Beautiful!!  My son and daughter used Spotify to create the playlist for their sister's wedding.  We linked it to our Church's PA and voila!  Beautiful wedding.  Great product!"
60227,"Spotify",2015-10-26,5,"I've had this for so long   I have had this for so long and it is amazing. I'm pretty sure everyone likes music so GET THIS! Free songs. If you get spotify premium you can listen ANYWHERE. Premium is only 10 bucks a month! For FREE SONGS! AMZING APP. LOVE IT!!!!!!! I would choose it over any music app other than Pandora they are both in first place. Cause with Pandora, I can find new songs to put on spotify!!! I also really recommend Pandora to spiritual lovers. ;&#62;"
60232,"Spotify",2016-11-17,3,"I'd give it 5 easily please read description.   I love this app and I'd give it 5 easily. Except for the last 6 hours or so I've been unable to use it. Claims its experiencing problems. Ive even uninstalled and reinstalled it. Started when my WiFi cut out.  I don't know what to do but I hope it clears up soon. I'm on a fire tablet and I'm NOT the most tech savy. Is anyone else experiencing this? I love that it creates radio stations based on your tastes. I love making playlists of what I like. And the service is free on my cell phone companies data plan. So all in all this app is awesome. Ive enjoyed its use faithfully for a long while. I only wished it had a alarm or a sleep thing on it. That'd be my only suggestion."
60233,"Spotify",2016-09-04,5,"Best music streaming service   Best streaming service yet.  Like that I can play full albums from bands.  Pandora isn't even in the same category... I like to chose what I'm listening to, and sometimes even want to hear a specific song... imagine that.  Spotify does that, and also has a huge number of 'radio' and playlists available if you don't feel like choosing everything."
60240,"Spotify",2017-05-20,5,"Same Great Design as Spotify on the Internet   I'm glad I can access Spotify on my Fire Tablet, I used to listen to it all the time at my old job. The quality is just like using it on a web browser, maybe with a few more ads here and there but nothing to complain about."
60249,"Spotify",2014-11-23,4,"Love it so far   After using this app for a year or so and loving it on my walks and work-outs, I finally caved in and went add-free. I am impressed! As we speak I am listening to Coffee Table Jazz -- which is one of the many Jazz and Blues stations. Anything you want you can find, whatever suits the mood. I'm sure I'm not using it to its fullest yet, so this gives me a whole new world of music to explore. Love it so far. (I haven't tried using it offline yet, but this was one of the main reasons I went Premium.)"
60254,"Spotify",2016-06-08,5,"Best app for music playing especially with student discount.   Don't waste time and money with any other music playing app. Does everything that Pandora does, apple music and more. Plus the interface looks cool. If you are a student, make sure you look for the student discount which was 50% of for me."
60255,"Spotify",2016-04-20,5,"I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon ...   I use Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and Amazon for my music. I think Spotify's algorithm will suit more people who may have slower speed internet access. Spotify also appears to use an automatic gain control, limiter, and compressor in its audio chain. The ""loudness"" is consistent. That is not the case with Pandora as volume levels tend to go and down."
60256,"Spotify",2016-04-21,5,"The Best Music Player!   Love Spotify more than any other music player thing out there. It's also way less expensive than other players and I can listen to pretty much anything I want, anytime I want. I love that and I don't have to listen to it in a station or anything like that. I can make my own playlists, which I love even more. I just can't say enough good things about this player. I love it so much!"
60260,"Spotify",2017-05-15,5,"Spotlfy Is Spot On!   I was using Pandora but for some reason started having problems accessing it so I decided to try Spotify. I'm really pleased with how many more songs there are with each artist, I prefer this to Pandora."
60263,"Spotify",2017-06-16,5,"THE BEST APP FOR MUSIC STREAMING❤   I love this app for music. You can make playlists with your favorite songs so they are easy to find and you don't even need to buy premium. You can play any song and they constantly update their songs and podcasts. It is easy to use and great if music is your life, like me. 😊"

60284,"Spotify",2017-08-23,5,"I think it's the best app for music   What can I say...it's Spotify. I think it's the best app for music. The only issue you'll have is if you don't download your playlist, and you lose cell reception."
60288,"Spotify",2014-09-28,4,"Beautiful, but hard to find lesser songs.   This app is incredible, and I highly recommend getting Premium as well. For 10 dollars a month you never need to buy another song again.That being said, I was heartbroken because I could not find my favorite song of all time: ""Starlight"" by Don Diablo and Matt Nash. This crushed me enough to give it a four star review. If you're into ultra-obscure music like me, this might not be the app for you. Give it a try, though. It's free!"
60291,"Spotify",2016-05-06,5,"Great app   Great! Easy to use, does all that it claims. There are some glitches in some tracks that I've downloaded, not so sure if that's DRM...not sure that it's worth the Premium if all downloads are glitchy. But streaming in my studio is wonderful."
60292,"Spotify",2017-02-06,4,"I love this app!   I love this app so much! It has all my favorite songs on it! But I have also realized that it also doesn't have a lot of songs, it plays adds a lot and sometimes after sayings after this add u get 30 minutes without adds.... Then after one song it plays an add. If they fix this I would give it 5 stars"

60299,"Spotify",2015-01-26,5,"Music you actually want to hear! Great App!   I love hearing music, whether I'm relaxing at home or working out,The problem with other music apps:1. You can't really choose the songs you want to listen to2. Even if you chose a specific station the music is way off3. Once you start liking songs, you only hear the same ones every time (Pandora mainly)With Spotify!1. You can look up songs: can find entire albums to listen2. Make your OWN Playlist that will shuffle3. Less advertising (up to 30 minutes of no ads)!4. Customizable but with variety- no more same old songs playing on repeat.If that's not great already their premium is a but pricy $10/month but completely worth it!(You can try their free trial and see what works for you!)Love this app I have no idea why I didn't find it sooner!  Plus you can download the app for free now on tablets and smart phones (not sure if it's always been that way though lol)"

It's been working for playing music without WiFi but then it stopped. Every time I try to listen to music without WiFi on my playlist it says ""you have discovered a premium activity"" or something like that but ya.I think I just have to update it so that's what I'm doing now. Let's see if it works. I hope so..."
60305,"Spotify",2015-08-02,5,"Great app, questionable ads   Spotify is wonderful, what would I do without it?  I use it in my art classroom while students work, and I listen to it while I work in my studio.  My only complaint is ads, I just wish they were a bit more edited for content as people of all ages listen to Spotify.  I had to stop using it for a while in class because there were Trojan ads on every hour, I really didn't want parent complaints."

60335,"Spotify",2014-12-09,4,"Internet Connection   The app is great, and I love how you can follow peoples, make your own playlists, have all of your songs in one place.... I love it. However, for some reason my Spotify has a glitch and it won't work for hours or even days at a time! It says I don't have internet connection, but I know I do because my internet works and any other games or apps I have that need internet access to works, even when this isn't. Also, there are other peoples in my house with Spotify, and it works well with them - except for a minor glitch such as mine. But besides that, it's a great app, and I think it is better than Pandora or I Heart Radio. Just giving my opinion. Thank you."
60339,"Spotify",2014-12-09,5,"BETTER THAN PANDORA AND I HEART RADIO!!   So much more enjoyable than those other music apps! I like how it's laid out and easy to use. I can find any song and it immediately plays; no waiting for ads! And I love creating my own playlists to fit my mood. If I'm feeling lazy, there's tons of prepared playlists to choose from. Like, those to fit my mood or one to get me pumped up to start doing the laundry.I'm sticking with Spotify and don't use any other music app."

So many choices of music, with lots of playlists for different occasions and moods, also you can generate your own playlists, you can also skip over songs without being penalized.  Spotify is the new ITunes, in my opinion.**"

I couldn't get past all the garbage that their software downloaded to my computer. And I used the software from their personal website. Then, they wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade and pay for it. This has cost me enough."

Off and on it took me three months to get it properly working on all my devices. Help is community based, which can be both a blessing and a curse. Obviously, I have mixed feelings about this app. However, it does have potential, and because of that I would give it a slight nod over its main rival, Pandora."

Spotify customizes multiple daily playlists based on the types of music you listen to. It also shows you concert tickets and newly realeased albums. My only criticism is that you want to listen to a certain song, download a song/playlist, or skip/go back then you have to pay. That's not a ridiculous asking price I'm just too cheap.  I thoroughly enjoy this app!"

Great Awesome!This is the best app ever!! I can't recommend Spotify enough. If I could give it 100 stars I would. With headphones the acoustics is awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. I can locate any song ever played and at it to my play list! The app doesn't drain the battery, user friendly:), and have very little if any commercials. I have tried quite a few music apps but after finding this gem I deleted all of the others. I play one song of my favorite artist/group and Spotify continues on with the songs from the same group/singer.Thanks Spotify!!"

60572,"Spotify",2015-01-09,5,"Kindle version is the best version of spotify, hands down   This app is BLEEPING awesome!! I am new to Spotify but I downloaded it on my WP8, my wife's android, my kindle, and on both my daughters' kindles.  While I'm sure I screwed up that sentence grammatically, it is far and away best on the kindle and it's not even close. On the kindle app, I can add songs to the queue, search much easier, find the artists that I follow and it is just plain easier to use."
60573,"Spotify",2017-08-25,4,"Great app for music.   Still working great for my BlackBerry  Passport. Recently updated the app and still my music companion. Just this app is a battery hog. Keep your phone on plug when using spotify."

60622,"Spotify",2017-02-04,4,"Good Value and Selections   Excellent music source... free platform commercials ARE mildy annoying.  Good value and a variety of playback methods.  Plenty of mainstream selections, some gaps (assume that's artist prerogative).  fairly comprehensive choices from emerging artists."
60624,"Spotify",2017-07-25,4,"Briliant search capability   Not only does this find thes song searched for, it finds every version of it. Thats great when you have time to review each version and select it into your playlist. In a party situation its too easy to put the wrong version into the queue. This is my only criticism . Its an excellent app."

60639,"Spotify",2016-12-22,5,"Used daily   I was very skeptical at first, I mean... Free music, really? But it's great! You have a unexplainably large selection of artists, albums, titles, and custom made stations and playlists. You can even make your own playlists! The only down side, and it is very, very minor, is the advertisements. You get an add after every 5-8 songs, which believe me, it's totally worth it! I highly recommend this app!"
60641,"Spotify",2017-03-25,5,"Five Stars   Love my Spotify Music had it for over 3 years"
60642,"Spotify",2016-12-30,5,"Awesome !!   I can't say enough about it. It works, has what I like and is easy to use. The commercials every 30 minutes are not a problem at all.

60700,"Spotify",2016-02-27,5,"Wonderful music app!   I switched from I heart Radio to Spotify at my boyfriend's suggestion, and I haven't gone back. I enjoy building my own library, and I've made and shared playlists with a couple of people. I also like that you can add others' playlists to your account. I find this app to be extremely easy to use and plan to continue it as my favorite music app."

60729,"Spotify",2017-08-09,4,"Pretty Great   Great app.  Just wish there was not a fee for no ads and music anywhere. Lots of great music and options. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the premium fee. I know they have to make money somehow. 😁🎵🎶"
60731,"Spotify",2016-09-14,5,"Great App   I love this app! I find it great that you could literally search of almost every song and see it, and how you could go and look at any music for your mood! Although the adds are annoying(not lying, I memorized them), it doesn't come up every 3 or so songs, so I'm happy."
60733,"Spotify",2016-01-12,5,"Give this a go   Great music idea for on the go listening of your favoriat stations and singers. Check to see  if the spotify app is compatable for your android devise."
60743,"Spotify",2017-02-03,4,"Nice but one compliant   This is a great app but my one complaint is that when I open it, it says I am offline, but I am in my own house, and,for some reason, I am only nine but I listen to songs like Your Gonna Go Far Kid by The Offspring. :)"
60744,"Spotify",2017-11-08,5,"Better than my own song library   This app works so well, I'll never pay for another song again."
60746,"Spotify",2015-01-01,4,"Great app but a couple of tweaks could go a long way   I love this app (and Spotify in general) but I guess the thing that continually drives me crazy is that there is no way to properly sort by album name (the album's tab sorts by artists and then by album). I know it sounds nitpicky, but it's one of things I come across all the time and just grates!"

60758,"Spotify",2015-11-04,1,"Disappointed, really.   So yeah, it was nice when I first downloaded it. I got to choose what song I listened to, and I didn't have a limit on however many songs I could skip. Oh, but then here comes this bulls***, I can't choose what song I wanted, it suggests songs that I couldn't care less about, and now I can't even skip it because I've reached my limit, skipping the songs I don't want to listen to.I got an app that wasn't like Pandora, and it was hella nice. But now it's changed into the equivalent of that.To sum it all up,I can't choose my own musicI couldn't care less about the suggested musicI hate the song-skip limitI just wanted to listen to one song, but then I end up listening to ten because I'm unable to skip over to the song I want.I'm just disappointed, tbh."
60759,"Spotify",2017-05-31,5,"Can't do without it.   I listen to it every day. Poor Pandora got left out in the cold. I haven't used the commercial free yet, but plan on it soon."

But lately, when I get the 30 minutes of ad free music, it gives me an ad within two songs. All the time. The ads have increased tremendously and I don't know what's changed.  I know I'm using the free app, but it's ridiculous that they tell me I'm getting 30 minutes of ad free music and then they play an ad after the next song or two"

60815,"Spotify",2017-03-19,5,"Freedom without restrictions   I love that Spotify suggests other music Artists to match the music genre chosen, and allows you to browse through the suggested Artists' music via Singles, Album, or Collaboration and place it in your own created Playlist or one already generated."
60816,"Spotify",2017-01-19,3,"It was great..   It would be nice if it didn't get slower with each update. For whatever reason theres now a lenghty black screen before loading the artist list. It used to be a 5 in my book, but there's ni reason it should take longer to load on a new device."
60819,"Spotify",2017-06-18,5,"YAS   I only got it today and I love it! I'm really into game music and that's there, and it doesn't only do 10 seconds of the music, like downloadable music.

However, with Spotify, you can look up a song and play the whole song, free of charge. They do have very little ads. There is a premium option and that allows you to "" download"" the songs so you can listen to them off of data and Wi-Fi. It also removes the ads. However you have to pay for that feature."

I would have to say that the downside to this app is that if you don't have the premium account, then you can't listen to what ever song you want. Also, you can't listen offline unless you have premium. Other than that, I would recommend this app Ito everyone"

Where it use to be a free any song type thing but if you wanted the lessen off line you get premium. Also this is just my opinion but I just don't enjoy lessening to the radio that's just me. so if you like radio get this app and if like to pick and choose your music and don't mind spending a little money get this app. It is great and there lots of features just not all for free. Other than the premium problem I love this app."

61218,"Spotify",2014-06-10,2,"Not what I thought it would be...   When I initially heard that Spotify would be free on mobile/tablets, I was thrilled.When I saw it wasn't the case on the Kindle, I was sad.When I noticed today that they'd uploaded anew, I was thrilled again.Now, I'm just disappointed.I use Spotify on my computer regularly, and I was glad to see that my playlists uploaded to this app without a hitch.That was approximately the end of that emotion because of the following:1. Without premium, one must be online to listen.Why is this a problem? Because some of the playlists I imported are of music that I own. If I can listen to that music when my computer is offline, why is there no option to download said music to the app?2. One's personal playlists must be played on shuffle.Why is this a problem? Well, it's certainly not the most terrible thing in the world, and I listen to my playlists on shuffle often, but if I start to listen and, a few songs in, decide I want a specific song next, I can't do that.3. It likes to give one suggested songs when one is trying to play one's own playlists. It doesn't have the best algorithm for this.Why is this a problem? If I'm listening to ""The Color Spectrum"" and it decides to throw a song from ""Migrant"" in the mix, that's really jarring.Besides that, its algorithm seems to mainly throw either more of the artist at you (No, I don't like every album that band has put out.) or just lump everything into a few too-big categories (hip-hop, indie, rock, country) and throw the most random s*** from said category at you (And no, (new) Train is nothing like ""Of Great and Mortal Men"".).You only get a small number of skips if you don't have premium. Sounding a little familiar yet?Only it's not. Because that other app you're thinking of has user feedback, upvotes and downvotes. Spotify lacks that. So this app could play all the songs from ""Migrant"" at me a thousand times over and never learn that I hated it.Spotify on my computer? 5 stars.Spotify on my Kindle? I'll stick with Pandora."
61223,"Spotify",2017-09-04,5,"great and free   love it.  can find any type of music and when you play a certain type it will set you up with like type programs for each day.  the 30 second commerical  - every 30 minutes is not painful at all."

61226,"Spotify",2015-11-07,1,"Kindle fires are tablets!!!   I have been using spotify free for a year now, I used to be able to skip as many times as I wanted to and play any song. I can't do that anymore since the most recent update. Spotify is supposed to be free on tablets and computers, meaning you can choose any song and skip as many times as you want but it still has ads. My moms tablet and my dads both have the ""tablet"" version of spotify. Not my kindle, I now have to use the sucky ""mobile"" version like is on my phone. Please recognize kindles as tablets and not phones. Spotify was great. Please fix this!! I don't understand why kindles are considered different than every other tablet."
61242,"Spotify",2015-08-08,1,"awful in my opinion   Whenever I heard about the amazing reviews I decided to download the app. I was impressed by how you could make your own playlists, however it went downhill fast. After playing around with it for a bit I decided to exit the app and do something else.... but couldn't find a way to exit the app! I ended up having to turn off my kindle fire to make it stop playing music. I think the creators had good intentions but there are a lot of bugs that need fixing."

61267,"Spotify",2017-01-19,5,"Spotify is fun   I'm sure I haven't found all there is to learn but what I have so far is very fun.  I like the idea that you say what categories you like and Spotify choses the song it will play.  I don't get bored with them that way."
61271,"Spotify",2014-09-13,1,"used to love it   Doesn't work as well if you aren't a member of Facebook.Also, if you are non paid they play the music in shuffle mode which would be ok if the didn't keep playing the same music more than twice."

61277,"Spotify",2016-09-08,5,"Love it!   This app is great. I love how you can match the music to your run cadence.  I recommend this app and upgrading to premium because not having a commercial interrupt your music is worth the monthly fee."
61279,"Spotify",2016-05-13,5,"Very good for an Amazon app   Spotify is a very very well made app to listen to music on. When you turn on Pandora you deal with advertisements and more. With Spotify advertisements are almost non-existent. The only thing that does need to be implemented is a setting to turn off or take out swear words. All in all this app is a very good app and I recommend this app to anyone who wants some music in their day."

61382,"Spotify",2015-02-24,4,"GREAT APP!!!=> very satisfied   Very good app. Allows u 2 listen music that u want 2 whenever u want. U do need WiFi. Allows u 2 make playlists and save albums and songs. Ah can also follow artists. Although 1 time I made a playlist and after  the first song it would play songs from an album I had not saved. But a very good app. I recommend this 4 anyone who loves music."

This is a great way to not only stay up-to-date with your favourite music stars/groups/composers, but the Spotify playlists are a vrery useful way to discover new ones.

61592,"Spotify",2015-01-06,5,"great but for mobile dev. limitations   The limitations levied on mobile devices intended to manipulate premium purchase are excessive- almost rendering it unusable. But if you're using pc or tablet, spotify basic is great. A competitor is needed to save them from self inflicted alienation of their own consumers, adds and offline mode are incentive enough for premium."
61593,"Spotify",2016-07-03,5,"Awesome!   A lot of people use Pandora, but I prefer Spotify for its hands-on song choice. it really gives a lot of options for making playlists, from radios which are updated and random to choosing song by song. To whoever created Spotify: thanks and awesome job!"

61617,"Spotify",2015-07-10,4,"Sporting is awesome...   The newer versions are becoming more and more difficult functionally though. The button to add songs to your playlist keeps getting smaller and smaller. Make the buttons bigger please (using the kindle version of Spotify)!"

61652,"Spotify",2017-02-12,5,"Great for discovery   Almost all of my favorite music in one place I can take anywhere. Also a powerful tool for discovering new favorites. Unfortunately they've dumbed down the social features and the app can be glitchy. Still deserves 5 stars."

You have a skip limit unless you pay to be a member, you can't have songs on repeat unless your a member, and you can pick the songs you want to play u must use shuffle unless you are a member. Spotify change back other wise more people might go to Pandora."

61731,"Spotify",2014-07-09,4,"Like with one issue   This is a good app.  Spotify is better with a subscription since it allows you to download and listen to it offline.  I was able to cancel sat radio and limit my streaming on my cell with spotify.  I took advantage of the student price for my subscription.  The only issue I have is that I listen to a wide range of music.  One of my favorite genre is kpop.  I am not able to find much to download."
61742,"Spotify",2017-07-26,5,"Great app for 🎶   This is the best music app! Almost all songs are on here (a rare few are not) Great for work or sleep.

61788,"Spotify",2015-06-30,3,"Only one user at a time, unless you pony up another 5 bucks a month   I enjoy spotify.  I do not enjoy that there can be only one user at a time, with an option to purchase another family user at another 4.99 a month.  That part of it kills the experience for me, as I am paying 9.99 a month and only one of us can listen to music at a time.  I think they ought to at least allow two users per subscription, much as Netflix does."

61798,"Spotify",2014-08-03,3,"good, but not as good as it is on apple devices   While I love spotify, this app has a few glitches. Sometimes when I play a song, it won't have any sound, which gets rather irritating after a while. I also have found that spotify on apple devices (iPad, iPhone) is extremely better to navigate and easier to use. If kindle can make the layout more like that, I would change the rating to 5 stars."
61799,"Spotify",2015-09-10,1,"I like it but I hate it too   I love this app for its wide selection on free music, but I hate the way it works. Why do I have to pay money for me to be able to hear the songs I want to hear when I want to!?! Since the last update for the kindle version, I have to click shuffle to go through EVERY song I saved to find the one I want to hear. Thats just ridiculous.

61818,"Spotify",2015-09-13,3,"don't update   I updated Spotify a few days ago, and now you have limited skips. When I first got this app I liked it because it wasn't like any other music app. You could choose and skip any song you wanted but if you update it takes that away. I hope it turns back to normal soon."

I don't have a credit card, so I'm not able to get premium. :(Asides from that, everything is awesome. I'm able to find whatever music I want (except a lot of anime ops) and I only get a few adds. Way better than iTunes Radio and Pandora, if you ask me.If you ask a lot of people."

When I first bought the app for free through the advise of my sister, I was thrilled by the number of skips and how many songs you could download. But turns out these are really members for premium members. All of my downloaded songs were deleted and I was not allowed to skip anymore. What I wonder is why can  easily download songs on the computer but not on my Android phone. I understand that Spotify has gain some money, but I do not like this feature. Also. they play unrelated songs when your trial is over. You could get all the features you want, but only if you upgrade to premium membership."

62337,"Spotify",2015-08-26,1,"KINDLE FIRE IS A TABLET SO ANY SONG, RIGHT? NOPE!!!! STUCK WITH SHUFFLE   The functionality of this app is fine and I really enjoy Spotify, but how gimmicky is it to offer any song listening on tablets and desktops but exclude Fires as tablets, which was a strong point of me getting this tablet. I think this is absolutely absurd, and seems like a cash grab at Fire users, forcing us to go &#34;premium&#34; or relegate us to &#34;shuffle&#34; that free mobile users have to use. This is a big deal honestly. The Fires are tablets. Plain and simple, I should be able to choose whichever song I desire with the accompanying AD's. CHOOSE A DIFFERENT STREAMING SERVICE. SPOTIFY IS NOT HONEST IN ADVERTISEMENT."
